DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's my back. It’s been really hurting. Bad. Like, really, really bad. It’s been going on for a little while now, but it got worse this week.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain, and it's significantly worse this week. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It's not just one spot, you know? It feels… all over. But mostly in my lower back. And it shoots down my legs sometimes. Makes it hard to walk. I try to move slow, but even then… oof. It just hurts. I had… some problems before. A long time ago. With… you know… the cancer. That's what the other doctor told me. Is this… is this because of that?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, thank you for sharing that information. It sounds quite painful, and I appreciate you telling me about the previous cancer diagnosis. That’s important context. To clarify, when you say “problems before,” can you tell me specifically what type of cancer you were diagnosed with, and when?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… breast cancer. About… eight years ago, I think? Maybe nine? It was in my left breast. They did… surgery, and… radiation. I think that’s all. I don’t really remember all the details. It was a long time ago, and I try not to think about it too much. I thought it was gone. They said it was gone. So… I didn’t really go back to the doctor much after that. Until now, with my back. It just… started hurting more and more. And now it’s like… really bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s understandable that you wouldn’t want to dwell on a difficult experience, and it’s helpful to know the history of breast cancer and the treatments you received. Now, focusing on your back pain, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s… it’s a sharp pain, mostly. But it also feels… achy, you know? Like a really deep ache. And sometimes it feels like… needles. Little needles poking me. It’s worse when I stand up. Or when I try to bend over. Sitting is okay, for a little while. But then it starts to hurt. And it's like… it makes my legs feel weak. Does that… make sense? I try to tell you what it feels like, but it’s hard. It just hurts. A lot.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Meigs. You’re describing it very clearly. A sharp, aching pain with needle-like sensations that worsens with standing and bending, and is accompanied by leg weakness. That gives me a good starting point. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if anything specifically triggered the recent worsening of your pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so. It didn't happen all at once, you know? It just… slowly got worse. I was helping my daughter clean the garage last weekend. It was a lot of lifting boxes and… moving things around. But I do that all the time. I didn’t think it would be anything. But then… Monday it started hurting really bad. But even before that, it was just… getting a little worse each day. I thought it would go away on its own. But it didn’t. It just kept getting worse and worse. I’m starting to get scared, Doctor. Especially because of… everything else.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history. It's good you're coming in to get it checked out. The gradual onset, and the fact that it worsened with activity, is helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s… that’s been happening too. Not all the time, but… sometimes my feet feel like they’re… asleep. Like pins and needles. And sometimes my legs feel… heavy. Like I can’t lift them very well. It's mostly in my left leg, I think. But sometimes it happens in my right leg too. It comes and goes. But it’s… worrying. Is that… is that bad? It started around the same time as the back pain, I think. Maybe a little before? It’s hard to remember, everything is just… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Numbness, tingling, and a feeling of heaviness in your legs, particularly on the left, which started around the same time as the back pain. That is important information. Now, I’d like to ask about your bowel and bladder function. Have you experienced any changes in your ability to control your bowel movements or urination?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a… personal question, Doctor. I… I haven't really noticed anything different there. No. Everything is… normal, I think. I haven’t had any problems with that. I’m sorry, but that’s a little embarrassing to talk about. Is that… is that important? I’m just a little uncomfortable with that question. I haven't changed my diet, or noticed any changes in… you know… anything like that. It’s just my back and my legs hurting. Really badly.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Meigs, and I apologize if that question was too personal. It’s a standard part of evaluating back pain to rule out any serious nerve compression, but we can certainly move on if you’re not comfortable discussing it further. Since you’re not comfortable discussing that, let’s switch gears. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No chills. And… no, I haven’t lost any weight. I actually think I’ve gained a little weight, if anything. I… I like to eat. It makes me feel better, sometimes. Especially when I’m hurting. But no, no fever, no chills, and no weight loss. Just the back pain and the legs hurting. I'm starting to feel… really worried now. Is this… is this something serious? Is it the cancer coming back? I’m sorry, I’m probably just being silly. But I can’t help but worry.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. Meigs. It's completely understandable to be worried, especially with your history. Your concerns are valid, and I want to assure you we’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on your back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can do that. It hurts to lie down, a little. But… I’ll try to stay still. Just let me know what you need me to do. I’m a little scared, Doctor. But… I trust you. Just tell me what’s going on, okay?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. I appreciate your trust. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to palpate your spine, feeling for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. Okay. Now, can you bend forward, trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, that hurts. Right there… in my lower back. And… a little bit to the left. It’s… a sharp pain. Not like a muscle ache, but… sharp. Ooh! No, I can't touch my toes. It hurts too much. It's really bad when I bend forward. It feels like something is… stuck. And it shoots pain down my legs when I try. I can’t do that, Doctor. It just hurts too much. It’s getting worse, even just trying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for letting me know. I see you're in significant discomfort. I won’t push you to do anything that causes too much pain. I notice some muscle guarding in your lower back, and tenderness to palpation over the lumbar spine, primarily on the left side. You have limited range of motion with forward bending, and that elicits pain radiating down your legs. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to test your strength in your legs. Can you lift each leg up while lying flat?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can try. That’s… okay. A little weak, maybe. But I can do it. Ooh! That’s… that’s much harder. It hurts more to lift my left leg. And it feels… weak. Really weak. I can’t lift it as high as my right leg. And the pain… it’s shooting down my leg again. It feels like… pins and needles. And my back is… really hurting now. It’s just… really hard, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs. Thank you. I observed weakness in your left leg, compared to your right, and noted that lifting your left leg elicits pain radiating down your leg. Now, I’m going to perform a straight leg raise test. Tell me if that causes pain to radiate down your leg.
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes! That’s it! That’s the pain! It shoots down my leg, right there… on the outside of my leg. And it feels like… pins and needles. Please stop, Doctor! That’s really bad. It hurts a lot. That’s the same pain I’ve been feeling… just much worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, thank you. I'm stopping immediately. That’s very helpful information. Based on the physical exam findings – tenderness over the lumbar spine, limited range of motion, weakness in your left leg, and reproduction of radiating pain with straight leg raise – it appears you may have a lumbar radiculopathy, likely caused by compression of a nerve root in your lower back. The fact that you have a history of breast cancer is also relevant, as bone metastasis can sometimes present with similar symptoms. To further evaluate this, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to visualize the nerve roots and assess for any compression. I will also order blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Given your history of breast cancer, I'll also include a serum protein electrophoresis and calcium levels to evaluate for potential bone involvement. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… scary, Doctor. An MRI and… blood work? Is it serious? Bone… what did you say? Metastasis? Is that… is that the cancer coming back? I’m really scared now. I thought it was just my back… but… is it more than that? I… I don't know what to ask. Is it going to hurt? What if… what if it is the cancer? I'm sorry… I'm just… really upset. What do these tests mean?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be upset, Ms. Meigs. It’s okay to feel scared. I want to assure you that ordering these tests doesn’t necessarily mean it is the cancer coming back. It’s a precautionary measure, given your history, to rule out any serious causes of your symptoms and get a clear diagnosis so we can formulate the best plan of care. The MRI will give us detailed images of the structures in your lower back – the vertebrae, the discs, and the nerve roots – and help us identify any potential compression or inflammation. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and help us rule out any other underlying conditions. Serum protein electrophoresis and calcium levels are used to evaluate for potential bone involvement from cancer. The MRI itself is painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will use magnets and radio waves to create the images. It can be a bit loud, and you’ll need to lie very still, but it doesn’t hurt. The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, but that’s all. I understand you’re worried about the possibility of metastasis, which means the cancer has spread from the breast to another part of the body. That is what we are ruling out with these tests. It's important to remember that we don't have enough information yet to make any definitive conclusions. I'm here to answer all your questions and support you through this process. We will discuss the results of the tests as soon as they are available and develop a treatment plan together. Do you have any immediate questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… that… that makes a little bit of sense. It’s just… I'm so scared. It feels like… it never ends. First the breast cancer, and now this… back pain, and… and maybe it's coming back? I… I don't know what to do. Um… how long will the tests take? And when will I get the results? I… I just want to know, so I can… prepare myself, I guess. Will I have to… will I have to have surgery again? What if… what if it’s bad? I’m sorry… I’m just… rambling now. I just… need to know what's going to happen. And… and can you tell me… what are the chances it’s not the cancer? Is it something else? Maybe just a pulled muscle or something? I just want… some hope, I guess. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be scared and to ramble. It’s perfectly okay to need hope. I understand exactly what you’re feeling, and I want to address all your concerns as clearly as possible. The MRI typically takes about 30-45 minutes. The blood work will be processed within a few days, and we should have the results available in about 3-5 business days. I’ll personally review all the results and contact you immediately to discuss them as soon as they are available. As for the chances of it being something else, it's definitely possible. A pulled muscle, a herniated disc, or spinal stenosis are all potential causes of back pain and leg pain. However, given your history of breast cancer, we need to rule out the possibility of bone metastasis. The MRI will help us determine whether there’s any involvement of the bones or nerve roots. I want to be honest with you: there's no way to predict the results of the tests with certainty. But I also want to reassure you that we have many treatment options available, even if it turns out to be metastasis. We can discuss those options in detail once we have the results. These may include pain management, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery, depending on the extent and location of the involvement. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and gathering information. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort while we wait for the results. I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activity or heavy lifting. Do you have any questions about the prescription, or about what to expect during the tests?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… okay. Pain reliever… that would be good. And… avoiding strenuous activity… I can do that. What kind of doctor would I see… if it is the cancer? Would it be the same doctor I saw before? And… is it going to be a long process? Like… lots of appointments, and… and treatment? I just… I don't know if I have the energy for all that again. And… um… I probably should ask… how much does all this cost? I have insurance, but… I don’t want to get a huge bill I can't afford. I'm sorry… I’m just… thinking about everything all at once. It’s just… a lot. I guess I just… need to take things one step at a time, right? What’s the first step? Do I need to schedule the MRI right away?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – one step at a time is the best approach. And it’s perfectly okay to think about everything all at once and to ask about costs and logistics. If it turns out to be metastasis, you would likely be referred to a medical oncologist, who specializes in treating cancer. It’s possible it would be the same oncologist you saw previously, but we can discuss that if and when it becomes necessary. Regarding the process, it would likely involve a series of appointments for further evaluation, staging, and treatment planning. The specific course of treatment would depend on the extent and location of the involvement, as well as your overall health. It can be a challenging journey, but we’ll be with you every step of the way. As for costs, the MRI and blood work will likely be covered by your insurance, but there may be some out-of-pocket expenses, such as copays or deductibles. I recommend contacting your insurance provider to get a clear estimate of your costs. Our billing department can also assist you with navigating the insurance process and exploring financial assistance options. The first step is to schedule the MRI. I’ll have my assistant schedule that for you right away. She’ll also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the test. I'll also give you a prescription for the pain reliever. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. And patient. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. Just… please call me when the results are back. Don't… don't make me wait too long, okay? .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your fear, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. I promise I’ll call you as soon as the results are back – I won’t keep you waiting unnecessarily. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My assistant will be in touch to schedule the MRI. Take care, and try to rest. .
