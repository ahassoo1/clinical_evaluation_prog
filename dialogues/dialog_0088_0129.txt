DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, the NSAIDs, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. It’s probably that, isn’t it? I just need to know if I need some fancy test or what.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about your black stool, and you're wanting to be efficient with your time, which I appreciate. Black, tarry stool can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, and your long-term NSAID use is definitely something we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, let's quickly go through a few questions. When did you first notice the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice? Probably… a week ago? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly. I don't spend my days looking at my stool, if you get my meaning. It just… was black. And I thought, well, it’s the pills. It’s always something with these old bodies, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A week ago is helpful. Has it been consistently black since then, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Consistently. Every time. Look, I'm a practical woman. If it bleeds, it bleeds. Is this going to be a whole ordeal? I've got things to do, you know. Garden to tend. Husband to nag. This isn’t like I’m doubled over in pain or anything. Just… black.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistently black for a week. And no other symptoms like abdominal pain, weakness, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No! No dizziness, no pain. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just getting old. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask me about every little ache and pain? I’m 73, things are going to be a bit… off. I just want to know if I need a test, or if I can just keep taking my pills and forget about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration and I’ll try to be as quick as possible while still being thorough. Just a few more quick questions, then we can discuss testing. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no nausea. And absolutely no vomiting. I have a very strong stomach, thank you very much. I've seen a lot in my life. I worked on engines for fifty years, you know. That’s dirtier than anything your body can produce. Can we please move on? I feel like I'm giving you my entire medical history for a bit of black stool.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting. And you've been taking NSAIDs for years for arthritis. Have you noticed any heartburn or indigestion with the pills?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little bit of heartburn, now and then. But I just take a little antacid. Nothing major. Look, these pills let me live, alright? I can still garden, I can still chase my husband around. If a little black stool is the price I pay, well… I don’t know. Is it dangerous? That’s what I want to know. Is it going to kill me?
DOCTOR: Okay. I appreciate your honesty. The black stool could be from the NSAIDs, but we need to rule out bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Given the consistency and your long-term NSAID use, I recommend a fecal occult blood test and a complete blood count . The FOBT will check for hidden blood in your stool, and the CBC will check your red blood cell levels. Would you be okay with getting those tests done?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. Always tests. Fine. Get them over with. But I want results quickly. I don't do waiting. And explain how I do these tests, alright? I'm not running to a lab. I'll need someone to drive me, and I don't want to make multiple trips. And if it's something serious, I want to know right away. Don't beat around the bush with me. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get this done as efficiently as possible. The fecal occult blood test, or FOBT, involves collecting a small stool sample at home. We’ll give you a kit with instructions – it’s very straightforward. You'll collect three separate samples over three days, and then bring the kit back to the clinic. The lab will analyze it for hidden blood. The CBC requires a simple blood draw, which we can do right here in the office. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, but I will make sure the lab prioritizes it, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. If anything concerning shows up, we'll discuss it immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Three days of… collecting. Lovely. And a blood draw. Fine. As long as it doesn't take forever. And you will call me. Don’t have me sitting here wondering. I've got a life, Doctor. A garden. A husband. Just get it done. And please, no more questions about my… bodily functions. I’m starting to feel like a science project. Let’s just get the kit, and let me go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the lab order for the CBC, and this is the kit for the FOBT with detailed instructions. The nurse will draw your blood before you leave. I’ll have the results sent to me as quickly as possible, and I promise to call you as soon as I review them. If you experience any significant changes in your stool – like it becomes bright red, or you develop severe abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
