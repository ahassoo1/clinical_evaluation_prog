DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, my husband, he insisted. He's been reading things online, naturally, and now he’s quite…concerned about end-of-life matters. He wants me to fill out one of those forms – an advance directive, I believe he called it? Or a POLST form? Honestly, I don't quite understand why this is necessary. I’ve always handled things perfectly well on my own.
DOCTOR: An advance directive… yes. It's… becoming quite common, unfortunately. People spending too much time on the internet, self-diagnosing and creating unnecessary anxieties. It's a legal document outlining your wishes regarding medical treatment should you become unable to communicate them yourself. A POLST form is similar, but more specific, often used by patients with serious illnesses. Frankly, Ms. Chilla, at your age, it's… premature to be dwelling on such matters. However, to appease your husband—and avoid a further barrage of online “research”—we can briefly discuss it. But I assure you, it’s likely a waste of both our time. Before we proceed, let me ask: Are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not! That is precisely my point. I am in excellent health, thank you very much. I maintain a strict diet, I exercise regularly – though I find the gym quite…unrefined – and I’ve never had a serious illness in my life. My husband simply watches too many documentaries. He thinks everything is a potential catastrophe waiting to happen. Honestly, it's rather exhausting. But he won’t let it go. So, if we must discuss this…form…let’s get it over with. I trust it won't be overly complicated?
DOCTOR: "Unrefined," yes, well, I can appreciate that. As for the form, it shouldn’t be overly complicated for someone with your… apparent clarity of mind. It primarily addresses situations where you are unable to make decisions – coma, severe stroke, that sort of thing. It's about assigning a healthcare proxy – someone to make decisions for you. Now, before we delve into specifics, let's establish a baseline. Have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? No. I had the measles as a child, naturally. And I sprained my ankle once while skiing in Switzerland. A rather clumsy waiter bumped into me, actually. But nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized, never had surgery. And I certainly don’t have any chronic conditions. My husband keeps trying to get me to see a cardiologist, claiming my “stress levels” are too high. Ridiculous. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. This whole exercise feels rather…patronizing, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Measles, a sprained ankle… quite common childhood ailments, Ms. Chilla. We're not discussing minor inconveniences, we're establishing a medical history. And frankly, I find your dismissive tone… unhelpful. Very well. Let's move on. Family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… hm. My grandmother, on my mother's side, had diabetes. But she lived to be quite old, actually. Eighty-seven, I believe. And my uncle, my mother’s brother, he had high blood pressure. But again, he lived a long life, though he did enjoy his food rather too much. Honestly, Doctor, we are a rather robust family. We don’t succumb to every little ailment. It’s a matter of good genes, I assure you. And a healthy lifestyle, of course. Though my husband clearly doesn’t appreciate that. Are you taking notes of all of this? It’s important to have an accurate record, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, I am taking notes. Though I assure you, family history of diabetes and hypertension doesn't exactly qualify as a spotless medical lineage. It simply indicates a potential predisposition. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! That is…appalling. I find the very notion offensive. My husband occasionally enjoys a cigar on special occasions, but I make sure he does so outside, far away from me. I consider smoking utterly barbaric and detrimental to one’s health. I have always been very careful about what I put into my body. Organic fruits and vegetables, filtered water, lean protein… I maintain a very strict regimen. It’s the only way to stay healthy, you know. Honestly, Doctor, I find your questions rather… elementary. Are we going to discuss this form at any point, or are we simply cataloging my impeccable lifestyle choices?
DOCTOR: Indeed. Your lifestyle appears… diligent. And, to answer your question, Ms. Chilla, we will get to the form. Eventually. But a complete medical assessment is necessary, however… unnecessary it may seem in your case. Do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. A very small glass, mind you. A good quality French Bordeaux, usually. Or a crisp, dry rosé. But never to excess! I find excessive consumption rather…vulgar. And certainly never alone. It’s a social activity, a civilized indulgence, nothing more. My husband enjoys a bit more, particularly on weekends, but I always ensure he does so responsibly. It's about moderation, Doctor, not deprivation. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather…intrusive. Are we getting any closer to the actual form? Or are we attempting to compile a comprehensive list of my social habits?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, you appear remarkably…concerned with emphasizing the correctness of your habits. However, this is a necessary process. Now, let us discuss any medications you are currently taking. Prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… everything.
PATIENT: Medications? None. Absolutely none. As I mentioned, I pride myself on my excellent health. I haven’t taken a single pill in my life, save for a headache tablet on perhaps three occasions. Vitamins, though. I take a daily multivitamin, naturally. And a Vitamin D supplement, as my husband insists, given my…limited sun exposure. I prefer a reputable Swiss brand, of course. And occasionally, I take a fish oil supplement for my…joints. Preventative measures, Doctor. That is all. Honestly, I find your relentless scrutiny rather…exhausting. Are we nearing the point where we can actually address this…form? Or will you continue to dissect my every lifestyle choice until the end of time?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all respect, it appears you are in excellent health. Which, quite frankly, makes this entire exercise… pointless. However, for the sake of thoroughness—and to appease your husband—let’s briefly discuss your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? None that I am aware of. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions. I eat everything. Shellfish, nuts, dairy…everything. I’ve traveled extensively throughout the world, sampled countless cuisines, and never had a single issue. I occasionally experience a slight sensitivity to dust, but that is hardly an allergy. It’s a minor inconvenience, nothing more. Honestly, Doctor, I find your continued questioning rather…patronizing. Are we finally, finally, going to address this…form? Or will you continue to subject me to this endless interrogation? I have appointments, you know. And my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. As you’ve repeatedly emphasized, you appear to be in excellent health, with no significant medical history, allergies, or medications. Let us, then, proceed with this…document. As your husband requested. It outlines your wishes for medical treatment should you become incapacitated. We will need to designate a healthcare proxy – someone to make decisions on your behalf. Do you have someone in mind?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, of course. My husband, naturally. He is…capable, and he is quite insistent on this whole matter. Though I trust my own judgment implicitly, I suppose it's best to humor him. He's rather good at navigating bureaucracy, and I daresay he’ll ensure everything is done properly. Though I fully expect to remain perfectly capable of making my own decisions for many years to come. Is it a complicated form? I trust it won't require extensive legal expertise. I simply want to get this over with, Doctor. My afternoon tea reservation is at three.
DOCTOR: Very well. As you wish. The form is relatively straightforward, as I mentioned. It primarily involves filling in your personal information, the name of your healthcare proxy – your husband, in this case – and outlining your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment. Please begin. I will be here to answer any… questions. Though, frankly, I anticipate no difficulties.
PATIENT: Very well. Let us be done with this. Though I must say, Doctor, the font is rather small. And the paper quality is…subpar. One would expect a more refined presentation, given the circumstances. “Full Name…” Honestly, the level of detail is quite unnecessary. Do they truly need my middle name for this? It’s hardly relevant…
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla. Unfortunately, the form requires complete information for legal purposes. It’s standard protocol. And, if you would be so kind, please ensure your signature is legible. It’s…important. Do you have any specific wishes regarding resuscitation?
PATIENT: Resuscitation? Doctor, honestly. What a morbid question. I trust my healthcare proxy, my husband, will use his best judgment. I have no desire to dwell on such unpleasant hypotheticals. I live a healthy lifestyle, I maintain a strict regimen, and I fully expect to enjoy many years of good health. To contemplate resuscitation… it’s simply… distasteful. "Emergency Contact Information…" Honestly, must they know everything? It's rather intrusive…
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, while I appreciate your…optimism, it is crucial to consider all possibilities. The purpose of this document is to ensure your wishes are respected, even in the event of an unforeseen medical crisis. Do you have any preferences regarding mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation? Artificial nutrition? Doctor, are you deliberately trying to upset me? Honestly, this is becoming utterly ridiculous. I refuse to contemplate such…ghastly scenarios. I live a healthy life, I maintain a strict regimen, and I fully expect to enjoy many years of good health. To even consider such unpleasant possibilities… it’s simply…barbaric. I’ve filled in my information and designated my husband as my healthcare proxy. That is sufficient. I refuse to dwell on these… morbid details. I have a tea reservation, Doctor, and I'm now considerably delayed. Can we please, please, be done with this?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. You’ve completed the basic information and designated your healthcare proxy. That is…acceptable, I suppose. Though I strongly advise you to reconsider discussing these preferences with your husband at your earliest convenience. We will file this in your chart. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. I trust this…document will suffice. And thank you for your…time. Though I must say, this entire exercise has been rather…unpleasant. Good day, Doctor. And please, do try to have a more…pleasant afternoon.
DOCTOR: Some people… absolutely no sense of perspective. And her husband will be back next week with another list of anxieties. .
