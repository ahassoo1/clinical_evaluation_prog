DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve noticed some swelling, and I thought it best to have it checked out. I don’t quite recall when it started, but it’s been… a little while now, I believe. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Tomassoni. It’s perfectly common to not recall exact dates. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. Could you describe the swelling for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… mostly in my neck, I think. Not all over, thankfully. It feels… soft, not hard, if that makes sense? And it doesn’t really hurt, not unless I press on it quite firmly. It’s just… noticeable, and I’d rather be safe than sorry, you understand. It feels… a little uncomfortable, perhaps. A bit like when you have a mild cold, but not quite.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Soft and non-painful swelling in the neck. And you said it's been going on for a little while – would you estimate weeks, months…?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a good question. I truly wish I could be more precise. Perhaps… a few months, I think? It feels longer than a couple of weeks, certainly. But not a very long time, if that makes any sense at all. It’s… frustrating, I apologize again. My memory isn’t what it once was, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re not needing to apologize, Mr. Tomassoni. We can work with approximations. A few months of soft, non-painful swelling in the neck. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No, not that I'm aware of. No fever, no difficulty breathing, no trouble swallowing… Everything else seems to be functioning normally, as far as I can tell. My appetite is fine, and I haven’t lost any weight. Perhaps a little tired sometimes, but honestly, who isn’t these days? It's difficult to say if that's related or not.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no difficulty breathing or swallowing, normal appetite and weight, and just general fatigue that may or may not be related. Have you noticed any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Changes in my voice… That’s a good question. Hmm. I haven’t specifically noticed anything, no. But… sometimes, people tell me I speak a little quietly. I've always had a tendency to do that, though, so I couldn’t say if it's new. It’s possible, perhaps, but not something I’ve consciously observed myself. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. We're gathering information, and even things that seem small can be important. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Honestly, Doctor, my memory is a bit… hazy. I believe I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that was fairly minor. And… I think I had chickenpox as a child, naturally. Beyond that… I don’t recall any major illnesses or diagnoses. I generally try to stay healthy, if that helps. It's frustrating not to be more certain, I truly apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Tomassoni. It's quite common to not remember every detail. Bronchitis a few years ago and chickenpox as a child. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any surgeries. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, thankfully. I’ve always been careful to avoid any risky activities, and I’ve never had any serious injuries that required an operation. At least, I believe that's the case. I’m nearly certain, but… you understand. My recollections aren’t always the clearest. Perhaps my family doctor has more detailed records?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. We can certainly look into that if necessary. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to medications, and I can eat pretty much anything without any problems. I've tried a variety of foods throughout my life, and nothing has ever bothered me. Again, I'm nearly certain, but my memory… It's frustrating to be so vague, I apologize.
DOCTOR: You’re not needing to apologize, Mr. Tomassoni. We are making progress. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’m not taking anything at all. No prescription medications, no over-the-counter drugs, no vitamins, no supplements… I prefer to try and manage things naturally, if possible. I believe in a healthy diet and regular exercise, and I’ve been fortunate enough to maintain good health without needing any medication. Unless… occasionally, a pain reliever for a headache, perhaps? But nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, occasional pain reliever as needed. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family is… somewhat scattered, and I haven’t always been close to everyone. I know my grandmother on my mother’s side had… I believe it was diabetes, but I’m not entirely certain. And my father’s brother had some heart problems later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. Beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much information. It’s frustrating, I truly apologize. My memory isn’t very reliable when it comes to family matters.
DOCTOR: That's alright. It's common to have limited information about family history. Diabetes in your maternal grandmother and heart problems in your father’s brother. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink alcohol, and I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I've always believed in a healthy lifestyle, and I avoid anything that could potentially harm my well-being. I find that a good diet, regular exercise, and a peaceful mind are the best ways to stay healthy. I much prefer a cup of herbal tea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: An excellent choice. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I typically wake up around seven o’clock, and I start the day with a light breakfast – usually some fruit and yogurt. Then, I head to work – I’m a Speech-Language Pathologist, as you know – and I spend the day working with patients. I generally have a pretty active day, moving around quite a bit. I usually have a simple lunch – perhaps a salad or a sandwich. After work, I try to get some exercise – a walk in the park, or a swim at the local pool, when the weather allows. In the evenings, I enjoy reading, or spending time with friends. I try to get to bed around ten o'clock, to ensure I get enough rest. It’s a fairly routine life, but I find it quite fulfilling. Although, to be honest, some days are more hectic than others, and my routine can be… somewhat disrupted. But generally, that’s how my days unfold.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active and rewarding routine, Mr. Tomassoni. Thank you for sharing that. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to perform a physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing the swelling in your neck. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll palpate your neck to assess the size and consistency of the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it will help. I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I trust your expertise. Please proceed at your own pace, and don’t hesitate to explain anything if I seem… uncomfortable. I apologize in advance if I’m a bit tense. My experiences with doctors haven’t always been pleasant. But I’m willing to cooperate, if it means getting to the bottom of this swelling.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ll take things at your pace, and I will explain everything as we go. Your comfort is my priority. Please lie back on the examination table. Alright, I'm listening to your heart now. Your heart rate is regular and sounds normal. I'm listening to your lungs as well, and they sound clear and open. No unusual sounds detected. Now, I’m gently feeling your neck. I can feel some soft swelling on both sides, but it’s more pronounced on the right side. It's not hard, and it doesn't seem to be particularly tender to the touch. I'm also feeling for any enlarged lymph nodes… I do detect some slightly enlarged lymph nodes on both sides of your neck, but they are small and feel soft. No signs of significant inflammation or infection.
PATIENT: Enlarged lymph nodes… is that something to be concerned about, Doctor? I confess, I'm not very knowledgeable about medical terminology. Is it… serious? I apologize for the incessant questioning, but I tend to overthink these things. I just want to understand what's going on. Is it possible it’s just a… reaction to something? Perhaps an allergy, even though I haven’t noticed anything specific? Or could it be related to stress? I’ve been a bit preoccupied lately.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Tomassoni, and it’s good that you’re asking. Enlarged lymph nodes can have many causes, and they aren’t always a cause for serious concern. They often occur in response to minor infections, such as a common cold, or even stress. In your case, the nodes are small and soft, and there are no other signs of infection, such as fever or redness. However, to rule out any underlying causes, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your white blood cell count and rule out any inflammatory conditions. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid abnormalities can sometimes cause neck swelling. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s always best to be thorough. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. It’s less likely to be a typical allergy, given you haven’t noticed any specific triggers. Stress can contribute to lymph node swelling, but we need to rule out other potential causes first.
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a thyroid check. Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s best to be cautious, as you say. I confess, I’m a little apprehensive about the tests themselves, but I understand it’s necessary. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And will you explain them to me in detail? I prefer to understand everything that’s going on, even if it’s… complicated. I apologize for being so demanding, but I just want to feel… informed. And what happens if the results are abnormal? What are the possible treatments? I understand it’s speculation at this point, but I tend to worry about the worst-case scenario.
DOCTOR: You are not being demanding at all, Mr. Tomassoni. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to understand what’s going on and to be prepared for all possibilities. I will explain everything to you in detail, and I will answer all of your questions to the best of my ability. The blood tests usually take about 2-3 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have the results, I’ll review them carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. If the results are abnormal, it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something serious going on. It could be a minor infection or inflammation that requires a short course of antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medication. In some cases, further investigation may be necessary, such as an ultrasound or biopsy, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. I want to reassure you that we’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll develop a treatment plan that’s tailored to your specific needs, and I’ll make sure you understand all of your options. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve answered all of my questions, for now. I’m still a little anxious, of course, but I feel… reassured, knowing that we’re taking a methodical approach. I suppose I should schedule the blood tests, then? And I'll wait for you to contact me when the results are available? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid any strenuous activity, perhaps? Or is that unnecessary? I apologize for the incessant questioning, but I just want to be prepared. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding, Doctor Shely. It means a great deal to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tomassoni. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Yes, let's schedule the blood tests. I'll have my nurse draw up a requisition for you, and she'll provide you with the location of the nearest lab. In the meantime, there's no need to avoid strenuous activity. Just listen to your body and avoid anything that causes you discomfort. It's also a good idea to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. I'll contact you as soon as the results are available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, difficulty breathing, or significant pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other concerns before we conclude the consultation today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that's everything. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to answer all of my questions. I suppose I should head home, then? And await your call? I confess, I'm still a little anxious, but I feel… better equipped to face whatever comes next. Thank you once again, Doctor Shely. And please, let me know if there's anything I can do to prepare for the blood tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm glad I could help. No, there's nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the blood tests. Just try to relax and get a good night's sleep. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Mr. Tomassoni, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
