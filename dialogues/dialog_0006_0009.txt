DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor Gorga, it’s… my sight. It’s been going. Not suddenly, you understand. Not like a switch. More… fading. Like an old photograph. It’s quite bothersome, really. One has standards, you know.
DOCTOR: Fading… okay. And how long has it been fading, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely. Probably… six months, maybe longer. It’s not something one actively notices day to day, you see. It’s more… realizing things aren't as sharp as they used to be. I suppose I just… adjusted. And then it got to the point where adjusting wasn't enough. A man needs to be able to read the paper, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Six months, progressive… right. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Definitely both. Though… I believe my left eye is slightly worse. Not that I’ve taken to measuring it with a ruler, of course. It’s just… a general impression. One develops a sense of these things. It makes discerning quality rather difficult, frankly. Especially when one is accustomed to a certain… clarity.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes with your vision?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… let me see. There's a… a sort of cloudiness sometimes. Not constant, but it comes and goes. And, honestly, Doctor, colors don’t seem as… vibrant as they once did. Everything looks rather… washed out. It’s a little depressing, if I’m being frank. One appreciates a good autumn landscape, you know. And it’s difficult to appreciate when the colors are so… muted.
DOCTOR: Cloudiness, muted colors… Alright. Do you have any pain with your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not at all. It’s not painful, Doctor. It’s… frustrating. A nuisance, more like. And frankly, a bit worrying. One doesn’t like the idea of things… diminishing. It suggests a general… decline. I assure you, I’ve always taken good care of myself. Good diet, plenty of rest. It’s just… age, I suppose. Though I find that explanation rather… unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: Right, no pain. Okay. Now, have you had any other medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Medical issues… Hmm. Well, I had a bout of… shingles, a few years back. Quite unpleasant. But that's resolved, thankfully. And… high blood pressure, at one point. But I managed that with diet. I believe I’ve managed it, at least. My ex-wife was always very insistent about my salt intake. Perhaps too insistent. Beyond that… nothing significant. Nothing that would explain this, certainly. I assure you, I’m a rather robust individual, generally.
DOCTOR: Shingles, hypertension...Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I prefer to avoid them if at all possible. All those side effects! One reads such dreadful things. And frankly, I’ve always found a good, healthy lifestyle to be far more effective. Although… clearly, it’s not enough in this instance. Which is… disconcerting. I’ve always prided myself on taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve been around dogs, cats, pollen, all sorts of things. Never had a reaction. My ex-wife had a rather extensive garden, you see. She grew everything imaginable. And I certainly didn’t suffer any ill effects from it. I pride myself on being a… resilient individual. Although, clearly, my resilience is failing me now. This vision… it’s truly bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Alcorta, I’d like to take a look at your eyes now. Just a quick exam. We'll check your vision and the health of your eyes. It’ll give us a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Though I must say, I’m not particularly optimistic about what you’ll find. But very well. Proceed. Though, do be gentle. One has sensitive eyes, you understand. And I’d prefer to avoid any… unpleasant procedures, if at all possible. This is already quite distressing as it is.
DOCTOR: Of course. Gentle, I assure you. Just some basic tests. Please, have a seat and look straight ahead. We'll start with a visual acuity test. Okay, I'm going to show you some letters on this chart. Please read the smallest line you can see. With both eyes open, if you would.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I warn you, I suspect my results will be… underwhelming. …E… R… L… P… Hmm. Yes, it’s becoming rather blurry. I believe that’s as far as I can manage, Doctor. Unless… is that a… a Q? It’s difficult to say for certain. The letters seem to be… swimming. A most unpleasant sensation, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. With your left eye covered, can you read the same chart?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Let me… … Oh dear. This is… considerably worse. I can make out the larger letters, barely. But the smaller ones are… completely illegible. It's rather… demoralizing, to be honest. One has always prided oneself on good eyesight. Is that… an F? Perhaps a P? It's terribly difficult to say. Everything seems… hazy. I suspect my results are… quite poor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just going to shine a light into your eyes now. It won’t hurt, just a little bright. Look straight ahead. Hmm… Okay. I’m seeing some mild drusen and a bit of pigmentary change in both eyes. Your maculae appear relatively intact, but there is some early-stage atrophy. And your optic nerves look a bit pale. These findings are consistent with early age-related macular degeneration. The pallor of the optic nerves could indicate some chronic glaucoma as well, but it is difficult to tell without further testing.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Glaucoma? Good heavens. Those sound… dreadful. Are you telling me… I’m going blind, Doctor? Is that what you’re saying? My ex-wife always warned me about the dangers of too much screen time. She was a very… insistent woman. But I never thought… Is there anything… anything at all… that can be done? I refuse to spend my remaining years… fumbling in the dark.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Alcorta, let's not jump to conclusions. "Blindness" is a strong word. Early-stage macular degeneration doesn’t necessarily mean you will go blind. We caught it relatively early, which is good. And the optic nerve changes… we need more testing to determine the extent of any glaucoma. There are things we can do. For the macular degeneration, we can discuss AREDS2 supplements – those have been shown to slow the progression of the disease. We’ll also need to monitor your vision regularly with Amsler grids to detect any changes. For the optic nerves, we’ll need to do some visual field testing and intraocular pressure measurements to assess for glaucoma. If glaucoma is present, we may need to consider eye drops to lower your eye pressure. I’m also going to refer you to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can provide a definitive diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan. It's important to get their expert opinion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Supplements… Amsler grids… visual field testing… It all sounds rather… complicated. And frankly, quite overwhelming. I prefer straightforward solutions, Doctor. Not a series of… procedures and tests and… grids. And an ophthalmologist? Another doctor? Will they simply tell me the same thing? I suppose I have little choice, though. If it slows the progression, as you say. But I must confess, I’m not optimistic. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to take care of myself. Perhaps she was right. Very well. Refer me to this… ophthalmologist. But I’m warning you, Doctor, if this leads to nothing but further distress… I’ll be quite displeased. And do you have a name, at least? Someone reputable, I trust?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll get that referral started for you. I’m recommending Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s a highly respected ophthalmologist specializing in macular degeneration and glaucoma at the Metropolitan Eye Center. Here’s a referral form and her contact information. I understand your skepticism, Mr. Alcorta. But early detection is key with these conditions. Dr. Reed will be able to give you a more detailed assessment and discuss all of your treatment options. It's important to keep your expectations realistic, but there are things we can do to help preserve your vision. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for AREDS2 supplements. And I'll give you an Amsler grid to take home. Check your vision with it daily, and let me know if you notice any changes. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Dr. Evelyn Reed, you say? I shall look her up. Though I trust your judgment, Doctor. To a degree. And the grid… daily, you say? It sounds… tedious. But very well. I’ll endeavor to comply. As for questions… Yes, actually. What are the… side effects of these supplements? I've read dreadful things about vitamins. And is this… condition hereditary? My mother had rather poor eyesight in her later years. I wouldn’t want to… pass this on to anyone. Not that I have anyone to pass it to, mind you. But one still likes to know these things.
DOCTOR: Good questions, Mr. Alcorta. The AREDS2 supplements are generally well-tolerated, but some people experience mild side effects like nausea, stomach upset, or a slight yellowing of the skin. It's rare, but it's something to be aware of. If you experience any significant side effects, stop taking the supplements and let me know. As for heredity, there is a genetic component to both macular degeneration and glaucoma. If you have a family history of either condition, you're at a higher risk. It doesn't mean you'll definitely develop it, but it's something to be aware of. It's also worth noting that lifestyle factors, like smoking and diet, can also play a role. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Lifestyle factors… My ex-wife… was always harping on my diet. And the smoking. She said I should have quit years ago. Though I always found it… relaxing. And to be frank, Doctor, my lifestyle is my own business. No, I believe that covers everything. The supplements, the grid, the ophthalmologist… It’s a rather… daunting prospect. But very well. I shall endeavor to comply. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly hopeful. But I appreciate your… efforts. Perhaps I shall see you again. If my vision hasn't deteriorated completely, of course. .
