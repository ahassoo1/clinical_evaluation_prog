DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it’s this… trouble I’ve been having. It’s… with going to the bathroom, I suppose. It keeps happening again and again. It’s very… bothersome. I don’t quite recall when it started started, exactly. It's been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve been experiencing some bothersome issues with your bladder control. That can certainly be disruptive. When you say “happens again and again,” could you describe what happens?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, disruptive is… a good word. Well, I have to… go, quite often. And it… burns. When I do go. It's not… a nice feeling, not at all. And sometimes… I feel like I haven’t finished, even when I have. Does that make any sense? I don't remember if it’s always like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Wease. Frequent urination, a burning sensation, and the feeling of incomplete emptying… those are all important details. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how often you’re needing to urinate during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… difficult to say. A lot, I suppose. More than usual, certainly. Perhaps… every couple of hours? Maybe even more often than that sometimes. I really can’t be certain. It just feels like… all the time, Doctor. I try not to drink too much, but… still. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to quantify, Ms. Wease, and you're not being a bother at all. “All the time” gives me a helpful starting point. And thank you for mentioning that you try to limit your fluid intake. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Oh, blood? I… I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. But… honestly, Doctor, I don’t always look. It's… unpleasant. And pain? Sometimes my back aches, a little. But I'm an old woman, you know. Aches and pains are to be expected. I don't know if that's the same pain, or different. Everything feels a bit… jumbled.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you haven't observed any blood in your urine. And it's true, aches and pains can be common with age. But it's important to rule out anything else that might be contributing to your symptoms. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… Let me see… I was divorced, if that counts. And… I don't believe so. Not that I know of. I used to go to a doctor, years ago, but… I can’t recall anything specific. No diabetes, no… high blood pressure, I don't think. Everything was always… alright. Until this started, of course. I’m not insured, either, if that makes a difference. It's a bit of a blur, honestly. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. Don’t apologize at all. It’s common to forget details over time, and the lack of insurance can sometimes make keeping track of medical records difficult. Knowing you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes or high blood pressure is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, goodness. Let me think. Years and years ago… I think I had my tonsils out, when I was a little girl. And… perhaps an appendectomy? But it was so long ago, I barely remember. As for being hospitalized… I’ve had the occasional… bug, I suppose. Nothing serious. Nothing that required a long stay. I can’t really recall anything specific. Everything feels… distant. I’m getting quite tired now, Doctor. I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It sounds like those were relatively minor procedures, and a long time ago. I appreciate you trying to recall that information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, dear. No, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Perhaps an aspirin, if I have a headache. But that’s all. I try to avoid pills, if I can. I don’t like them. I think… that’s all. Are we almost finished, Doctor? This is… a bit stressful, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wease. So, no regular medications. That simplifies things. Now, before we move on, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother… she lived to be quite old, I believe. But I don’t recall any specific illnesses. My father… he worked very hard. He wasn’t one for talking about health. And I don’t really know much about their parents, or grandparents. We weren’t a close family, you see. It was… a long time ago. I’m not sure if that's helpful, Doctor. It's all very… hazy. Are you going to give me something for this, finally? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. It's not always easy to recall family history, and it’s alright if you don't have much information. Let's focus on getting you some answers and relief. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. This will involve checking your abdomen and possibly a simple neurological check, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If it’s necessary. But please be gentle, Doctor. I’m an old woman, and everything aches. And… how long will it take? I really don’t want to be here all day. Please, just make it quick. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle as possible. It won't take long, just a few minutes. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I'll gently press on it to check for any tenderness. After that, I'll check your reflexes briefly. If you could lie back for me, please. Take a few deep breaths for me, Ms. Wease. Does that cause any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. It always hurts a little, Doctor. A little bit of pressure always hurts. But… no, not really any pain pain, exactly. Just… discomfort. Yes, discomfort. It’s hard to explain. It feels… tender. Please be careful, Doctor. Don't push too hard.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wease. I am being very gentle. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes briefly. This just involves a light tap on your knees. Could I ask you to cross your legs?
PATIENT: Oh… reflexes? I don’t like doctors poking at me. But… alright. Be careful, Doctor. I’ve got old bones, you know. Don’t hit me too hard! Just… get it over with quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. You can uncross your legs now. Okay, based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam – the tenderness in your lower abdomen and the slightly diminished reflexes – it sounds like you might be experiencing a urinary tract infection, or a condition called overactive bladder. The frequency and burning sensation are common symptoms, and the tenderness suggests some inflammation. However, to confirm this, we'll need to perform a urine test. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine test? More tests? I… I suppose so. If it's necessary. What exactly does that involve? Will it hurt? I really don’t want any more poking. Do you mean I have an infection? Is it… serious? I just want it to stop, Doctor. All of it. It's very bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wease. A urine test is very straightforward. It simply involves collecting a small sample of your urine. It won’t involve any poking or discomfort. You'll just be asked to urinate into a sterile cup. The lab will then analyze the sample to check for bacteria or other signs of infection. The possibility of an infection is what we are investigating. If it is an infection, it is usually treatable with antibiotics. It’s not typically serious, especially if we catch it early. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample now?
PATIENT: Oh… a cup? Well… I suppose so. It’s just… embarrassing. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I can. Where do I go? And… is there anyone else around? I really don't want to be observed. This is… very undignified. Please, just make it quick. I just want to be done with this. And promise me you'll get me some help. I can't live like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your embarrassment, Ms. Wease, and I assure you, we maintain complete privacy. There is a restroom just down the hall. I will give you a sterile cup and instructions. You'll be able to go in complete privacy, and I will not be observing you. Please take your time. When you're finished, just leave the cup on the counter outside the restroom door, and I'll collect it. I'll let you know as soon as the results are available, which should be within a few minutes. Would you like me to step out for a moment while you go?
PATIENT: Oh… would you? Yes, please. That would be… very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. Just… let me know when it’s over. And… please, don't take too long. I just want to go home. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I’ll leave you to it.
