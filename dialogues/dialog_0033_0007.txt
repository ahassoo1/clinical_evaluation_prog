DOCTOR: Right. Lakiya Reihner, 42. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… my back. It hurts. A lot. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible, if we could.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many things hurt. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… alright. It’s lower back. On the left side, mostly. Feels like… a dull ache, all the time. But when I bend over, or lift anything… it’s a sharp pain. Like someone is sticking me with a needle. I do a lot of work with fences, you see. Heavy posts, wire… it's hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Fencing work. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It started… maybe six months ago? At first, it was just a little stiff after work. I thought I just pulled something. But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s just… worse. Each day a little bit worse.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you haven’t sought treatment before now?
PATIENT: No. I haven't. I… well, I just hoped it would go away. I'm not one for doctors if I can avoid it. My husband… he always took care of things. I am widowed, you see. Medicare is what I have for insurance.
DOCTOR: Widowed. Right. And are there any positions or movements that relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Relieve… Hmm. When I lie flat on my back, with my knees bent, that helps some. Not much, but… a little. Standing still also isn’t so bad. But anything that involves twisting or lifting… no. That’s just… awful.
DOCTOR: And any radiating pain?
PATIENT: Radiating? Do you mean… does it go anywhere else? Yes. Sometimes it goes down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of my thigh. It feels… tingly, like pins and needles. It’s not constant, just when the pain is really bad.
DOCTOR: Tingling in the leg… alright. Have you experienced any weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Weakness… not exactly. It feels… heavy, sometimes. Like it takes more effort to lift my foot up. But I haven’t fallen, or tripped, or anything. It’s just… a little harder to do things. It's difficult to explain. I just… want to be able to work. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. We'll start with range of motion and neurological assessment. I'll need you to tell me if you feel any pain during the tests.
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Fine. As long as this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to feel along your spine. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. And can you point to the area where you feel the most pain?
PATIENT: There. Right there. That's the worst. And… when you press down, it shoots that pain down my leg again. Just a little, but it's there. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like you to lie flat on your back. I'm going to lift your left leg straight up in the air. Tell me when you feel pain. How about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. There. Right there. That shoots the pain down my leg. Not all the way, but… it’s a sharp, burning pain. I can't go any further. It’s really bad. Please stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Now bend your left knee and pull it to your chest. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: A little. It's not as bad as lifting the leg straight up, but it’s still uncomfortable. Feels… tight. Like something is pulled. It's not sharp, like before, just… a dull ache. And my lower back feels… worse now. A little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the limited examination, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar radiculopathy, possibly caused by a disc issue. It's difficult to say for certain without imaging. We need to rule out anything more serious. I’m ordering an X-ray to start, and depending on those results, we may need an MRI. I’m also prescribing a short course of muscle relaxants and a pain reliever. However, these are temporary measures. A full recovery will depend on avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Imaging… MRI? Muscle relaxants… I don't want to take a lot of pills. And I need to work. What does avoiding activities mean? I have bills to pay. Will I be able to work at all? I barely understand what you are saying. A disc… issue? Is that serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try to clarify. An MRI is a more detailed picture of your spine, it will help us see if there's a problem with the discs – the cushions between your bones. These can sometimes bulge or tear, pressing on a nerve. The muscle relaxants and pain reliever are just to help manage the discomfort while we figure things out, they’re not a long-term solution. As for avoiding activities, that means no heavy lifting, no bending, and no twisting – at least for a few weeks. I understand you need to work, and we’ll try to accommodate that as much as possible, but continuing to do things that worsen the pain could lead to more serious complications. We can discuss a work restriction note, but it will likely involve limitations. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Work restriction… Limitations? So I can’t do my job? Not at all? How long will this… “limitation” last? I’m not getting any younger. And I don’t understand all these medical words. You are saying I might need more tests. And pills. Is this going to be expensive? I'm on Medicare… will it even cover an MRI? And the pills?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s address your concerns systematically. An MRI is often covered by Medicare, but pre-authorization may be required – the billing department will handle that. As for the cost of medication, your co-pay will depend on your specific plan. Regarding the duration of limitations, it’s difficult to say without knowing the extent of the problem. We’ll reassess after the MRI and adjust the plan accordingly. It may be temporary, but we need more information. As for your ability to work, it depends on your job duties. We can discuss a modified work plan if possible, but it's likely you’ll need to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for a period of time. I’ll write you a prescription for the medication and a referral for the MRI. The nurse will go over the instructions with you. Do you have any specific questions about the medication, or the MRI procedure?
PATIENT: Specific… What are the… side effects of the pills? I don't want to be sleepy all the time, or dizzy. I need to be able to… function. And the MRI… is it safe? Is it painful? Will it show everything? I just want to know what’s wrong, and how to fix it. As quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: The sheet outlines the potential side effects of the muscle relaxant – drowsiness, dizziness, and constipation are the most common. We can adjust the dosage if you experience any of those. The MRI is a painless procedure. You’ll lie in a tube while a strong magnet creates images of your spine. It’s very safe, but please inform the technician if you have any metal implants. It should show the source of your pain, but imaging isn't perfect. The nurse will schedule your MRI and answer any further questions. I’ve also written a preliminary work restriction note, but it's subject to change after we review the results. I’m running behind schedule. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
