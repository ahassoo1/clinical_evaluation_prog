DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… chest hurt. And my heart… feels funny. Like it’s flapping. Been happening a little while now. Not good. I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Chest hurt and heart feels funny.” And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to keep track when you're… busy. It comes and goes. Mostly when I get… stressed. Which is often, these days. People don’t understand what it’s like to keep a city running.
DOCTOR: Right. A few weeks, with stress as a trigger. Can you describe the chest hurt for me?
PATIENT: It’s… tight. Like someone’s squeezing. Not a sharp pain, more like… pressure. And then my heart, it beats too fast. Like a little bird trying to get out of a cage. It's very annoying, honestly. And I get short of breath sometimes. You know, like I can’t get enough air. It's a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness, pressure, fast heartbeat, and shortness of breath. Do you notice anything specifically triggers it besides stress?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes when I’m walking up the stairs. Not every time, but… yeah. Stairs. And… eating too much. My wife makes good food. Too good, sometimes. She doesn’t listen when I say it’s enough. It’s always “just one more bite!” One more bite leads to this, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, walking upstairs and after eating seem to bring it on as well. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how bad does this chest pain get?
PATIENT: Ten is… a lot. I’ve had some aches and pains in my life, you know. But… maybe a six, sometimes. When it’s really bad. Usually it's more like a three or four. Enough to be annoying. I don’t need this. I have important things to do. It’s a waste of my time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six at its worst. Do you have any pain radiating – meaning spreading – anywhere else?
PATIENT: Radiating? You mean… does it go somewhere else? Sometimes… sometimes my left arm feels a little… heavy. And my jaw feels tight too. But maybe that’s just… old age. I don't know. Everything aches these days. Are we almost done here? I have a meeting soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, left arm and jaw. We'll do a quick examination, Mr. Sobkowic, just to get a better picture of what's going on. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. If you could just sit back and relax. And please, try not to get stressed during the exam.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. Fine. But hurry, please. This chair isn't very comfortable. And tell me quickly what you find. I don't want to waste a whole day here. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I hear a murmur. Your blood pressure is a bit high, and your heart rate is a little fast. Lungs sound okay. Do you have any history of high blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Maybe. My wife always tells me to watch my salt. I don’t really pay attention. Never had problems with my heart, not that I know of. I’ve been busy keeping things running, I haven’t got time for… problems. What does this mean? Just tell me straight, doctor. Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, these findings are concerning. Irregular heartbeat and a murmur, along with your symptoms and elevated blood pressure, suggest we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, and I don't want to jump to conclusions. However, we need to rule out a cardiac issue. I'm going to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity and some blood work, including a cardiac enzyme test to see if there’s any heart damage. We'll also need a chest X-ray. I recommend you see a cardiologist as soon as possible. Would you prefer I arrange a referral for you now?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? More doctors? This is getting out of hand. X-rays? EKGs? Look, I understand you're doing your job, but I don't have time for all this. Is it serious? Can't you just… give me a pill? Something to make it stop? I have a city to run. I don’t want to be stuck in hospitals and waiting rooms all day. Just… a quick fix. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand your concerns about time, but I cannot provide a “quick fix” without knowing the cause of your symptoms. Taking a medication without a diagnosis could be dangerous. Your symptoms – chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and shortness of breath – could indicate a serious heart problem. Ignoring this or trying to self-treat could lead to a heart attack or stroke. I strongly recommend you follow through with the tests and see a cardiologist. I can arrange a referral to Dr. Park, who is excellent and takes appointments fairly quickly. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Dr. Park, you said? Okay, arrange it. But make it quick. And tell Dr. Park I don't have all day. I need results fast. And… can you at least give me something now to take until I see this Dr. Park? Just something to calm my nerves. This is very stressful. You understand, right? A busy man… important things to do. Just something… a small pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. I've arranged an appointment with Dr. Park for you tomorrow at 10 AM. I'll send over your chart and test results as soon as they're available. I can prescribe a low dose of a beta-blocker to help manage your heart rate and blood pressure while you wait for your appointment with Dr. Park. It may help with your anxiety as well, but it's important to understand it’s a temporary measure. It won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. I'm also going to give you a handout with warning signs of a heart attack – chest pain, shortness of breath, pain radiating to your arm or jaw, nausea, dizziness. If you experience any of these, call 911 immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Beta-blocker… whatever. As long as it doesn't interfere with my work. And 911… I understand. Look, I appreciate you trying to help. But I really need to get going. Is there anything else? Just tell me if there's anything absolutely critical I need to know before I leave. And… can you write down the name of this Dr. Park again? Just in case my wife asks. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Dr. Park’s name is Dr. Hyun-soo Park, and the number is on the card. The most critical thing is to keep this appointment with Dr. Park. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, call 911 immediately. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. I understand you have a lot on your plate, Mr. Sobkowic, but your health is paramount. We need to rule out a serious cardiac problem, and Dr. Park is the best person to do that. Do you have any further questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… I hope this doesn't take too long. Tell Dr. Park I'm a busy man. Very busy. Alright. Thank you. I guess.
DOCTOR: Have a good day, Mr. Sobkowic. And please, take care of yourself. .
