DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, I don't have time for this, but here I am. I woke up yesterday and… well, I can’t hear on one side. And half my face feels… droopy. It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay. That is concerning. Droopy face and sudden hearing loss. Do you recall anything specific happening right before you noticed this – any dizziness, headache, or weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. Headache, sometimes, who doesn’t get headaches? And dizziness… not particularly. I just woke up and it was like someone flipped a switch. Honestly, I’m a radiologist. I deal with this all day. I don’t need to spend hours explaining basic symptoms. Can we just figure out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane, and appreciate your expertise. But it is important for me to gather a thorough history, even for someone with your background, to ensure I don’t miss anything. Sudden onset like that is something we take seriously. Okay. When you say “half your face feels droopy,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? It… sags. On one side. Like everything is pulling down. It's quite obvious, really. Do I need to demonstrate? It’s affecting my ability to… speak clearly, I suppose. Though I doubt you’ve noticed. It’s not a subtle difference. Honestly, is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It sounds like it's affecting your facial muscles on one side. And you're noticing difficulty with speech. We need to rule out something serious, like a stroke. I'm going to do a quick neurological exam to assess your facial strength and coordination, and also check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stroke? Really? I highly doubt that. I'm perfectly healthy otherwise. But fine, get it over with. Just… be quick about it. I have a very busy schedule. Don’t bother explaining everything, I understand what a “neurological exam” entails.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just look straight ahead, I’m going to check your eye movements. Then I’ll ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and try to close both eyes tightly. Okay, your strength is good in both arms and reflexes are normal. But your smile is noticeably weaker on the left side, and it's harder to fully close your left eye. Do you feel any pain or numbness in your face at all?
PATIENT: No pain. No numbness. Just… weakness. Honestly, it’s terribly irritating. I’m a radiologist, I’ve seen hundreds of these scans. What does it look like on imaging? Can we just get an MRI or something and be done with it? I don’t understand why we have to go through all of this manual testing. It's inefficient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. And I appreciate your medical background. However, a clinical exam is still crucial to guide our imaging decisions and interpret the results accurately. We need to determine the most appropriate imaging study, and an MRI is a strong possibility given your symptoms. You mentioned being perfectly healthy. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. Cholesterol… well, my late husband insisted I get it checked regularly, but I don’t recall anything being… concerning. He was always overly cautious. I generally eat quite well, though I did have a rather rich dessert last week. Does that matter? I find this line of questioning rather… personal and unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I prefer to avoid pharmaceuticals if at all possible. A healthy lifestyle is far more effective, in my opinion. Honestly, I find this entire process rather… demeaning. Is there anything else you need to know before you order your scan? Because I really must get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more quick questions, and then we’ll get you scheduled for an MRI. Have you experienced any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Recent illness? No. Nothing significant. A slight sniffle a few weeks ago, perhaps, but nothing that required a doctor’s visit. I don’t typically bother with minor ailments. My time is valuable. Honestly, I’m starting to suspect this is a waste of both our time. Can we please just proceed with the imaging? I’ve spent enough time detailing my… perfectly normal health history.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None whatsoever. Look, I understand you need to ask these questions, but I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy 59-year-old radiologist. I’m accustomed to being on the other side of this equation. Can we please move on? The MRI, yes? I need to know when it can be scheduled. Preferably today. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, good. Okay, I'm going to order an MRI of your brain with and without contrast to rule out any stroke or other neurological cause for your symptoms. The earliest we can get you in is this afternoon at 3 PM. Please sign this consent form. And I’m going to give you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist, just in case we find anything that requires specialized care. It's best to have a specialist involved from the start. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Three PM. Fine. A neurologist? Honestly, I find that rather… presumptuous. But alright, if that’s your protocol. Just… please expedite this process. I have a practice to run. And I expect a thorough report. I don’t need a simplistic explanation, I can interpret the images myself. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. The MRI request has been sent, and the radiology department will contact you directly to confirm the appointment. Here is the contact information for the MRI facility. Please let them know if you have any implants or metal in your body. And Stephane, even though you are a radiologist, I encourage you to allow Dr. Sharma to review the images with you. A fresh perspective can be very valuable. We will call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—increased weakness, difficulty speaking, severe headache—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. None whatsoever. I believe I’ve made my displeasure with this entire process quite clear. .
