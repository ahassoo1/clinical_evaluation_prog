DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? I'm just… tired. Really tired. And I… well, it's embarrassing, but I been eating dirt. Not like… on purpose, exactly. Just… craving it. It started a few months ago, maybe? I don’t really keep track of dates. It’s just… happening. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran, thank you for sharing that with me. It’s good you’re being open. No need to be embarrassed at all; we’re here to figure things out. "Tired" is a pretty broad symptom, so can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about tired? What is there to say? I’m tired. All the time. Like… bone-deep tired. It’s not like I haven't always been tired, you know? Working with those machines… it takes it outta ya. But this is… worse. I just don’t have the energy for anything. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. I used to garden, but… haven’t touched it in months. I just… sit. Mostly. And eat… well, you know. Is that good enough? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life, and it’s a change from your usual level of tiredness, even considering your work. And you mentioned the dirt-eating started around the same time as the increased fatigue, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, I guess so. Everything's kinda blurry these days. But I'd say… around the same time, yeah. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I want to eat it. It just… feels like I need to. Like something's missing. My husband used to make fun of me for it, back when… well, never mind. It's just… a craving. A weird craving. Look, is this going to take long? I got a shift starting in a few hours.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Cantoran, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. This craving is definitely something we need to explore. It's called pica – the urge to eat non-nutritive substances – and it can sometimes indicate an underlying deficiency. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? What do you mean? I eat. You know… normal stuff. Whatever's easy. I work long hours. I don't have time for fancy cooking. Usually it's… canned soup, sandwiches, leftovers if I have 'em. I used to make tortillas, but… haven’t felt up to it lately. I drink coffee, a lot of coffee. And water. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to what I'm eating, as long as it keeps me going. Now, can we please hurry this along? I'm starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It sounds like your diet is relatively limited, and potentially lacking in certain nutrients. The lightheadedness is concerning. Let's take your blood pressure and check your pulse quickly, just to be safe. Could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Blood pressure is blood pressure. Look, my hands have been… shaky. And I've been getting these headaches, kinda dull, behind my eyes. And I’m cold. All the time. Even when it's hot out. And I bruise easy. I bumped into the door the other day and got a huge purple mark. I haven’t been sleeping well either, always tired even after sleeping. Does that help? I swear, this is all just getting worse. And my memory... it's terrible. I can't remember why I even walked into a room half the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cantoran. That's quite a lot of information, and it’s helpful. The shakiness, headaches, cold sensitivity, easy bruising, sleep problems, and memory issues, combined with the fatigue and pica… these symptoms are raising a few flags. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, and your pulse is a bit weak. I'm concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia, but other things could be contributing as well. I'd like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture. It will include a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and a thyroid panel. Do you have any known allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. My husband was the one who kept track of all that stuff. I just… didn't worry about it. Look, blood work sounds… expensive. I don't have insurance. Can't you just… give me something for the tiredness? A pill, or something? I really can't afford all that testing. I barely make enough to keep the lights on. And I have to get back to work. They'll fire me if I'm gone much longer.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Cantoran. It's a valid worry, and we can definitely discuss options to make this more manageable. While I can’t prescribe something without knowing the cause of your tiredness, I can offer to write a referral to a lab that offers a sliding scale fee based on income. Also, some community health centers offer free or low-cost blood work. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Ugh. Honestly, I don’t remember much. I had… the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… nothing major. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. I had a baby, but that was… a long time ago. Mostly, I’ve just been… healthy enough to work. My husband took me to the doctor when I needed to go. He handled all that. He's gone now, so… I haven't really been to the doctor since. Does that help? I feel so stupid not remembering all this stuff.
DOCTOR: No, you're not stupid at all, Ms. Cantoran. It’s perfectly understandable, especially given your circumstances. It sounds like you haven’t had significant medical issues in the past. Were there any complications during your pregnancy or delivery?
PATIENT: Complications? I… honestly, I don’t recall. It was… difficult. A long labor. But I had a healthy baby. That's all I really remember. My husband… he was very supportive. He took care of everything. I was just… exhausted. It's all a blur now. So long ago. I really wish I could remember more. But I can't. Does it matter? I feel like we're going in circles here. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like the pregnancy and delivery were physically demanding, and it's understandable that you don't remember all the details. We're not going in circles; I'm trying to gather as much information as possible to figure out what's going on. Just a couple more questions, then we can discuss the blood work options. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’ve never needed to be cut open. I’ve always been… lucky, I guess. Maybe that's why I’m so tired now - because I've never had to deal with any serious illness before. Now, look, this is taking too long. I have to get back to work. Can we just skip the tests and give me something for the fatigue? Please? I'm starting to feel dizzy again. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your need to get back to work, Ms. Cantoran. However, prescribing medication without knowing the underlying cause of your fatigue would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. Your symptoms—the fatigue, pica, headaches, shakiness, cold sensitivity, bruising, memory issues, and lightheadedness—are concerning, and they need to be investigated. Given your low blood pressure and pulse, and these other symptoms, I am worried about more than just a simple vitamin deficiency. While a vitamin deficiency is possible, these symptoms could indicate a more serious underlying condition. We need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to strongly recommend we proceed with the blood work, even if we have to explore financial assistance options. I will write a referral for the basic panel, and then we can discuss a sliding scale or community resources. I will also give you a list of local community health centers that offer low-cost or free services. Would you like me to write that referral now?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Write the referral. But if it’s expensive, I’m not paying for it. And if it doesn't fix anything, I'm blaming you. This whole thing is just… stressful. And I have to get back to work. Please, just hurry up. I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Here’s the referral and the list of resources. The tests include a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and thyroid panel. Please call the lab to schedule an appointment, and be sure to mention the referral and ask about their financial assistance options. I’ve also written a note to your primary care physician (if you have one, do you?
