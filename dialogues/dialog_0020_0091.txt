DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It nice to meet you as well. Well, lately I just… I does be very thirsty all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It not making sense, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thirsty all the time and still feeling hungry even after eating… that is unusual. It’s good you brought it up. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start maybe… about a month or so ago? Slowly, at first. I thought it was just the heat, you know, Trinidad does be warm. But it getting worse. I does have to drink water all day long, and I still feel dry. And the hunger… it just… always there. Even when I shouldn't be feeling hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month ago, gradually worsening. And it's not just the heat, you feel. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well… now that you ask… I does feel a little tired, yes. More tired than usual, I mean. I always been a busy woman, working the pump, so I used to have plenty energy. But lately… I does have to sit down more often. And… sometimes, I does feel a little dizzy, if I stand up too fast. But I thought that was just my age, you know? I getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and dizziness upon standing. Those are important things to mention. And it’s good you’re telling me everything, even if it seems small. Let’s talk a little bit more about this hunger. Is it a constant feeling, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It mostly constant, Doctor. Like a empty feeling, always there in my belly. Not a pain, exactly, just… empty. And it doesn't matter what I eat. I could have a big plate of rice and peas, with chicken and salad, and maybe an hour later, I still feeling like I need something. It not normal, is it? I never used to eat so much.
DOCTOR: No, Bianca, that doesn't sound normal at all. Constant hunger, even after eating a full meal… We need to figure out what's going on. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think I might have lost a little weight. Not much, but my clothes feeling a little looser. I didn't really pay it much mind, I been busy with work and all. But yes, I think so. Not a lot, just… noticeable. I not sure how much, though. I don’t have a scale at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss along with the other symptoms. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, Doctor. I does have a little bit of pressure sometimes, but the doctor always tell me it just from working hard. I does take a little tablet for it, sometimes. And… I had the sugar a few years back, but I does watch what I eat, and it went away. I never really liked sweets much anyway. And that’s all, really. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension and a history of pre-diabetes that has since resolved. Do you remember what medication you take for the pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it a little white tablet. I does get it from the pharmacy. I think… amlodipine? Yes, that’s it! Amlodipine. I take one every morning. Sometimes I forget, if I busy, but I try to remember. And like I say, I does watch what I eat. I don’t want the sugar to come back.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine daily. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the amlodipine. I don’t really believe in all them vitamins and supplements. I try to get everything I need from my food. I drink plenty water, and I try to eat healthy, like I say. My husband, he does take some things, but not me. I prefer just the amlodipine.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I never had any problems with allergies, thank goodness. I can eat anything, and I never had a reaction to any medicine before. I always been lucky in that regard. I does get mosquito bites, though! But that not an allergy, is it? Just a nuisance.
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites don’t count! So, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had the sugar, yes. Bad sugar. She had to take injections, towards the end. And my father, he had the pressure too. High pressure, just like me. And… my brother, he had a heart problem, a few years back. That’s all I can really think of, Doctor. Nothing else really stands out. It seems like the sugar and pressure run in my family, though. That’s why I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I say, I work the pump, Doctor. It a physical job. I does lift and carry things, and I on my feet all day. It keeps me busy, but it tiring too. I does walk to work, it not far, and I does help my husband in the garden sometimes. I doesn't go out much, just to the market on Saturdays. And I try to get enough rest when I can, but it hard when you busy. I doesn't smoke or drink alcohol, never liked it. I doesn't do much else, really. Just work and home.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically active job, but potentially tiring. No smoking, no alcohol. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable, you know? I not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let you know everything I’m doing. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature and breathing rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Finally, I'll do a quick abdominal exam. Okay, blood pressure is 145/90. That’s a little elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Temperature is 98.6, and your breathing rate is 16. Not bad, but we'll need to keep an eye on the blood pressure. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears look normal, throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper abdomen. No masses or distension. Alright, everything seems normal on the exam, aside from the elevated blood pressure and some tenderness in your upper abdomen. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and look for other possible causes of your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Blood tests, alright. Whatever you need to know, I'll do. I just want to find out what's going on. I don’t like feeling so thirsty and hungry all the time. And that tenderness… it a little worrying, you know? So yes, do the tests. When will I get the results? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Bianca. We'll keep the tests as minimal as possible to get the information we need. The lab does have a payment plan available, and we can discuss that with the billing department. I will also see if there are any community resources that might be able to assist with the cost. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I’ll write you a requisition form. And while we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of water – even though you’re already thirsty – and eating balanced meals. Try to include protein and fiber in each meal, as this can help stabilize your blood sugar levels. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly. Payment plan… alright. I'll ask at the desk about that. And yes, plenty water and good food. I can do that. Thank you for listening to me, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowing we're doing something about it. So, just the tests and then come back when the results are ready? I'll try to remember to schedule the appointment. I does get a little forgetful sometimes, you know. But I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help. Don't worry about being forgetful, it happens to the best of us. The receptionist will help you schedule the follow-up appointment, and we can even send you a reminder. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or confusion – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here’s the requisition form. I'll see you in a few days.
