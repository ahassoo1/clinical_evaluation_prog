DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellowish, after eating fava beans. I know it sounds odd, but that seems to be the trigger.
DOCTOR: That is interesting, Mande. Feeling tired and noticing a yellowish tinge to your skin after eating fava beans… that does give me a few ideas. Just to be clear, is this a new thing, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: It's happened a couple of times now. The first time, I didn't really connect it to the beans, I just thought I was coming down with something. But then it happened again last week, and I started to wonder… it’s definitely after I eat them. Maybe a month or so now that I've noticed it consistently?
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so of consistent occurrences after fava bean consumption. And you're noticing fatigue and a yellowing of the skin – what part of your skin are you noticing the yellowing most prominently?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly my eyes, I think. Like, the whites of my eyes aren't as white as they used to be. And… I guess my skin is a little paler than usual, with a yellowish tint to it all over. It’s hard to describe, really. I haven’t really told anyone else yet, I felt silly explaining it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you brought it to my attention. Yellowing of the eyes and skin… that points to something called jaundice. Given your history with the fava beans, we need to consider a possible enzyme deficiency called G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition. Before we jump to conclusions, though, I’d like to get a more complete picture. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I've been generally healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing, but nothing major. I haven’t really been to the doctor much over the years, unless it was for a check-up. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, your insurance is relevant – it will help with any testing we might need. Okay, no major medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And I’ve never been in the hospital, thankfully. I’m usually quite careful, and I try to stay healthy. I don't really take any medications regularly either, just over-the-counter things for headaches sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good. No surgeries or hospitalizations, and just occasional over-the-counter headache medication. What about your family?
PATIENT: Do you mean, any family history of illnesses? That’s a good question… My mother, she had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had…something with his blood, I think my father said it was anemia, but I wasn’t very old then, and I don’t remember the details. It wasn’t the kind you get from not enough iron, though, he said it was something…different.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder issues for your mother and a different type of anemia for your grandfather. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I've cut back a lot in the last few years. I hardly drink at all now, maybe a glass once or twice a month. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don't really have much interest in those things. I try to eat pretty healthily, mostly vegetables and lean protein.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs, and a healthy diet. That’s all good to know. Now, one last question about your background before we move onto a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything I can remember. I can eat pretty much anything, which is good. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes I get a little heartburn after eating spicy foods, but that's not really an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn't an allergy. Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mande, thank you for that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness, and I'll check the color of your skin and eyes more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I’m a little worried, but I’m glad we’re figuring things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little pressure, of course, but no pain. Everything feels…normal, I think. I mean, I don't usually poke around my stomach, so it's hard to say. But it's not uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness in your abdomen, that's good. Now, let's take a closer look at your eyes. Yes, I do notice some yellowing of the sclera – the whites of your eyes – as you mentioned. It’s subtle, but it’s there. And your skin does have a slightly yellowish tinge as well. Okay, Mande, based on your symptoms – fatigue, yellowing of the skin and eyes after consuming fava beans – and the findings from my examination, I suspect you may have a condition called Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency. It's a genetic disorder that can cause this type of reaction. To confirm this, I'm going to order a blood test to check your G6PD enzyme levels. We’ll also do a complete blood count and a liver function panel, just to rule out other potential causes of jaundice. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. A blood test sounds sensible. I'm glad you have a name for it, even if it sounds complicated! Is it… serious? What does it mean if I do have it? I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mande. It's good you're asking questions. G6PD deficiency itself isn’t usually serious, but it requires being careful about certain things. People with G6PD deficiency can experience hemolytic anemia – meaning the red blood cells break down – when exposed to certain triggers. Fava beans are one of those triggers, as you’ve discovered. Other triggers include certain medications and infections. The good news is that it's manageable. Once we have the results of the blood test, we can discuss specific things you’ll need to avoid, and I'll provide you with a list of medications that are safe and unsafe to use. We'll also talk about avoiding fava beans and any other potential triggers. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. I'm going to give you a referral to a hematologist – a blood specialist – for a second opinion and further evaluation. It's always good to have another expert weigh in. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. A hematologist sounds like a good idea. I’m relieved to hear it’s manageable, and that knowing what to avoid is key. A list of safe and unsafe medications would be incredibly helpful. I feel much better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Thank you, Dr. Sieh.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I'll get those referrals and lab orders sent to you electronically after this consultation. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening fatigue, shortness of breath, or significant yellowing of your skin or eyes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
