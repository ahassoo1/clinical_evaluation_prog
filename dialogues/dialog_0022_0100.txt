DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you said? That's a nice name. Um... well, honestly, it's this drug test thing. Medicare asked me to come in, I think? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don't really remember all the details. Something about making sure I’m okay, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like this is related to a Medicare request for a drug test. That’s perfectly alright, it can be a bit confusing. They sometimes request these as part of routine health monitoring. Don’t worry, we’ll get this sorted out. First, just to confirm some basics, is your date of birth… and can you verify your insurance information as Medicare?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Medicare, definitely. Let me think... my birthday is... August 14th, 1974. I’m pretty sure that's right. And yes, it's just the regular Medicare, the standard one. I don't have any of those extra plans or anything. It’s been a while since I had to deal with all this paperwork, you see. My husband usually took care of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hughston. That matches what we have on file. So, just to clarify, you received a request from Medicare to come in for a drug test?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A letter, I think. Or maybe a phone call? It was… a while ago. I remember someone saying I needed to get it done, but not much else. I don't really recall why they wanted it done, just that they did. It’s silly, isn't it? I used to be so good with remembering things. Now… not so much. Is it important why they wanted it done?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Hughston. Memory can be tricky! And it is helpful to understand why Medicare requested the test, if possible, so we can make sure we're addressing everything appropriately. Sometimes it's just a random selection, other times there’s a specific reason. Do you happen to recall anything about what the test was supposed to be testing for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Testing for… hmm. I really don’t. I think they just said “drug test.” I don't remember them mentioning any specific drugs. I take a little something for my back pain, a muscle relaxer, but that’s it. I haven't taken anything else in… well, a very long time. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just drink tea these days. And worry. A lot of worrying. But no drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. We will definitely need to document that you are taking a muscle relaxer for your back pain, as that could influence the results. Do you recall the name of the medication and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s… Cyclobenzaprine. Yes, that’s it. And… 10 milligrams. Just one tablet before bed, usually. Sometimes two if my back is really bothering me. But not often. My doctor, Dr. Bell, prescribed it. He’s a good man, Dr. Bell. Retired now, though. That’s why I haven’t seen him in a while. Everything’s changing, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, things do change. Thank you for letting me know about the Cyclobenzaprine, and that Dr. Bell prescribed it. Knowing who prescribed it is helpful too. To proceed with the drug test, I'll need to ask a few more questions about your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… significant illnesses… Well, I had pneumonia a few years back. That was nasty. Had to stay in the hospital for a week. And… I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, maybe… twenty years ago? It was a pretty standard surgery, nothing fancy. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Nothing major, really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia and gallbladder removal. That's helpful to know. And I’m glad to hear you’ve been generally healthy otherwise. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I ate shellfish, but it's been so long I don't know if I still do. It wasn't a bad reaction, just a little itchiness. Nothing life-threatening, thankfully. And no, I don't have any known allergies to medications. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I can remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shellfish allergy, and no known medication allergies. That's good. Now, just a few questions about your family history... Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My mother had… well, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. He passed away when he was fairly young, from a heart attack. And my sister… she had breast cancer, but she’s doing alright now, thankfully. She's a fighter, my sister.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and breast cancer in your sister. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Hughston. Now, just to finish up with the medical history, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Well, I’m widowed, as I mentioned before. My husband, George, passed away about five years ago. We didn’t have any children. I mostly keep to myself these days. I don't really go out much. I used to enjoy gardening, but my back doesn't allow for that anymore. I live alone, in the suburban area, and… well, I mostly just watch television and drink tea. Not a very exciting life, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That sounds peaceful, Ms. Hughston, and it's perfectly alright to take things at your own pace. It’s good to know you live alone and enjoy a quiet life. Before we proceed with the drug test, I want to quickly review. You’re currently taking 10 milligrams of Cyclobenzaprine for back pain, you had pneumonia and gallbladder removal in the past, a possible shellfish allergy, and a family history of high blood pressure, heart trouble, and breast cancer. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. You've got it all. That's a good memory you have, Doctor. I don’t know where my own went! Okay, so what happens with the test now? Do I have to… you know… give a sample? I hope it's not too complicated. I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And yes, the test does involve providing a urine sample. It's a fairly standard procedure, and the collection process is very straightforward. Our nurses will provide you with a private bathroom and clear instructions. They’ll make sure you feel comfortable and answer any questions you have. Do you have any difficulties with urination, or any concerns about providing a sample?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no difficulties with that, thankfully. Just… a little nervous, I suppose. It's just one of those things, isn't it? Being poked and prodded and having to… well, you know. But if you say it's straightforward, I trust you, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Just point me towards the bathroom, and I'll do my best!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the process and guide you to the bathroom. She’s very kind and will walk you through everything. I'll be right here if you have any questions or concerns after you've spoken with her. Just one moment, let me call her now.
