DOCTOR: Right, Jailia. Well, you're quite tall. Let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Nooruddin. It is a pleasure to finally meet you. I am here because, frankly, I am quite concerned. I have been… diminishing, shall we say, despite a perfectly reasonable diet and exercise regime. And, quite disturbingly, I have been experiencing night sweats – a most unpleasant experience, I assure you. It is simply not befitting.
DOCTOR: "Diminishing," is it?
PATIENT: Yes. Weight loss, Doctor. A rather significant weight loss, actually. I maintain a very precise record, and I can assure you it’s not simply a matter of… fluctuations. It's accompanied by a persistent fatigue, which is… inconvenient, to say the least. My husband finds it rather tiresome, and frankly, I require a certain level of energy to manage my work. I am a graphic designer, you see, and precision is paramount.
DOCTOR: Precision, yes. Well, a “significant” weight loss... how much, exactly?
PATIENT: Precisely seven kilograms, Doctor. Over the past three months. I weigh myself daily, first thing in the morning, after… necessary functions, of course. And I record it meticulously in my journal. It is not a vague estimation, I assure you. It is a quantifiable decline. And the fatigue… it’s not merely feeling “tired.” It’s a debilitating exhaustion that interferes with my ability to concentrate on my designs. It's rather… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Seven kilograms… Alright. And you said night sweats?
PATIENT: Yes, quite severe night sweats, Doctor. Not merely a slight dampness, but a complete soaking. It necessitates changing the bed linens, which is… a nuisance. And it’s disrupting my sleep, naturally. I wake up feeling… clammy and quite uncomfortable. It began approximately one month ago, coinciding with a noticeable increase in the fatigue. I have not altered my routine in any significant way, so I fail to understand the cause.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me consider. My appetite has remained consistent, thankfully. I am quite particular about my nutrition, you see. No, the appetite is unchanged. Though, I have been experiencing a… slight increase in thirst. Not excessive, but I find myself reaching for water more frequently than usual. And… I believe my husband mentioned I seem a bit more… irritable. Though, I assure you, that is likely due to the general inconvenience of this entire situation. It is quite disruptive, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fevers?
PATIENT: Fevers? No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I monitor my temperature regularly – it’s part of my… preventative measures, you see. It has remained within the normal range, consistently. I assure you, I am not prone to illness. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Perhaps it’s something… psychological? Though I find that rather unlikely. I am a very grounded individual. It must be something… physical, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Hmm. You don’t have much of a medical history here. No prior significant illnesses, no surgeries… Just a standard childhood vaccination record. Any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. My health has always been… exemplary. As for family history… my mother suffered from occasional migraines, but nothing… substantial. My father was a very robust individual, with no significant ailments whatsoever. No history of… wasting illnesses, or anything remotely similar. Though, my maternal grandmother… she did have a… rather delicate constitution. She was prone to… nervousness. But I fail to see the relevance. I am not a nervous individual, Doctor. I am perfectly composed.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said you’re a graphic designer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am a freelance graphic designer. I specialize in branding and corporate identity. It requires a great deal of concentration, precision, and… aesthetic judgment. I work from home, primarily, which allows me to maintain a… controlled environment. It is a demanding profession, naturally, but I find it quite fulfilling. Though, this fatigue is making it increasingly difficult to meet my deadlines. It is… rather frustrating, to say the least. My clients expect a certain level of… excellence.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we need to rule some things out. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then I'll order some blood work. It's probably nothing, but we need to be thorough. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though, I assure you, the scale will simply confirm my previous measurements. I maintain a very consistent weight, as I’ve explained. Still, I will comply with your request. It is, after all, your professional prerogative.
DOCTOR: One hundred and five pounds… and you said you’re 5’8”?
PATIENT: Precisely. Five feet eight inches. And one hundred and five pounds. As I stated, I am quite meticulous with my measurements. It represents a significant decline from my usual weight of one hundred and thirty-two pounds. It is… concerning, Doctor. I trust you appreciate the gravity of the situation. I have not intentionally lost weight, and I am quite perplexed by this… diminishing trend. Perhaps the blood work will reveal something… definitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are normal… lungs are clear. No tenderness here. Reflexes are normal. Your thyroid feels… normal as well. This is all very preliminary, of course. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We'll also check your vitamin D levels. That should give us a better picture of what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no allergies to medication. I am quite fortunate in that regard. I have occasionally taken over-the-counter antihistamines for seasonal allergies, but I have never experienced an adverse reaction. I trust your chosen tests will be… comprehensive. I would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter. This… decline is simply unacceptable. And the night sweats… they are quite disruptive to my sleep schedule. It is affecting my productivity, and frankly, my overall well-being. I trust you will expedite the process. I have several deadlines approaching.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the requisition. You can get these tests done at the lab across the street. They'll need a copy of your insurance card. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to get some rest. And… try not to worry too much. It's probably nothing serious.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall comply with your instructions and visit the laboratory across the street. I appreciate your… reassurance, though I confess I find it difficult to remain entirely unconcerned. This decline is quite significant, and the night sweats are… unsettling. I trust the results will be forthcoming expeditiously. Thank you for your time.
