DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 53 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, Dondre Hilber. Fifty-three, that's right. Well, it's...trouble going to the bathroom, mostly. Feels like I can’t…empty it all out, you know? It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying. And how long is “a little while,” Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think…maybe a month or so? It started slow, just feeling like I had to go back again soon after I did go. Now it's…more often I have trouble. It’s not painful, not really. Just…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And is this a constant issue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's…pretty constant now, Doctor. Like, most times I try to go, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out. Sometimes it’s better than others, but it's always something. It's not a good feeling. I don't know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Hilber. And have you noticed any other changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Like…what do you mean, changes? I mean, I drink about the same amount of water. I get up at night sometimes to go, but I always have, even when I was younger. No pain, like I said. Just…not emptying. And I don’t feel like I have to go all the time, if that makes sense. It's just…weak, maybe? Like the stream isn't very strong.
DOCTOR: Weak stream…that’s helpful. And you mentioned getting up at night. How many times, roughly, would you say you need to urinate overnight?
PATIENT: Usually just once, Doctor. Maybe twice if I drink a lot of tea in the evening. I like my tea. But it's not every night, and it’s not…a huge amount when I go. It's just…an extra trip, you know? I used to be able to sleep through the night without it, but that’s been a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of those things. No fever, no chills. My back sometimes aches a little, but that’s just my old age, I think. And definitely no blood. Everything looks…normal, except it doesn’t all come out when I go.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well…not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone does. Nothing serious. I’ve mostly been healthy, to be honest. I try to eat right, stay active…you know, the best I can.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries other than the appendix?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the appendix when I was little. Nothing else. My wife…she had a hip replacement a few years back, but that was her. I haven’t had any other surgeries, no.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tough one. My mom…she had diabetes, I think. And my dad…he had some heart trouble when he got older. Nothing really about…going to the bathroom, if that makes sense. My wife's family…I don't know them that well, to be honest. We didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just…sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my back, when it’s really bothering me. But not every day. And that’s about it. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had any problems with anything like that. I eat pretty much everything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. She's…gone now, but I never had any allergies.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Mr. Hilber, I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I want to figure this out. It's just…annoying, you know? I'd like to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and perform a digital rectal exam. This will help me assess your prostate and check for any abnormalities. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. A…digital rectal exam? I’ve heard of those. It doesn't sound very pleasant. But…if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then okay. I’ll…I’ll lie down. Just…let me know if it’s going to be…bad?
DOCTOR: It is a standard procedure, Mr. Hilber. It provides valuable information. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. First, I will listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Take deep breaths for me. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Normal bowel sounds. No abnormalities detected at this time. Now, I will need to perform a digital rectal exam. Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort during the procedure. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Deep breaths…that’s what I’ll do. Just…let me know when you’re done. This…isn't very comfortable, I have to say. It's not painful, but it's…awkward.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. That’s complete. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, and there is some residual urine present. No obvious nodules or tenderness were detected. Based on the examination and your history, it appears you may be experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges and can cause urinary symptoms such as difficulty emptying your bladder. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to get a clearer picture. We will also need to measure your postvoid residual volume to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate.
PATIENT: Okay…BPH. That…sounds complicated. Tests, you say? Urinalysis and…PSA? And measuring…the leftover stuff? Will those tests tell me what I need to do? Is it something…serious? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: BPH is not necessarily serious, Mr. Hilber, but it does require management. The tests will help us determine the severity of the condition and rule out other potential causes, such as infection or, less commonly, prostate cancer. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the PSA blood test will measure the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated in cases of BPH or prostate cancer. The postvoid residual volume measurement will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate, which helps us assess the effectiveness of your bladder emptying. I will provide you with a requisition form for the lab tests. Please schedule an appointment with the lab at your earliest convenience. Once the results are available, we will review them together and discuss the appropriate treatment options, which may include lifestyle modifications, medication, or, in some cases, more invasive procedures. Does that make sense, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Okay…tests, then we talk. Infection or…cancer. That sounds…scary. Lifestyle changes…what does that mean? And medication… I don't like taking pills, Doctor. But I understand. I need to know what’s going on. Thank you. So…just go to the lab, and they’ll do the tests? Will they call me with the results, or do I come back here?
DOCTOR: The lab will process the samples and forward the results to my office. My staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. Lifestyle modifications may include reducing your fluid intake before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises. As for medication, we will discuss the potential benefits and risks before making any decisions. It is important to remember that there are several treatment options available, and we will work together to find the best approach for your individual needs. This brochure provides additional information on benign prostatic hyperplasia. I recommend you review it before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Okay. Less fluids, no caffeine… pelvic floor exercises. That sounds…difficult. No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Just…getting those tests done, and then we’ll see. Thank you for explaining everything. I appreciate it. And…thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
