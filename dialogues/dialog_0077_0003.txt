DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, Doc. It’s this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, and it’s getting annoying. Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my daughter insisted I come. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. We want to make sure everything is alright. “A while now,” you say… could you tell me approximately how long this shaking has been occurring?
PATIENT: Approximately? Goodness, I don’t keep track of these things. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? Longer? It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. It's just…when I try to do something precise, like…holding a fork. Or signing my name. It gets shaky then. Honestly, I just try to avoid doing those things.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's primarily noticeable with fine motor skills – tasks requiring precision. And it’s been present for approximately six months, intermittent in nature. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger the shaking – certain foods, stress, caffeine perhaps?
PATIENT: Trigger? Honestly, Doc, I eat what I want. I'm eighty years old! Stress? Every day is stressful. And coffee? A couple of cups, maybe. I’ve been drinking coffee my whole life. It’s not the coffee, I tell ya. Probably just…old age catching up with me. This is what happens when you live this long, you know. Everything starts to fall apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It's good you’ve been able to maintain your routine. Let's try to gather a bit more information, just to be thorough. Have you noticed any stiffness or pain in your hand, or any other joints?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just…the shaking. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. Trying to eat in public is a disaster. People stare. It's a nuisance, that's what it is. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a lunch date with some friends, and I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide. I just want to rule out anything serious. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I'm old, Doc, everything's changing. My hair’s falling out, my memory’s not what it used to be… I forget what I had for breakfast half the time. Is this a quiz? I don't like quizzes.
DOCTOR: No quiz, Mr. Baide, I apologize if it feels that way. I’m simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. Let’s focus on physical changes, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your walking, balance, or speech?
PATIENT: Walking? No, I walk fine. Maybe a little slower than I used to, but that’s just…age. Balance is alright, I haven't fallen or anything. And my speech is…speech. I’m talking to you, aren’t I? Look, is there a point to all this? My hand shakes a little, so what? People have worse problems, you know.
DOCTOR: You're right, Mr. Baide, many people do. Just to be complete, have you experienced any unintended weight loss, changes in your sleep patterns, or any new fatigue?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Maybe a pound or two. Hard to say. My wife used to weigh me, but…well, she’s gone now. Sleep? I sleep alright, I guess. Wake up a lot during the night, but what old person doesn't? Fatigue? Tired, naturally. I'm eighty! I get tired just thinking about it. Honestly, Doc, I think I’m done with the questions. Can we just…wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I appreciate your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and just have a look at your hands. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. But be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don't poke around too much. Honestly, I don't see what good it's going to do. But… alright. Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Just relax. First, I’ll observe your hands. I see a slight tremor in your right hand, even at rest. Now, could you please extend both arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s shaking, see? What did you expect? It's always worse when you look at it. And it feels…awkward, holding my arms out like this. Can I put them down now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can put them down. Now, could you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. Done. See? It's not exactly smooth, is it? It's hard to do! And you're holding your finger there like it’s going to run away. Just get on with it, Doc. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I see. There is a slight slowness and some difficulty with coordination. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, could you please tap your thumb to each of your fingers, one at a time, starting with your index finger?
PATIENT: There. Done. Are you taking notes on how badly I tap my thumb? Honestly, I used to be good at things. Built a whole house, you know. Now look at me, can't even tap my thumb properly. This is… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. That’s enough for now. I understand your frustration. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it’s possible you are experiencing an essential tremor. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so to be certain, I would like to order some blood work and possibly a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? More doctors? Blood work? Honestly, Doc, this is getting out of hand. Look, I’m eighty years old. I don’t need more tests. I just have a shaky hand. Is it going to kill me? No. Will it ruin my life? No. I’ll just try to avoid holding forks, alright? I don’t want any more poking and prodding. No. No more tests. No neurologist. I'm done. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. I respect your decision. However, I would like to document my findings and recommendations. I will note the tremor, the lack of other neurological symptoms, and your decision against further investigation. I will also suggest that if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, you should contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
