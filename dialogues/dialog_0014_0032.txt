DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osterholm, it’s… a delicate matter, really. Something a man doesn’t readily discuss. Though, at my age, one finds one has to discuss things one would rather not. It’s… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. Quite bothersome, and not at all what one expects. I’ve noticed it for… well, a little while now. Though exactly how long escapes me. Time does rather blur, you see.
DOCTOR: A discharge… right. Okay. And where exactly is this discharge coming from, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor, must you be so… direct? It’s… from down there. Where else would it be coming from? Really. It's quite obvious, isn't it? One doesn't simply announce such things casually. It’s a matter of… privacy, you understand. Though, if you must know, it's… the tip. Yes, the tip of the… appendage. Is that sufficient detail? I find this entire conversation rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… sufficient. And is it painful, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Painful? Not… precisely. It’s more… irritating. A constant… dampness. And occasionally, a slight burning sensation. But it's not a sharp pain, no. More like… a persistent discomfort. Though, one grows accustomed to discomfort at my age, don't you think? My back aches, my knees creak… this is just another annoyance to add to the list, really. It doesn't keep me up at night, if that's what you're asking. Though it is… unpleasant, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has the amount of discharge changed at all recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Now that’s a difficult question. My memory, you see, isn't what it once was. There might have been… a little more lately? Or perhaps a little less. Honestly, I couldn't say with any certainty. It comes and goes, really. One day it’s barely noticeable, the next… well, more noticeable. It’s rather inconsistent. I wish I could provide a more definitive answer, Doctor, but I simply haven’t been keeping meticulous records of my… emissions, shall we say? Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And are there any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Heavens, Doctor, what do you expect? I’m eighty-three years old! There are always other symptoms. My digestion is… questionable. My eyesight is failing. My knees, as I mentioned, creak like an old ship. But you mean… related to this particular… ailment? No, not that I've noticed. No fever, no chills. Nothing… alarming. Just this bothersome discharge and the general decline of a perfectly respectable human being. Is that helpful? Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish discussing these… personal matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any odor associated with the discharge?
PATIENT: Odor? Goodness, Doctor. Must you delve into such… specifics? I suppose… yes. A slight odor. Not… unpleasant, precisely. But not… fresh, either. It's… a masculine odor, if that makes any sense. A sort of… aged aroma. Not overly strong, mind you. One wouldn't notice it unless one were… in close proximity, shall we say. This is becoming increasingly uncomfortable, Doctor. Perhaps there's a simpler solution? A cream, perhaps? I really don't relish the idea of further… examinations.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. It won’t be…pleasant, but it's necessary to rule out anything serious. I understand your discomfort, but it will be brief. Do you agree?
PATIENT: An examination? Now see here, Doctor. I came to you for a simple remedy, not a… a probing investigation. At my age, one has endured quite enough indignity. And frankly, I find the suggestion… rather impertinent. I thought, perhaps, a topical cream would suffice. Is that truly not an option? I'm not comfortable with this. Not at all. This is hardly what I envisioned when I made this appointment. I believe I shall consult with another physician. Perhaps one with a more… conservative approach. Is there another doctor in the practice? One who specializes in… less invasive treatments? .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. I will have the receptionist provide you with a list of other physicians in the area. I must, however, advise you that without a proper examination, it is impossible to determine the cause of your symptoms. .
