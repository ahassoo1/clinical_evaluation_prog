DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... lab work, I think. The usual? Honestly, I don't really keep track of these things anymore. Medicare sent something, and my memory… well, it ain’t what it used to be. Just want to get it done and over with if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: “The usual,” is rather vague, Mr. Croonquist. Medicare likely sent you for your annual wellness check-up, which includes blood work and a physical. It’s important to stay on top of these things, regardless of your recollection. We need to establish a baseline and monitor for changes. Now, to clarify – have you experienced any new symptoms recently?
PATIENT: New symptoms… hmm. I get a little tired, maybe? But I’m seventy-three, Doctor. A little tired is… normal, isn’t it? Nothing specific, no. Just… old. I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Is there a list of things to look out for? That might help me remember.
DOCTOR: “A little tired” can be quite subjective, Mr. Croonquist. Is this fatigue interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfering… not really. I mostly just… sit. I used to work at the power plant, you know? Long shifts, lots of walking. Now… not so much. I get up, eat, maybe watch some TV. It’s just… harder to get going, sometimes. It's probably just old age. Look, can we just do the blood work? I don’t want to bother you with all this.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with the standard blood work panel. However, I must document a basic review of systems. It’s protocol. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight, Mr. Croonquist?
PATIENT: Appetite… not much change, I guess. I eat when I’m hungry. Weight… I think I’ve lost a bit, but honestly, I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. A really long time. Is this going to take much longer? I've got… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Any issues with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… Doctor, with all due respect, is this really necessary? I just want the lab work. I’m not… feeling unwell. I came here because someone told me to. I don’t understand why you need to know all of this. Can we please just get to the blood draw?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, I assure you, this is necessary. A comprehensive assessment allows me to provide the most appropriate care. Dismissing potential issues simply because you “don’t feel unwell” is not sound medical practice. Now, to be clear: are you experiencing any pain, anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes my knees ache. But that’s just… old age! I used to be on my feet all day, working at the plant. That was years ago. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’ve answered enough questions. Can we please just do the blood work? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the blood work. However, I will document “patient unwilling to provide detailed medical history.” It is…unhelpful. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. They are down the hall, room three.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s all I wanted. Just the blood work. I appreciate it. Really. Now, if you’ll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Very good. Please try to remain seated while the phlebotomist draws your blood. And, Mr. Croonquist… do try to remember to schedule a follow-up appointment. It is essential for monitoring your health. .
PATIENT: Follow-up… right. .
