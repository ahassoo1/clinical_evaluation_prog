DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs, dear. They just ache something awful at night. Cramp up, they do. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, a while now. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. So, the aching and cramping are primarily at night, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mostly when I’m trying to sleep. It doesn't bother me much during the day, not unless I’ve been on my feet a lot. Then it's a little sore, but nothing like the nighttime. It wakes me up, you see. It's quite a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… hard to say. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More like a… a tight squeezing. Like someone’s clenching my calf muscles, very hard. And it feels… deep. Not just on the surface, you understand? Deep inside the muscle. I hope that makes sense. It's just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, a deep squeezing sensation. And is it both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Usually both, dear. Though sometimes one will be worse than the other. It seems to switch back and forth. It's not often just one leg, if that makes sense. Both will ache a bit, but one will really cramp up bad. It's… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Alright, both legs, with one sometimes being more affected than the other. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides being at night?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… I do believe stretching helps a little. If I can get myself untangled and pull at my toes, it eases it up some. Not a lot, mind you. But a little. And… well, I don’t know if this is important, but if I sit with my feet up for a while, it feels better too. But then I have to get up eventually, and it comes back. I haven't really noticed anything that makes it worse besides lying down at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, stretching and elevating your legs provides some temporary relief. And it’s worse with lying down. Hmm. Now, Ms. Bilstein, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any problems with swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh… not that I’ve noticed, dear. Not really. I’ve always had… thin legs, you see. So I suppose I wouldn’t notice a little swelling. No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I haven’t had any trouble with my shoes being too tight or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not at all. Just the aching and the cramping. Sometimes, if I’m really trying to get comfortable, I feel a little… stiffness, but not numbness. No, definitely no tingling. I'd remember that, I think. It's a very distinct feeling, numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just aching, cramping, and occasional stiffness. Now, Ms. Bilstein, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well… let me see. My doctor, Dr. Hemlock, passed on some years back now. He told me I had… high blood pressure, I think. But he had me on pills for it, and I took them for a long time. I stopped taking them a while back… maybe ten, fifteen years ago? I can't rightly recall. And… oh, goodness, I forget what else. I used to have terrible arthritis in my hands, but that’s mostly gone now. It just flares up sometimes. I don't really see a doctor much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension and osteoarthritis. And you're currently not taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, that’s right. Not for the blood pressure. I stopped taking those pills, like I said. Dr. Hemlock said to keep an eye on it, but… well, I haven't been back to a doctor in a long while. I just figured I was feeling alright, so… I didn’t bother. Perhaps that was foolish of me. I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Hmm. I don't think so. I haven’t had any trouble with any pills in the past. I used to take aspirin for my arthritis, and that was alright. But… I don’t really take many medications these days. I try to avoid them if I can. My mother always said too much medicine is worse than not enough. I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Bilstein, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your legs. Just so I can get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. It’s awfully kind of you to look at me. My old bones aren’t what they used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. When I palpate your legs, there doesn’t seem to be any significant swelling or tenderness. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t unusual for someone your age. But overall, the physical exam isn’t revealing anything obvious.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… good, I suppose. Though I wish you could see the cramping. It's just a terrible ache. What do you think it is, Doctor? Do you have any idea what’s causing it? Perhaps it’s just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without some further investigation, but given your history and the physical exam, the most likely cause is nocturnal leg cramps. These are common, especially as we get older. However, because you also have a history of hypertension, and you are currently not being treated for it, it’s important to rule out any vascular issues. I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel and a CBC just to get a baseline, and I want to check your blood pressure today. We should also consider a D-dimer test to check for blood clots, given your age and cramping. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, dear, I suppose. I never was one for poking and prodding, but I want to get to the bottom of this aching. High blood pressure… I do recall Dr. Hemlock mentioning that. A D-dimer… is that serious? I just want to be able to sleep through the night again. If those tests will help, then yes, please. Do whatever you think is best. And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. We'll get those ordered right away. The blood draw will take just a few minutes, and the lab usually has the results back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, stretching your calf muscles before bed, and making sure you're getting enough potassium and magnesium in your diet. And I'll have the nurse check your blood pressure now before you go. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds very sensible. Hydrate, stretch, and… potassium, was it? I'll try my best. It's awfully kind of you to take such good care of an old woman like me. I appreciate it very much. And yes, please check my blood pressure. Perhaps that's what's causing all the trouble. I'll just sit here quietly and wait, then. Thank you again, Doctor.
