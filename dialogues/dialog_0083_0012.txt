DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic medical information, they said. I don’t have any pressing concerns, thankfully. Just the form.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Squiers. Many cruise lines do require a physician's statement. We can certainly get that completed for you. To ensure I fill it out accurately, I'll need to gather some information from you. Would you mind if we go through a brief medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. That sounds perfectly sensible. A brief history… yes, I suppose that’s important. Though, truthfully, I’ve not had much trouble with my health, touch wood. But go ahead, please. Ask away. I’ll do my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not at the moment. Nothing at all, actually. I used to take something for my… well, never mind that now, it was years ago. But currently, nothing. Just a cup of tea in the mornings, if that counts! And I try to eat a good diet, lots of vegetables, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach, and I suppose she was right. I can eat anything, use anything… no allergies at all. It’s a blessing, really. Though, I do dislike Brussels sprouts, but that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Squiers, a dislike for Brussels sprouts doesn't count as an allergy! That’s good to know. Now, have you had any significant past medical problems – any serious illnesses, hospitalizations, or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a wee girl, that was a very long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree – a silly thing, really. Apart from that… Oh! My husband, God rest his soul, he was the one who needed hospital visits more than me. He had a bad heart, poor man. I haven’t had any serious illnesses myself, not that I can recall. I was always quite strong, healthy. Just the tonsils and the arm, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. And I understand your husband had some health concerns. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a bit tricky. My mother lived to be eighty-nine, very healthy for her age, but she did have… well, she had a touch of arthritis in her later years. My father… he passed away quite young, a heart condition, I believe. And my brother… he has high blood pressure, I think. It’s not something we talk about much, to be honest. It’s not a cheerful topic, is it? It’s all rather… common, I suppose. Heart trouble and a bit of arthritis seem to run in the family.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Squiers. Heart condition in your father, arthritis in your mother, and high blood pressure in your brother. We appreciate you sharing that, even if it’s not a comfortable topic. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a bit when he was younger, a pipe, but I always hated it. Dreadful habit, really. And I certainly don’t drink much either. A glass of sherry with Christmas dinner, perhaps, but that’s about it. A quiet life, you see. No bad habits to speak of.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Squiers. Now, before we finish up, do you have any known allergies to latex, food, or medication?
PATIENT: Oh, we just covered that, didn’t we? I don’t have any. None at all. I told you, my mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! Are you quite sure you haven’t made a note of that? I'm beginning to feel a bit repetitive now.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Squiers! My apologies – I seem to have skipped over that question already. It’s been a busy morning, and I’m clearly not keeping track as well as I should. You’ve confirmed no known allergies. Thank you for pointing that out. Now, just to confirm, you’re in good health overall, planning a cruise, and need a doctor’s form completed. Is there anything else you’d like me to address before I finish the form?
PATIENT: Oh, it's alright, dear. These things happen. Don't you worry a bit. And yes, that's quite right. Good health, a cruise, and the form. No, I can't think of anything else at the moment. I just want to be sure everything's in order for my trip. It’s a Mediterranean cruise, you know. I’ve always wanted to go. A bit of sunshine and fresh air.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, Ms. Squiers, I’m happy to hear you’re in good health and looking forward to your cruise. I’ve completed the form based on our conversation, and I'll have it printed for you shortly. It confirms your general good health, no known allergies, and no current medications. While the form is printing, would you like me to briefly examine you – just a quick check of your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs – to ensure everything is as it should be?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. I suppose it wouldn't hurt. A quick check… yes, alright. If it puts your mind at ease, and mine, then yes, please. Though, I'm quite sure I'm as fit as a fiddle. Still, better safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, just a few moments. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Your heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Everything sounds good! As expected, you seem very healthy. I’ll document these findings. Okay, the form is now complete. Here you are. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that's lovely to hear, Doctor. Thank you so much. Yes, this all looks correct. “No known allergies, no current medications, blood pressure 130/80, heart and lungs clear…” Excellent! You've been very thorough. No, I don't think I have any further questions, thank you. You've put my mind completely at ease. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Squiers. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! Enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. If you experience any health concerns while traveling, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. And don’t forget to take precautions against the sun! Safe travels.
PATIENT: Thank you again for everything. I shall certainly do my best to enjoy the sunshine! Have a lovely day yourself, and goodbye!
