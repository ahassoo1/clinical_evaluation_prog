DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Over two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Started sometime on Sunday, I think. I can’t quite recall what I was doing when they started, specifically, but it’s been pretty much constant since then. It’s exhausting, honestly. Especially trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay. Constant hiccups for over two days... That is bothersome. And impacting your sleep, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, terribly. I keep waking myself up. And my neighbors probably hate me! It’s not just little ones either, some are quite… forceful. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down, all the usual things people suggest. Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. You've tried the common remedies… That's good to know. Just to get a better picture, can you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they feel… normal, I suppose? Like any other hiccup. A quick jerk, a gasp for air. But they come very frequently. Maybe every other breath, or close to it. And, like I said, some of them are quite strong. It’s not painful, just… disruptive. I haven’t noticed anything that makes them worse, specifically.
DOCTOR: Alright. Frequent hiccups, not painful, and no obvious triggers… Have you noticed any other symptoms at all alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven't felt sick or anything. No fever, no stomach pain, no dizziness. Just… the hiccups. I’m a little tired, but that’s probably from not sleeping properly, honestly. Oh! And maybe a little heartburn yesterday evening, but I get that sometimes anyway. It wasn't anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms, just the hiccups and a bit of occasional heartburn… Let’s talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's managed with medication. Otherwise, I’m generally healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. And I don't have any allergies that I know of. I’m taking the blood pressure medication, of course, and a daily multivitamin. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a multivitamin. Do you remember the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think… It’s Lisinopril. I take 20mg every morning. I’ve been on it for about five years now, I think. And, like I said, it seems to be working well - my doctor checks it regularly. I had my last check-up about six months ago, and everything was fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure, last check-up six months ago. Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Nothing like that. Just the usual check-ups and things like vaccinations. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. And I had my tonsils taken out as a child, but it was a very routine procedure, nothing complicated. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and tonsils removed as a child, otherwise no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Do you mean, any family history of medical problems? Hmm… My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart problems. He had a stroke a few years before he passed away. And my brother has high cholesterol, but other than that, nothing major that I can think of. It's not a particularly unhealthy family, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, high cholesterol in your brother. I'm making a note of that. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an entertainment manager - mostly organizing events and things like that. It can be a bit stressful, but I enjoy it. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, but it's sometimes difficult with my work schedule. And I don’t get as much exercise as I should, I’m afraid. Mostly just walking when I’m running errands or setting up for events.
DOCTOR: Okay, entertainment manager, non-smoker, occasional wine, tries to eat healthy, and walks for exercise. Alright. And one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Are you taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, just the Lisinopril and the multivitamin, like I said. Nothing else at all. I don’t really believe in herbal remedies, to be honest. I prefer to stick to what my doctor prescribes. I had a friend once who tried some sort of herbal tea and it made her really sick, so I've been cautious ever since.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other medications or supplements. That’s helpful. Okay, Ivette, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll just have a quick look at your throat. It’s just a routine check to make sure everything sounds okay. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please do. It’s probably nothing, but it's good to be thorough, I suppose. I’m a little worried it might be something serious, but I’m trying not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Let me just take a look at your throat… Your throat looks normal, no obvious signs of irritation or infection. It doesn't seem to be anything obvious causing the hiccups.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. If it’s not my heart or lungs, what could it be? I mean, I’ve been hiccuping for two days! It’s driving me mad. It feels like they're never going to stop.
DOCTOR: Right. Persistent hiccups, like yours, lasting over 48 hours, are considered prolonged. Usually, they resolve on their own, but sometimes we need to investigate a little further. There are several possibilities. Sometimes it’s related to irritation of the diaphragm or phrenic nerve – which controls the diaphragm. Other times, it can be a side effect of certain medications… Though Lisinopril isn’t a common cause, we should consider it. Less common causes could be metabolic imbalances, or even issues with the central nervous system. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we should rule things out. I'm thinking we should order some blood work to start. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work seems… reasonable. If it's something simple, I'd rather find out. It's just… frustrating. I’m a bit worried about what it might be, if it's not obvious. But you said it's unlikely to be serious, so I’m trying to stay positive. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Will it take long?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel that way. The blood work will be a basic metabolic panel – that checks your electrolytes, kidney function, and blood sugar. We'll also check a CBC – a complete blood count – to make sure your red and white blood cell counts are normal. And, just to be thorough, we’ll check your thyroid function. It’s a pretty standard set of tests, and shouldn’t take long – maybe 15-20 minutes for the draw itself. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend trying some over-the-counter medications that can sometimes help with hiccups – a medication called baclofen can sometimes calm the diaphragm, and I can write you a prescription for that. If the hiccups continue even after that, we may need to consider other options, such as referring you to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Blood work, baclofen… I'm willing to try anything at this point, honestly. I’m just so tired of hiccuping. 24-48 hours… I can definitely manage that. And a referral to a specialist, if needed, is fine too. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve made me feel a lot better just explaining everything. It’s good to know we’re looking into it properly. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any specific things to avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. In the meantime, try to avoid carbonated beverages, spicy foods, and excessive alcohol – those can sometimes trigger hiccups. And try to stay relaxed – stress can make them worse. Also, eat smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones. I'll write you the prescription for the baclofen now. You can pick it up at your pharmacy. The lab results will be sent directly to my office, and I’ll call you as soon as they come back to discuss them. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or vomiting – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You've been very helpful and thorough. I really appreciate it. I’ll try to relax and avoid those foods, and I’ll pick up the prescription. Hopefully, this will do the trick. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I hope you feel better soon. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
