DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Roseburroough. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s about… these little spells, I guess you’d call them. I keep getting… lost. Not lost lost, mind you. More like… things aren’t quite right. I know where I am, usually. It’s just… remembering how I got there, or what I was doing five minutes ago. My wife, she’s been on me about it. Says I ask the same questions twice. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you're experiencing some memory lapses – difficulty recalling recent events or how you arrived at a particular place or situation. And your wife has noticed some repetition in your questions, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it exactly. It's not like I forget everything. I remember things from… well, from a long time ago perfectly fine. Just… the recent stuff is… fuzzy. It's like a film over it, you know? And don’t tell me it's just getting old. I’ve always had a good memory. I ran a tile business for forty years. You need to remember details for that. Colors, sizes, customers… everything. This is… new.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, Mr. Lason. It’s good you can distinguish between long-term and recent memory issues, and that this is a change for you. Running a business for forty years certainly requires a sharp memory! Let’s try to get a better picture of what's been going on. Can you give me an example of one of these 'spells' recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just last week, we were at the market, the one on Main Street. We go every Saturday. I drove, I parked… then I couldn’t remember where I parked. Not the general area, mind you, I knew it was somewhere near the bakery, but I spent a good ten minutes walking around, looking for the car. My wife, she found it eventually. Said I asked her three times if we’d taken the blue shopping bag. And I distinctly remember putting it in the trunk! It's… embarrassing. I used to pride myself on being organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty recalling the specific location of the car after having driven and parked it, and repeating questions even though you recall the action of putting the blue shopping bag in the trunk. That gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed this happening in other situations – at home, while visiting friends, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s not just the market. A couple of days ago, I was making coffee. Simple enough, right? I got the water going, measured the coffee… then I completely forgot what I was doing mid-pour. Just stood there, staring at the coffee pot like I’d never seen one before. My wife had to remind me. And last week, visiting my grandson… I couldn't recall his teacher’s name. I've met her several times. It's happening more and more often, and it's frankly… worrisome. I don't like feeling like I'm losing it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason. It’s certainly unsettling to experience these memory lapses, especially when they start to interfere with everyday activities. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the memory problems?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really… I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I’m 66 years old. That’s to be expected. My wife says I’ve been a little more… irritable, quick to snap at her. Which isn’t like me. But honestly, she’s been nagging me about these spells, so maybe it's just frustration. No headaches, no dizziness… nothing like that. Just the… fog. And the tiredness. It's not debilitating, but I definitely don't have the energy I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased tiredness and some irritability, along with the memory lapses. And no headaches or dizziness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago. Other than that, not much. The doctor always said I had a strong heart. Blood pressure was a little high when I was younger, but it's been controlled with medication for years now. I take a small pill every morning for it. And that’s about it. I’ve always been a healthy eater, mostly Khmer food. Lots of vegetables, rice… not too much processed stuff. I try to stay active, too. Gardening mostly. And walking. Before these spells started, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, controlled high blood pressure with medication, and generally healthy lifestyle. That’s good to know. What medications are you currently taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Just the one, for the blood pressure. It's… Lisinopril, I think. 10 milligrams, every morning with breakfast. My wife handles the refills, so I’m not entirely sure. She keeps track of everything. I just take the pills she gives me. I haven’t changed anything recently, no new medications, no changes in dosage. Same routine for years. Honestly, the only thing that’s changed is… this. This fog.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, taken all sorts of medications over the years… never any trouble. My wife always asks if I'm allergic when I need to see a new doctor, and I always say no. She worries, you see. Always has. But I've always been a sturdy Cambodian man. Tough as nails. I don't get sick easily. This is different. This isn't a cold or the flu. It's… unsettling, like something's wrong with my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I understand your concern – this is different from a typical illness. Now, let's briefly talk about your family history. Do any of your family members have a history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she got… confused towards the end of her life. But she was very old, over ninety. We just assumed it was old age. She’d forget names, ask the same questions… similar to what’s happening to me, now that I think about it. But no one ever talked about it specifically, no formal diagnosis. My father, he was sharp as a tack until the day he died. No memory problems at all. Honestly, in Cambodia, we didn't talk about these things much. We just took care of people as best we could. It wasn’t something you discussed. But yes, my mother… she got confused towards the end.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of confusion in your mother towards the end of her life. Let's move on to your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And definitely no drugs. My wife would kill me. I drink… occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more than that. It’s mostly for the taste, you understand. A little bit of red wine with Khmer food. But it’s not a habit. I don't rely on it. And certainly not enough to cause any problems. I'm a practical man, I don’t waste my time on things like that. A glass of wine, occasionally. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional small glass of wine. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and do a neurological assessment. We’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and some basic cognitive function. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just get to the bottom of this, that’s all I want. I need to know what’s going on. I have a grandson, you see. I want to be there for him. I want to remember his name, remember his birthday… I need to know what's happening to my head. Let's get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason, your vital signs are within a reasonable range. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I lightly tap his knees and check his response. Both reflexes are present and equal. I ask him to close his eyes and touch his nose with his index finger, repeating several times. Coordination appears good. Now, let’s do a simple cognitive test. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… hmm… it's August… the 2nd. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I know that for a fact. My wife and I have a dinner planned with my grandson tomorrow. She reminded me this morning. So it's August 2nd, 2025. See? I'm not completely lost. Just… forgetful sometimes. It’s frustrating, you understand? It’s not like I don't know things. It's just… getting them out. Like they’re stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You remembered the date correctly. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I'll say them, and you try to remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. I have a good memory, usually. Just… test me. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. I did it. See? I can remember things. It's not like my brain is completely gone. Just… test me. What's next? This is a little stressful, you know? Makes me even more anxious, which probably makes it harder to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You remembered those correctly. Now, let's move on to some other questions. I’m going to ask you to spell the word "WORLD" backwards.
PATIENT: … D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? D-L-R-O-W. It’s a bit tricky backwards… my brain isn't as quick as it used to be. My wife always said I was better at building things than spelling. It's… it's taking effort. I don't normally struggle with something like that. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s close – it’s W-O-R-L-D. But that’s alright, it’s a challenging task. Now, let’s try a simple drawing. I want you to draw a clock, showing ten minutes after eleven. Draw the hands on the clock. I have a piece of paper and a pen here for you. Take your time.
PATIENT: … This is… more difficult than I thought. I know what ten minutes after eleven looks like. But… getting it onto the paper… it’s not coming out right. I used to be good at technical drawings, when I was building things. But… I'm frustrated now. It's like my hand isn't listening to my brain. This is… very unsettling, Doctor. I'm not usually this clumsy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Lason. That's perfectly alright. You've given me enough information for now. From this brief assessment, it seems you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with recall and visuospatial skills. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these issues, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work, neurologist… I just want to know what’s happening. This uncertainty is… unsettling. My wife will be pleased you're taking this seriously. She’s been urging me to see a doctor for weeks. I just… I didn’t want to admit there was a problem. But… it’s getting worse, isn’t it? So, blood work and a neurologist. Yes. Please, just tell me what’s happening. That's all I want. Is it something serious? Will I… will I forget everything?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Lason. These concerns are valid. The blood work and neurological evaluation will help us determine the cause of your cognitive difficulties and guide appropriate treatment. It's too early to say definitively whether it's something serious, or what the future holds. Many things can cause these symptoms, some of which are reversible. The most important thing is to identify the underlying cause so we can develop a plan. The neurologist will perform more detailed tests to assess your memory, attention, language, and other cognitive functions. They will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and discuss treatment options with you. I want to assure you that we'll approach this systematically and provide you with the best possible care. I'll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have along the way. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling an appointment with the neurologist. I'll have my nurse give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. Do you have any questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: No… not right now. Just… the paperwork, then. And the appointment. Yes. I suppose… I suppose I just need to take it one step at a time. My wife… she’ll be happy you're taking this seriously. She worries so much. And… I don’t want to worry her more than necessary. Just… get the tests done. Find out what’s happening. That's all. Thank you, Doctor. You seem… competent. That's reassuring. Now… let's get the paperwork. And then… I suppose I'll tell my wife. This will be… a difficult conversation.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and instructions. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, let your wife know she's welcome to join you during the neurological evaluation. It's often helpful to have a support person present. Take care, and we'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: … Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. … Tell your wife I said hello. … Bye.
