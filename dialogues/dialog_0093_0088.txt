DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, I’ve been getting this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Ringing in the ears can be quite bothersome, certainly. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s not constant, like. Sometimes it’s really loud, other times I barely notice it. It's like a high-pitched whine, mostly. It's in both ears, I think, but maybe worse in the left one. I don’t know, it’s hard to tell. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Dhanoa. It’s not uncommon for tinnitus—that’s the medical term for ringing in the ears—to fluctuate in intensity and be perceived differently in each ear. You mentioned it's been going on for "a little while." Could you estimate how long, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about three months, maybe a bit longer. It started after I had a really busy weekend at work, if that matters. Lots of loud music and… yeah, a lot of people talking too. I'm a waiter, so it's pretty noisy where I work.
DOCTOR: Three months, and coinciding with a busy weekend at work involving loud noises… that's helpful information. Have you noticed anything specifically that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. When it's really quiet, like when I'm trying to sleep, that's when I notice it the most. And loud noises, ironically, can make it worse too. Like, if I'm around a lot of shouting or something, it just… intensifies. It doesn't really go away completely, but it feels louder, you know? Not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Dhanoa. Often, the perception of tinnitus is more noticeable when there isn't much external sound to mask it. And it’s quite common for noise exposure to exacerbate the symptoms. Now, beyond the ringing, have you experienced any other changes in your hearing, such as difficulty hearing conversations, muffled sounds, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing feels okay, I think. I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing people talk, or anything like that. Sometimes my ears feel a little… blocked, maybe? But it’s not often, and it goes away pretty quickly. I thought it was just wax, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. The occasional feeling of fullness is noted. Now, let’s briefly go through some other medical history to get a more complete picture. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or a sinus infection?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that recently. Last time I was really sick was… maybe last winter? Just a bad cold, nothing serious. I haven't had any problems since then. I get a bit tired sometimes, but that's just from work, I think. Long hours on my feet, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, a demanding job can certainly contribute to fatigue. Have you experienced any dizziness, balance problems, or headaches along with the ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No dizziness, no headaches, and my balance is fine. I work pretty quickly, running around with trays, so I’d notice if that was off! Honestly, the ringing is the main problem. It’s just… annoying, and it makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. Especially when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoyance and difficulty concentrating, especially impacting sleep, can be very disruptive. Now, to complete a more thorough evaluation, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I get checked up every couple of years, just a standard check-up, and the doctor always says I'm healthy enough for work. I don't take any regular medication either. I try to eat healthy, mostly, but it's hard when you're busy.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you generally have good health. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Just the occasional painkiller if I get a really bad headache, but that’s maybe once or twice a year. I really don't like taking pills unless I have to. Is this taking long, Doctor? I’ve got to get back to work later today.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Dhanoa, we’re almost finished with the history portion. Just a few more questions. Have you ever had any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: No, never. I'm pretty careful, honestly. I've bumped my head a few times, like everyone does, but nothing serious enough to go to the doctor about. And my ears are fine. I get them cleaned out every now and then, just to be safe. Is there anything else? I really need to get going soon. Work is pretty busy, and they're short-staffed.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a final few questions regarding family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings—who have experienced hearing loss, ringing in the ears, or any other ear-related problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mum always said my grandfather had a bit of trouble hearing when he got older, but I don't know if it was like, ringing or just age-related. No one else, I don't think. We don't really talk about medical stuff much. Is that okay? I feel bad taking up your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Dhanoa. It’s helpful to know what you do recall, and it’s common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Now, to get a better understanding of your hearing, I'd like to perform a quick ear examination and a basic hearing test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… make it quick, if possible? I really need to get back to work. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's begin with the ear examination. Please have a seat here in the chair. Alright, Mr. Dhanoa, I'm examining your ears now. I see a small amount of cerumen—that’s earwax—in both canals, but nothing that would be causing significant blockage. Your eardrums appear intact and normal in color. Now, we’ll move on to a simple hearing test. I’m going to place headphones over your ears and play some tones at different frequencies. Just indicate when you can hear the tone, even if it’s very faint. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Just tell me what to do. Hopefully it won’t take too long. I'm a bit worried about the work piling up if I'm gone too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll explain as we go. I'm going to start with your right ear. When you hear a tone, please raise your hand. I play a series of tones at varying frequencies. Okay… and now your left ear. I repeat the test with the left ear. Alright, Mr. Dhanoa, thank you for your patience. The results show a mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, which is consistent with noise exposure. This means you may have some difficulty hearing quieter, higher-pitched sounds. This doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we should address.
PATIENT: Oh. Mild hearing loss? From work? That’s… not good, is it? Is there anything I can do about it? I need to be able to hear customers, you know? It's my job. I don't want to lose it.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’ve identified it now, Mr. Dhanoa. It's very common with your line of work. It doesn’t mean you’re going to lose your job. We have options. Given your symptoms and the test results, it appears you're experiencing noise-induced hearing loss, likely exacerbated by the tinnitus. First, I recommend avoiding further exposure to loud noises as much as possible. I know that's difficult in your profession, so we can discuss using earplugs specifically designed for musicians and waiters—they reduce noise levels without completely blocking sound. Second, we can manage the tinnitus itself. There are strategies to help you cope with the ringing, and in some cases, sound therapy can be beneficial. Would you be open to learning more about those options?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Earplugs sound good. I've seen some waiters wearing them, actually. And anything to help with the ringing would be great. I just want it to stop. What kind of sound therapy are you talking about? Is it expensive? I don’t have a lot of money, to be honest. I’m divorced and… well, things are tight.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Dhanoa. It's important to find solutions that fit your budget. Sound therapy typically involves listening to neutral sounds – like white noise, nature sounds, or even music – at a low volume. It helps to mask the tinnitus and retrain your brain to focus on other sounds. It can be done at home with simple apps or devices, and the cost can be quite minimal – a few dollars for an app subscription, or a small investment in a sound machine. I can provide you with a list of recommended resources and apps. We can also discuss a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing evaluation and personalized treatment plan, if you're interested. They can fit you with custom earplugs and guide you through different sound therapy options. Would you like me to write you a referral?
PATIENT: Yeah, a referral would be great. And the list of apps sounds good too. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and not making me feel… stupid about it, you know? Some doctors just brush you off. This has been really helpful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really need to get back to work before my boss kills me!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. It was my pleasure. Remember, early intervention is key with hearing loss, and we've taken a good first step today. Here’s the referral to the audiologist and the list of app recommendations. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
