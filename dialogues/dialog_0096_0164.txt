DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Haggar, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired, and I’m kind of yellow, which is worrying. It started a few days ago, and I think it might be connected to… fava beans. I ate a good amount of them at a friend’s barbecue.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I hadn’t eaten them in years, and my friend made this wonderful broad bean salad. It was delicious, but then I started feeling unwell. I didn't immediately connect the two, but now I’m wondering if it’s something to do with that. It's just… my skin and eyes are yellowing, and I’m exhausted.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yellowing of the skin and eyes… that’s what we call jaundice. And the timing with the fava beans is… interesting. Now, have you ever been told you have something called G6PD deficiency?
PATIENT: G6PD… deficiency? No, I don’t think so. No one has ever mentioned anything like that to me. I’ve had the usual check-ups, blood tests and things, but I honestly can’t recall anyone saying anything about that. Is that something serious? It sounds… frightening.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition. People with it don't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which helps red blood cells function properly. Certain foods, like fava beans, and some medications can trigger a breakdown of those red blood cells, causing the jaundice you’re experiencing, and the fatigue. It’s more common in people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, although it can occur in others. We’ll need to do a blood test to check your G6PD levels. First though, let’s get a bit more information. Besides the fatigue and the yellowing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Well, my family is Romanian, so maybe that explains it. That’s… that’s good to know, I suppose. As for other symptoms… hmm. I’ve felt a little weak, and a bit dizzy sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. And my urine… it’s been darker than usual, I think. Not terribly dark, but definitely not the normal pale yellow. I haven't had a fever, and I don't have any stomach pain or anything like that. Just tired, weak, dizzy, and a bit yellow. Is the blood test going to be painful? I’m not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: Weakness, dizziness, darker urine… alright. Those symptoms fit. As for the blood test, it’s just a standard prick of the finger, nothing to be alarmed about. A little pinch, that’s all. We’ll need a full blood count as well, to see how low your red blood cell count is. Now, just to be thorough, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Just a pinch, then. I can manage that. As for medications… let me think. I take a multivitamin every day, just a standard one, nothing fancy. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. Just when needed, not regularly. I don't take any other prescription medications, and I don’t really use any creams or anything like that. Oh! And I sometimes take a little bit of garlic supplement for my cholesterol, but again, only when I remember. Is garlic a problem? I’ve heard it can interact with things.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, ibuprofen, garlic… alright. Ibuprofen can sometimes exacerbate things in cases like this, although it’s not usually a major concern. Garlic… well, there is some limited evidence to suggest it can contribute to red blood cell breakdown in susceptible individuals, so it's good you mentioned it. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll check your abdomen, and look at your skin more closely. It’s important to assess the extent of the jaundice, and to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. If you would please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds sensible. I'm happy to lie down. I hope it's not too serious. I just want to feel normal again. Here we go… is there anything I should be doing while you listen? Holding my breath, maybe?
DOCTOR: No, just relax and breathe normally. Alright, heart sounds are normal… lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness… As I suspected, there's noticeable jaundice in the sclera of your eyes and on your skin. It appears moderate. It’s consistent with what you’ve described. Now, let's get those blood tests done and see what the results say. I’ll send you to the lab right away. The nurse will give you the requisition form.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good. Moderate… is that bad? I mean, is it really the fava beans? I just feel a bit silly thinking it’s something I ate. I guess I’ll go see the nurse then. Thank you, Doctor. I hope the results come back quickly.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily silly, Mrs. Haggar. Fava beans can be a trigger in susceptible individuals. And while we need to confirm it with the blood tests, it’s a strong possibility. Moderate means it's noticeable but not severe. We need to monitor it, of course. The nurse will take care of the blood tests. And please, avoid fava beans – and garlic, for now – until we have the results. We’ll know more once the lab work is back, which should be within a couple of hours. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: Right, no fava beans or garlic. Got it. A couple of hours, then. I'll try to relax and not worry too much in the meantime. Thank you again, Doctor Burlingham. I appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you now.
