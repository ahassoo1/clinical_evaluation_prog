DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my skin, I suppose. It’s turned rather yellow, hasn’t it? It’s… unsettling. My niece suggested I come see someone. She said it could be serious. Honestly, I don’t recall much beyond that. It's been a bit of a blur, these past few weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand. Yellowing of the skin is certainly something we want to investigate. It can be a sign of several things, so it’s good you came in. And it's perfectly alright that you don't recall all the details – we’ll take our time and figure it out together. When did you first notice this yellowing, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… when did I first notice? That’s… difficult. Perhaps a month ago? Or was it longer? I’ve been feeling rather tired lately too, but it’s hard to say if that’s connected. I do remember my appetite hasn’t been the best. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, give or take. And the tiredness and decreased appetite – those are definitely important things to note. It sounds like you've been experiencing a few changes. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the yellowing a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… all over, I think. My face, certainly. And my hands… yes, my hands are quite yellow. Not a bright yellow, mind you. More… a sort of sickly shade. It isn't painful, thankfully. Just… noticeable. And worrying. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Sickly shade" is a helpful description, thank you. It's good to know it's not painful, but you're right, it's certainly something we need to address. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the yellowing, like changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh, my… urine and stool? I… I don’t pay much attention to those things, Doctor. Truly. I’m afraid I can’t say. Everything’s just… a bit of a fog. My niece usually handles things like that, if I’m being honest. She's very good at keeping track of these matters. I wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. It's very common for people to not regularly monitor those things. We can work around that. No need to worry. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Liver disease… now that… that sounds familiar. My niece mentioned something about that, yes. A long time ago, I think. I had some tests done, years and years ago. Hepatitis, perhaps? I honestly don't recall the specifics. It wasn’t… severe, as far as I remember. Just… something I had to keep an eye on. Is it bad? Is it connected to this yellowing?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, thank you. Hepatitis can certainly be connected to yellowing of the skin, also known as jaundice. It’s good you had tests done previously. We’ll need to review those records if possible. Do you happen to know what type of hepatitis you were tested for, or where those tests were performed?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. I truly don’t. It was… so long ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention to the details. It was at… the city hospital, I believe. The big one. But that’s all I can recall, I’m afraid. I’m not very good with names or dates, you see. My memory… it just isn't what it used to be. Is it possible to find the records? Would you be able to help me with that?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Durig. We can definitely try to obtain those records from the city hospital. It might take a little time, but we’ll do our best. I'll have my assistant help you with the necessary paperwork to authorize the release of those records. In the meantime, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a small pill for my blood pressure, I believe. A white one. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for the pain. But that’s only as needed. And… I used to take vitamins, but I stopped a while ago. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just drink tea. That's about all, I think. I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and occasional pain relief for arthritis. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… no. I really don’t. It’s a small white pill, as I said. My niece handles refilling it, so I don’t usually pay attention to the name. She orders it from the pharmacy, and I just take it as directed. I'm afraid I'm not very helpful with these details. Perhaps she knows the name?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. We can certainly ask your niece. It's very common for people to rely on family members for medication management. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Perhaps a slight rash once or twice, but nothing significant. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty hardy person. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I wanted without any problems. But I suppose it’s always best to be careful.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, or children—who have had any serious medical conditions, such as liver disease, heart problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s… difficult. My parents passed away a long time ago, and I don’t have any siblings. I never married, so I don’t have any children. I haven’t spoken to many relatives in years, I’m afraid. It’s been a rather solitary life, to be honest. I don't recall anyone having… serious illnesses, but it's possible. I wasn't very close to my family, you see. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright. It’s not always possible to know a complete family history. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and examine your skin more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to feel better. It’s been… unsettling, this yellowing. I hope you can find out what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Durig. Just take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Just… a little tender, perhaps, on the right side. But nothing severe. It’s always been a bit sensitive, to be honest. It’s nothing to worry about, I’m sure. I’ve always had a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the right upper quadrant. That’s noted. And as you can see, your skin does have a noticeable yellowing, or jaundice. It appears to be most pronounced in your face and hands, as you mentioned. There is also some mild scleral icterus - yellowing of the whites of your eyes. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, the jaundice is certainly concerning. It could be caused by a number of things, including liver problems, gallbladder issues, or even certain medications. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially an imaging scan of your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and a scan… alright. If it will help me feel better, then please do. I trust your judgment completely. Just… please hurry, if you can. I just want to know what’s wrong. This uncertainty is… unsettling. I do hope it's nothing too serious.
