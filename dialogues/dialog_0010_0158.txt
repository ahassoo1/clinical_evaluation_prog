DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Look, it’s about this letter. For… the animal. Yes, the animal. I need a letter saying I can have it, you know? Regulations and all that. Honestly, it’s a bit of a bother, but they won’t let me just have him without it. It's for my… well, it's a dog. A very nice dog. Though, frankly, some people just don't appreciate a good breed.
DOCTOR: Alright, a letter regarding a dog. I understand you need documentation for regulations – is this for an apartment complex, a homeowner's association, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s… a building, yes. A tall building. With… other people. It’s… the place where I live. Honestly, I don’t really pay attention to all the details. They just send these forms! It’s all very… bureaucratic. Is that the right word? Look, they just need a doctor to say it’s okay for me to have a dog. Because… health reasons, I think they said. Something about… companionship. It’s all a bit fuzzy, really. I just want the letter.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a letter for your building management regarding a companion animal, citing health benefits. To be sure I can write a comprehensive letter, could you tell me a little more about why having a dog is important for your health?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Why is it important? Well, don't you think it's obvious? It’s… company! I live alone, you see. A very nice apartment, but… lonely. People just don’t understand. It gets… quiet. And a dog… it’s not quiet. It’s… comforting. It needs walking, which… gets me out. Though I’m not one for strenuous exercise, mind you. It's good to have something to do, you know? Honestly, I don’t see why I have to explain this to a doctor. It’s just… common sense. Are you sure you can’t just write the letter? It feels like a lot of fuss over a perfectly reasonable request.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. It certainly sounds reasonable. I just need to gather a bit more information to ensure the letter is thorough and meets the requirements of your building management. It helps protect both you and the building. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions that might benefit from having a companion animal, such as depression, anxiety, or loneliness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diagnosed? Well, I wouldn’t say diagnosed. I mean, everyone feels a bit down sometimes, don’t they? Especially… living alone. And anxious? Well, there's a lot to worry about these days. The world is a… chaotic place, wouldn’t you agree? Honestly, I just… feel better with the dog. It distracts me. From… things. I don’t really talk about these things. It's… personal. But I assure you, a dog would be very good for my… well-being. I just wish they’d make this easier. It’s all so… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like having the dog significantly improves your emotional well-being, which is excellent. To clarify for the letter, would you be comfortable with me documenting that you experience feelings of loneliness and anxiety that are alleviated by the presence of a companion animal?
PATIENT: Oh, really? You're going to write that down? Well… I suppose. If that's what it takes. But don't make it sound… dramatic. I’m not… ill, you know? Just… a bit lonely sometimes. And anxious. Like anyone else. But please, don’t make me sound like I can’t cope on my own. It’s just… a dog is nice company. And it gets me out. Document it, yes. But keep it… discreet, if you can. Honestly, this whole thing is rather embarrassing. I didn’t realize it would involve so much… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wrye. I will document your statements sensitively and discreetly. I will state that you experience feelings of loneliness and anxiety which are positively impacted by the companionship of a dog, and that having a dog encourages increased activity. Now, to complete the documentation, could you briefly describe your daily routine without the dog, and how you anticipate it changing with the dog present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My routine? Well, it's… rather uneventful, frankly. I wake up, have some tea. Read the newspaper, though it’s mostly bad news these days. Perhaps a bit of television. Lunch. Sometimes I’ll go out to a café, but I mostly stay in. Dinner. More television. And then… bed. It’s… predictable. With the dog? Well, I’d have to get up earlier to take it for a walk, I suppose. Which isn’t ideal. But I’d have someone to talk to, at least. And I’d probably go out more, which… isn’t a bad thing, I guess. I’d have a reason to get out of the house. Honestly, it’s not a dramatic change, but it would… brighten things up a bit. It’s just… nice to have something to care for, you know? Is that enough detail? I’m not one for long explanations.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly sufficient, Ms. Wrye. Thank you. I have all the information I need to write the letter. I will prepare it and have it ready for you before you leave. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just... please, make it sound official. You know, so they can’t argue with it. And… discreet, if you can. I really don’t want to make a fuss. Honestly, this whole thing has been… rather stressful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… humoring me. I just want the letter so I can get on with things. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wrye. I will ensure the letter is professional and clearly states the benefits of having a companion animal. I will also maintain your privacy and discretion. I’ll have it ready for you shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
