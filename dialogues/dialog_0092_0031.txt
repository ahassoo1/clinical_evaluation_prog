DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, my left leg is quite swollen. I’ve been told before I have a funny heartbeat, something called… atrial fib-rill-ation? And I think it might be connected. It’s gotten worse over the last few days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, thank you for letting me know. Swelling in the leg and a history of what sounds like atrial fibrillation – that’s helpful information. It’s good you're connecting the two, as they can certainly be related. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s mostly in my lower leg, Doctor, like from my knee down to my foot. It’s… hard to explain. It feels tight, and it is bigger than my other leg, obviously. It’s a bit painful, if I stand for too long. Not awful, just… uncomfortable. And it’s redder than usual, I think. I haven’t been able to get a good look at it myself, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mainly in the lower leg, from the knee down, tightness, some redness, and it worsens with prolonged standing. And you’ve noticed it’s bigger than your other leg. That’s all good to know. Now, has this swelling come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: It’s… gradual, I think. It didn’t just pop up overnight. I first noticed it maybe a week ago, but it wasn’t much. It's gotten worse each day, I’d say. I didn't pay too much mind at first, to be honest. Thought it was just…tiredness. But it’s definitely not getting better on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over the past week, worsening each day. That’s important. And you mentioned this in relation to the atrial fibrillation you were previously diagnosed with. Do you currently take any medications for that, Nixon?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. Um… let me think. It’s a small white pill, and I take one every morning. I… I don’t know the name, I’m afraid. My… my mum handles most of that. I just… take it with my breakfast. I’m very sorry, I’m not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nixon, don't worry about it at all. It's very common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in our system. Do you know who prescribed it to you, or perhaps the hospital or clinic where you received the diagnosis?
PATIENT: I believe it was… Dr. MacIntyre, at the hospital in Inverness. That’s… up north, where I’m from. It was a few years ago now. I had some tests, and then he put me on the pill. He warned me about feeling… a bit unsteady sometimes, and told me to watch for any bleeding. But mostly, it's been fine. Until this leg, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. MacIntyre at the hospital in Inverness, diagnosed a few years ago and prescribed a medication for atrial fibrillation. He mentioned watching for bleeding and feeling unsteady. Good. We'll certainly look into that record. Now, aside from the swelling and the atrial fibrillation, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a bit tired, as I said, but that’s not unusual for me. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… not any more than usual, anyway. My breathing is a little quicker than normal, maybe. But I'm also a bit anxious about my leg, so that could be why. I haven't been eating very well, either, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, no chest pain or shortness of breath, some anxiety, and you haven't been eating well. It's good you're aware of these things. Not eating well can certainly contribute to fatigue. Now, Nixon, to help me understand if anything specific might have triggered this, have you had any recent injuries to your leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I haven’t bumped it or anything. I walk to university most days, and I haven’t tripped or fallen. I do a little bit of gardening, but nothing strenuous. I’m very careful, you see. I try not to overdo it. I can't say for sure, but I think it started after I spent a long time standing at a concert last weekend. But I didn’t notice anything then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent injuries, and potentially started after standing for a long time at a concert last weekend. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your leg, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heartbeat and check the swelling, temperature, and pulses in your leg. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please do. I would like to know what is going on. I'm a bit worried, to be honest. It’s just… unsettling, seeing my leg like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. We’ll take a look. It’s good you’re letting me know how you’re feeling. We’ll do our best to figure this out. First, I'm going to listen to your heart. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay. Your heart rate is a little fast and irregular, which is consistent with your history of atrial fibrillation. Alright, now I'm going to feel your leg. I notice some warmth and tenderness to the touch, and definitely some swelling compared to your other leg. There’s a significant difference in circumference between your left and right leg. I also feel a diminished pulse in your left foot compared to your right. I do observe some redness and mild discoloration in your lower left leg. Based on my examination, it appears you have significant swelling and inflammation in your left leg, with some signs that suggest possible reduced blood flow. These findings, combined with your history of atrial fibrillation, are concerning for a possible deep vein thrombosis, or DVT.
PATIENT: A… DVT? Is that bad, Doctor? It sounds very serious. Is that why my leg is swollen? And… what does that mean about my heartbeat? Should I be… worried? I haven’t felt any chest pain, like you asked before, but… oh dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, it’s understandable you’re worried. A DVT, or deep vein thrombosis, means there's a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in your leg. It can be serious, as the clot can travel to your lungs, which is called a pulmonary embolism, and that is a medical emergency. Now, the swelling in your leg is certainly consistent with a DVT. Your irregular heartbeat, the atrial fibrillation, increases your risk of forming blood clots. They aren’t directly causing each other in this moment, but one increases the likelihood of the other. The fact you haven’t experienced chest pain doesn’t rule it out, as some people don’t have any symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, we need to do some further testing. I would like to order a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. This test uses sound waves to visualize the veins and check for blood clots. We also need to check your D-dimer levels with a blood test. This test measures a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. Until we have the results, I'm going to recommend starting you on a blood thinner immediately, as a precaution. This will help prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A blood thinner? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. Will it make me bleed easily? And what kind of test is a Doppler ultrasound? Is it painful? I… I don't think I understand everything you’re saying. I’m getting very worried now. Would it be alright if my mum came in? She's very good at understanding these things.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable you’re worried, Nixon. It’s a lot to take in, and it’s good you're asking questions. Yes, a blood thinner, or anticoagulant, does increase your risk of bleeding. However, we would start you on a low dose, and we would monitor you closely. We'd also give you instructions on what to watch out for, like excessive bruising or bleeding from cuts. A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test – it doesn't involve needles or anything like that. A technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a small device over your veins. It uses sound waves to create an image of your veins on a screen. It’s generally painless, though you might feel some pressure. And absolutely, it's perfectly alright if your mum comes in. Having someone with you can be very helpful. Please ask her any questions she might have as well. Let me call the front desk and see if she’s here. She's just in the waiting room. I’ll have her come back. In the meantime, I'm going to write up the orders for the D-dimer test, the Doppler ultrasound, and the blood thinner. We’ll get the ball rolling as quickly as possible. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None at all. And… thank you for explaining everything. I feel a little bit better, knowing what’s happening. It’s just… scary. My mum will be here any minute, I think. She's very good at keeping me calm. And… is there anything I shouldn't be doing, while we wait for the tests? Should I be resting my leg?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It’s good to hear you’re feeling a little better. And it's good your mum is on her way – having support is important. While we wait for the test results, I recommend resting your leg as much as possible and elevating it when you're sitting or lying down. Avoid any strenuous activity. Try not to cross your legs, as that can also impede blood flow. And if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or increased pain or swelling in your leg, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, or have someone take you. Ah, here's your mum now. Please, both of you, feel free to ask any questions you have. We’ll get through this together.
