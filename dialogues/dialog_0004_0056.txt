DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s…difficult to explain. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It’s the university, you see. The students. They simply don’t appreciate the value of a properly cataloged Dewey Decimal system anymore. It’s…exhausting. Though, to be frank, I'm not entirely sure why I'm telling you this.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be frustrating, Mr. Schlatterer. However, my concern is your health. While I appreciate your dedication to the university library, could you perhaps tell me what specific medical issue prompted you to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Medical issue? Oh. Right. Yes. Well, my…colleague, Mrs. Henderson, she insisted. Said I was looking “peaked.” Honestly, the woman always exaggerates. It’s just…a general feeling of being…overwhelmed, I suppose. Tired. And frankly, quite irritated. Is that something you treat? Because if not…
DOCTOR: “Overwhelmed,” “tired,” and “irritated” are certainly things we can explore, Mr. Schlatterer. Those can be symptoms of many things. To help me understand what's going on, let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling unusually fatigued?
PATIENT: Fatigued? Oh, for decades, I assure you. Since… well, since I began teaching these…unmotivated students. It’s a constant battle against…mediocrity. But, if you must have a specific timeframe… perhaps the last academic year was particularly… draining. Though, honestly, they all blur together after a while. Is this going anywhere? I have a rather important manuscript to review, you see.
DOCTOR: So, increased fatigue for roughly the past academic year. Has this fatigue been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, naturally. Though, there are…lulls. When the semester ends, for example. A brief respite from the… intellectual chaos. But it always returns. Like a particularly persistent weed. And, frankly, I haven't the energy to constantly explain this to…people. Is there a quicker way to resolve this? Perhaps a simple prescription?
DOCTOR: While a “quick fix” is sometimes possible, it’s important to understand why you’re feeling this way, Mr. Schlatterer. Besides fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my patience has…diminished. Considerably. And I find myself… less tolerant of incompetence. Is that a medical symptom? Because if it is, I daresay half the population suffers from it. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. I’m a highly educated man, perfectly capable of…managing my own…discomfort.
DOCTOR: Decreased patience and intolerance… Those can be associated with several things. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Appetite? What a peculiar question. I eat when I am hungry, naturally. Though, to be frank, I’ve little time for elaborate meals. A quick sandwich, perhaps a piece of fruit. Weight? I haven’t stepped on a scale in… decades. It’s irrelevant. I’m perfectly… functional. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because I must confess, I find this entire exercise… rather unproductive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, these questions are important. Have you noticed any difficulty sleeping, or perhaps any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Now see here! Are you attempting to… psychoanalyze me? I came here because a meddling colleague insisted I was looking “peaked,” not to be subjected to a… a grilling! I assure you, my personal habits are none of your concern. Frankly, I find this entire conversation… insulting. I believe I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, please. I understand you're frustrated, but dismissing these questions won’t help me understand what’s going on. Given your age, and the changes you have mentioned, it's important to rule out several possibilities. I’m concerned about potential underlying medical issues. Before you leave, allow me to at least take some basic vital signs—blood pressure, pulse—and listen to your heart and lungs. It will take just a few minutes. If you refuse, I will document that in your chart, and I will strongly recommend you see a specialist for a more thorough evaluation.
