DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My back… it is not so good lately. It hurts when I stand for long time, you see. I work with cars… bending, lifting… it is hard now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you’ve been here before, a few times for this. Telehealth is fine, but sometimes with back pain it's better to have a hands-on exam. But we can certainly try to figure things out here. So, this pain… how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, you know? For maybe… six months now? It is worse when I am busy at the shop. Sometimes I wake up with it, sometimes not. It is… difficult to say exactly. I take some pills… the white ones… but they don’t always help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent for six months. And you said 'white pills'… do you know the name of those?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. My husband, he always got the medicine for me. After he… passed… I just keep taking the ones that look the same. They are small, white… round. I do not know the name, I am sorry. I have Medicare… does that help you find it?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s not worry about it right now. Medicare can help. It looks like you were prescribed Naproxen 500mg a few months back. Is that the one?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yes! That is it. The little white pills. Yes, thank you, Doctor. I forget so many things these days. I take two, maybe three, when it hurts bad. Is that… too much? I do not want to cause problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Naproxen is an anti-inflammatory, and it can help, but taking more than the prescribed dose can cause problems – stomach upset, even kidney issues if you take too much for too long. Two pills at a time is usually enough. How often are you taking three pills?
PATIENT: Oh… I do not take them every day. Only when I have a busy day at the shop, or if I lift something heavy. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes less. I try not to, but… the pain, you see? It makes it hard to work. I need to work. I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: I understand needing to work. Okay, so intermittent use, a few times a week when the pain is bad. Let’s talk about the pain itself. Where exactly on your back does it hurt?
PATIENT: It is… low down. Not high up, like between my shoulders. It is… in the small of my back, you know? And sometimes… it goes down my leg. Not all the way, but down the back of my thigh. It is… a dull ache, usually. But when I move wrong… it is sharp. Like someone is sticking me with a needle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so low back pain, radiating down the back of your thigh. That suggests it might be affecting a nerve. Does the pain get worse with specific movements?
PATIENT: Yes! When I bend over… it is terrible. And when I twist… to look under the car, or reach for a tool… oh, it is very bad. I have to be very careful. I try to ask someone to help, but… sometimes I need to do it myself. It is a busy shop, you see. I can not always wait for help.
DOCTOR: Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes… yes. In my left foot, mostly. It feels… like pins and needles. Not all the time, but when I stand for a long time. Or after I have been working hard. It goes away when I sit down and rest. But it is… worrying. It makes me afraid I will fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in your left foot, with prolonged standing. That's definitely something we need to pay attention to. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really. But… sometimes my left leg feels heavy. Like it is harder to lift it. I thought it was just from being tired. I work very hard, you see. Long days. But maybe… maybe it is more than that. I do not know. I am getting old, Doctor. Things just… hurt.
DOCTOR: It's not just about getting old, Ms. Benites. It's important to figure out what's going on. I think we need to be a little more thorough. I'd like to do a few simple tests, if you don't mind, to check your reflexes and strength. It won't take long. Can you describe how you feel when you wake up in the morning?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. I want to feel better. In the morning… well, I am stiff. Very stiff. It takes me a long time to get moving. And my back… it hurts the most then. It is… hard to get out of bed. I have to take my time. Very slowly. It loosens up a little after I have been up for a while, but… it is never really good.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning stiffness is important to know. Now, can you lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I hope I am not too much trouble. This old body is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Benites, I'm just going to check how easily you can lift your legs. It's alright if it hurts, just let me know. Alright, and now can you bend forward and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… that is not so good. It hurts in my back. And my left leg… it feels tight. Oh… no. I can’t get much further. It hurts too much. I am afraid I will pull something. This old body… it does not bend so easily anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough. You don’t need to push yourself. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it seems like you have a lower back problem, likely involving some nerve compression, possibly sciatica. The numbness and tingling in your leg, and the pain radiating down your thigh, point to that. It's also possible there's some muscle strain involved. We need to rule out anything more serious, though. I'm going to order an X-ray of your lower back to check for any structural issues. And I'd like you to get an MRI to get a better look at the nerves and soft tissues.
PATIENT: An X-ray and an MRI… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it something very bad, Doctor? I just want to be able to work. I need to work. And I am afraid of falling. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Some medicine… or something to help the pain? I am very worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’re getting these tests done, Ms. Benites, and it doesn’t necessarily mean it's something very bad. It’s just best to be thorough and rule things out. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, we can definitely manage the pain. I'm going to increase your Naproxen dosage slightly, but we need to be careful. We'll start with one pill three times a day, with food, to protect your stomach. And I'm going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help with the spasms. But please, be careful driving or operating machinery while you’re taking it. I'm also going to recommend physical therapy. A therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your posture. And it’s very important to avoid lifting anything heavy until we know what's going on. I'm writing up a referral for you now. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Thank you. One Naproxen three times a day… and the muscle relaxant. I will be very careful. No lifting… that will be hard, but I will try. Physical therapy… that sounds good. Maybe it will help. I am just very worried about falling. I live alone, you see. Is the muscle relaxant… very strong? Will it make me sleepy?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking ahead, Ms. Benites. The muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, can cause drowsiness, so you’ll want to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. It’s also important to start with a low dose and see how you feel. I’m prescribing a low dose to begin with. Because you live alone and are concerned about falling, I strongly recommend getting a walking aid – a cane or walker – just for extra support until we know more. I can write you a prescription for one, or you can get one over the counter. And please, make sure your home is clear of any tripping hazards – rugs, cords, anything that could cause you to stumble. Here are your prescriptions and the referral for physical therapy. The X-ray and MRI orders are already sent to the imaging center. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. Thank you very much. You have been very helpful. A cane… yes, that is a good idea. I will be careful. And I will try not to worry too much. I hope the tests do not take too long. I just want to get back to work. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I understand wanting to get back to work. We'll get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your pain gets worse. And please, be extra cautious. Take care, and I'll see you when you have the test results.
