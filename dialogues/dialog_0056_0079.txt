DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it's about my bruising. It's just... been worse lately. I'm on blood thinners, you see, and normally a little bump isn't a big deal, but this past week… it’s been different. Like, a normal knock and I look like I've been in a fight.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s significantly worse than usual, especially while on blood thinners, is definitely something we need to look into. Can you tell me a little more about these "normal knocks"?
PATIENT: Umm… okay. Well, I bumped my arm on the corner of the kitchen counter on Monday, just a little graze really. Usually, it's a tiny bit of color, gone in a few days. This time? It’s like… purple and swollen, and it’s still pretty bad. Then yesterday, I just… leaned against the doorframe and got a bruise on my hip. It doesn’t make any sense. I haven't fallen or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising with minimal trauma, and it’s happening in multiple locations. And it’s not resolving as quickly as it usually does. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I'm a little more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, who isn't tired these days? No fever, no dizziness, no bleeding gums or anything like that. Just… the bruises. And they worry me, because, you know, the blood thinners. I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially being on blood thinners. Fatigue can be a symptom of a lot of things, but we definitely want to rule out anything serious. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for years now. And that's it, honestly. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. Aside from the bruising, I feel okay. I eat alright, try to walk when I can... normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication. Good. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I'm not a fan, to be honest. Avoid them if I can. Just a few broken bones when I was a kid – a wrist, an ankle – but nothing serious. Nothing that would, like, affect this, I wouldn't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just a few childhood fractures. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mom had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my dad… he had heart problems when he got older. Nothing about bleeding disorders or anything like that, as far as I know. We weren't really a family that talked about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and heart problems. And you said you're taking medication for high blood pressure – what's the name of that medication, if you remember?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. I’ve been on it for… oh gosh, maybe eight years now? It’s the little white pill, I think. I get it refilled every month.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. But not regularly, just when I really need it. Maybe once or twice a week, tops.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings or anything. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would! Okay, good. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse, and then I'll take a look at the bruises. Can you roll up your sleeve and point to where you've been bruising the most?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. It's mostly here, on my arm, and over here on my hip. It's just… appearing so easily now. And it’s tender, even when I don’t touch it hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today. And yes, the bruising is quite significant. I'm also noting some tenderness to the touch. The size and location are… concerning enough to warrant some further investigation. Do you mind if I order some blood work?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Blood work is fine. Honestly, I just want to figure out what's going on. This is worrying me. I don’t like feeling like I’m going to fall apart just from bumping into things.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get some tests ordered to help us figure this out. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check your platelet count and look for any signs of anemia, as well as a coagulation panel to assess how well your blood is clotting. We'll also check your kidney function, just to be thorough. The lab will need a sample from your arm. It should only take a few minutes. After we get the results back, we'll discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough, which is good. Platelets, right? Those help with clotting? Is it possible the Lisinopril is doing something? I haven't changed anything else, so that’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Yes, platelets are essential for blood clotting. And you’re right to ask about the Lisinopril. While it's not a common side effect, some medications can affect platelet function or cause changes in clotting. It's definitely something we need to consider. We'll get those labs back and see what they tell us. In the meantime, I want you to be careful. Avoid any activities that could lead to injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any unusual bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds alright. Be careful, avoid injury, watch for bleeding. Got it. I'll definitely be careful. And I'll call if anything changes. How long will the lab results take? I’m kind of anxious about this.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. Our office will call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'll also write you a note excusing you from any strenuous activity at work, just to be on the safe side. Here's that note. Do you have any questions before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good, thank you. No, I think that’s everything. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It’s just… unsettling when your body starts doing things it shouldn’t. I’ll just wait for the call, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we are taking this seriously. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
