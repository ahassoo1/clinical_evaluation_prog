DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… about a surgery. I’m hoping to get cleared for it. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. We’ll take our time, and I'll do my best to help. It's common to feel a little unsure remembering details. Don’t worry about it at all. Perhaps we can start with what the surgery is for, if you recall that?
PATIENT: Yes… it’s… cosmetic. That’s what my… my husband and I discussed. Before… before he passed. It’s something I’ve wanted for a long time, I think. It has to do with… my face. Around my jawline, mostly. But the specifics… they’re rather hazy. I apologize. Is that… enough to start with?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, Mackenzi. “Cosmetic surgery, focusing on the jawline.” And I understand it was something you discussed with your husband. It’s completely alright that the details are unclear. We can certainly work around that. To help me understand your current situation a bit better, and to make sure you are a good candidate for surgery, could you tell me when you were hoping to have this surgery done?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when? That’s… difficult. I believe… soon? I was speaking with the surgeon, Doctor… Alvarez, I think his name was. He mentioned August… perhaps around now? Or very shortly after? I honestly can’t be certain. Everything feels… very close together in my mind, lately. It’s rather frustrating. I truly am sorry for the confusion.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mackenzi, truly. It's perfectly understandable. Memory issues can be very unsettling. “Planning surgery in August, potentially with Dr. Alvarez.” We’ll get to the bottom of it. Do you recall what specifically you were hoping to achieve with the surgery?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… about my profile. I always felt… unbalanced, somehow. My jawline isn’t… defined enough, I suppose. My husband, he always said I was beautiful just as I was, of course, but… I think he noticed it too. I wanted to feel… more confident. To look… more like myself, if that makes any sense. It’s a bit silly, perhaps. I just want to feel… more at peace with my appearance.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound silly at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel more confident and at peace with your appearance. Many people consider cosmetic surgery for those very reasons. "Patient desires improvement in jawline definition for enhanced self-confidence." Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, and to make sure surgery is safe for you, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… another difficult area. I try to remember, but… things are fragmented. I believe I’m generally healthy. I haven’t been to the doctor much in the last few years. Before… everything… I had the usual checkups. I don’t recall any major illnesses or surgeries, but… I do take a medication for my blood pressure. A small dose, prescribed by my family doctor. But the name… escapes me. I apologize. It's on the list my insurance provided, I'm sure. Perhaps this will help?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Don’t worry about it at all. We can look through your list. Your insurance list will be very helpful. Let's start with that. Ah, here we are. “Lisinopril, 10mg daily.” Good. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, such as food or latex?
PATIENT: Lisinopril, yes! That’s it. Thank you, Doctor. And… allergies? Let me see… No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. No food allergies. And I’ve never had an issue with latex, to my knowledge. My husband was the one with the… sensitivities, not me. He was allergic to bees, quite severely. But I… no, I don’t have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. And… a wisdom tooth pulled, of course. But that doesn’t count as a surgery, does it? No… I don’t believe I’ve had any other surgeries. Not as an adult. Definitely nothing major. Should there be something I’m forgetting? It’s just… things are so hazy.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. Tonsils and wisdom teeth don’t count as major surgeries. And it’s good that you haven’t had any others that you recall. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had heart problems, later in life. High blood pressure, I think. And my father… he was a very healthy man, for the most part. He lived to a good age. But… I don’t recall any other major illnesses in my immediate family. My siblings are both healthy as well, as far as I know. I haven’t seen them in a while, truthfully. It's all rather… vague. I apologize for not being more helpful, Doctor. It’s just… my memory is such a… mess.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. You’re doing just fine. We’ll work with what we have. "Mother had history of heart problems and hypertension." Now, to get a full picture, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. But that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. My husband… he enjoyed a good brandy now and then, but I never touched the stuff myself. I’ve always been very careful about my health. That’s one thing I do remember clearly, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mackenzi. “Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption.” Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your overall health and make sure you are a good candidate for surgery. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a look at your jawline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand it's important to be thorough. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgment completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning. I'll listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, examining your jawline… There’s some mild laxity of the skin, consistent with your concerns. Bone structure appears normal. No tenderness to palpation. Overall, you appear to be in good health. The elevated blood pressure is something we may want to address before surgery, but it's not an immediate contraindication.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I have been a bit stressed lately, I suppose. It's been a difficult year. The blood pressure… I’ll try to keep an eye on it. So… what does this mean? Am I… cleared for surgery? Or do I need to do more tests? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mackenzi. It’s good to be informed. Based on my initial assessment, you are a reasonable candidate for surgery. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and to ensure the best possible outcome, I’d like to order some routine blood work. Just a standard CBC and a metabolic panel. It will give us a better baseline of your overall health. We’ll also need an EKG to rule out any underlying heart issues. And, depending on the surgeon you are working with, they may want their own medical imaging. Do you know who your surgeon is?
PATIENT: Doctor… Alvarez, I believe. Yes, that was his name. He had a practice… downtown, I think? Near the hospital. It was… quite a while ago that I spoke with him. Perhaps I should contact him to confirm. I honestly can’t remember all the details. It’s just… a blur. I apologize. I wish my memory was better. I feel so… helpless sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're not helpless at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable to be forgetful. Let's jot down Dr. Alvarez’s name and practice location. I can help you look up his contact information if you’d like. And we'll proceed at your pace. In the meantime, I’ll order the blood work and EKG. We can schedule those for you at the lab down the hall. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and, if everything looks good, get a referral for you to Dr. Alvarez. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding. You've been so kind. To have someone help me sort through all of this… it means a great deal. Yes, please, if you could help me find his contact information, that would be incredible. And scheduling the tests… that would be a huge weight off my shoulders. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. That’s what I’m here for. Here you are. Dr. Alvarez’s office is right here. And I’ll have the lab slip ready for you shortly. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been so helpful. I… I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what the next steps are. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. I’ll see you when the test results are in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
