DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. My husband... he make appointment. Something about... learning? I forget already. Is hot in here.
DOCTOR: Learning?
PATIENT: Yes. He say... patient... education. Something like that. I no understand what that mean exactly. Is about my... body? He worry too much, my husband. Always worry.
DOCTOR: Patient education simply means we're going to discuss your health concerns and how to best take care of yourself. It sounds like your husband is concerned about something specific. Perhaps you could tell me what you feel is going on, or what he’s worried about?
PATIENT: I... I work with metal. Sheet metal. Very hard work. Sometimes my back hurt. But is normal, right? All the bending and lifting... I take pain pills sometimes. The red ones. He does not like that. He say... bad for liver? I don't know. Everything is bad for you these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain related to your work. And you’re taking… red pills for it. Do you know the name of these red pills, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Um... no. I just... take them when it hurt too much. My coworker, Lin, she give me. She say they good. Strong. I think... maybe Vicodin? Or something like that. Is small red pills. I no remember the writing on the bottle. I throw bottle away.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, taking medication you didn’t get from a doctor, and discarding the packaging… that’s not ideal, Ms. Fontanazza. We need to know exactly what you've been taking. Do you know how often you’ve been taking these pills?
PATIENT: Uh... when my back really, really hurt. Maybe... three, four times last month? Is hard to remember. Work is busy. I no keep track. He yell at me about it sometimes. Say I no take care of myself. He always right, my husband.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the back pain and these pills, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else...? Hmm... I get tired. Very tired. Even after sleep. But I always tired. Work hard, you know? And sometimes... my stomach feel funny. Like... burning. But is probably the spicy food I like. Is good food! He no like it so spicy. He say it bad for stomach.
DOCTOR: Burning in your stomach... Okay. We need to get a better understanding of what's going on. Let's start with a physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay... struggles slightly to stand Is okay... my legs a little weak. The work... very tiring, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. It does seem tender there. And I notice some… mild swelling. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: winces slightly as she bends forward, reaching only about halfway Ouch! Is hurting! Is always hurting when I bend. See? I told you. Metal work is no easy. Is very hard on body. Can I sit down now?
DOCTOR: Yes, sit down. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit… rapid. Lungs are clear. Let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Hmm... I no think so. I eat everything. Spicy food, sweets, fish... everything. I never had problem. Lin say I have strong stomach. But... maybe I get rash one time? Years ago. From something. I forget what. Is not important. The rash gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications, besides these red pills from your coworker?
PATIENT: Um... I take a little... herb tea. For sleep. My mother send it from China. She say is good for everything. Make you calm, make you sleep good. Is small bag, brown bag. I drink before bed. Sometimes. Not every night. Is... relaxing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. So, we have back pain, potentially Vicodin use, fatigue, stomach issues, an herbal tea, and a possible rash in the past. Given your work, the medications, and your symptoms, I'm concerned about a few things. I'd like to order some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count. We also need to rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue and stomach discomfort. It is very important that you tell me the truth about all medications you're taking, even the ones you get from friends or family. Do you understand?
PATIENT: fidgets with her hands Okay... okay. Blood work... is okay. But… will it hurt? My husband always say doctors just want to poke and prod. And... I told you everything I remember. Honestly. I no want trouble. Is just... hard to remember everything, you know? I work very hard. And my husband... he worry too much. But yes. I understand. Tell you everything. If I remember.
DOCTOR: The blood work involves a simple needle prick, a little discomfort, that's all. And I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Fontanazza. To clarify, your husband made the appointment, and he seems concerned about your health. He will be notified about our findings. I'm going to write a lab order for you. Please take this to the lab downstairs. I will need the results within 24 hours. In the meantime, please do not take any more of those red pills. Do you have any questions for me?
