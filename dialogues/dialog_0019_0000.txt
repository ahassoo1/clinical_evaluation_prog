DOCTOR: Well hello there, Sharifa. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit ridiculous, but my legs just feel…like jelly. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not that colds mean anything these days, everyone gets them. But still, now I can barely walk without feeling like I’m going to fall. It's very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right, jelly legs… and it started shortly after a cold. Okay. That is inconvenient, I can imagine. Just to be clear, when you say “a few days ago”, about how many days are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it was Tuesday I think when I really noticed it. So…four days? Yes, four days, as of today. Though it was subtle at first, you understand. I didn’t immediately think it was something. It just…gradually got worse. I really don't appreciate this, honestly. It’s thrown my entire schedule off.
DOCTOR: Four days… okay. And you said it started subtly and gradually worsened. Can you describe what you mean by "jelly legs"?
PATIENT: Well, it's exactly what it sounds like! They just…don't feel stable. Like they're going to buckle under me. It's not painful, exactly, though sometimes there’s a bit of a…twinge. It's more like a weakness, a complete lack of…power. And it's both legs, which is what’s so concerning, really. It's not like I tripped or pulled a muscle. It just…happened. And I've never experienced anything like it before. Honestly, young people these days don't understand how much things fall apart as you get older.
DOCTOR: Right, both legs, weakness, not painful but a bit of a twinge… and it came on after the cold. I understand your concern, Sharifa. It’s good you're bringing this to our attention. Now, aside from the weakness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Honestly, Doctor, what exactly do you mean? I'm trying to tell you my legs feel like they're going to give out! But…let me think. My feet feel a little…numb sometimes. Not constantly, just on and off. And I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but truthfully, who isn't? I work very hard, always on my feet leading tours. It’s not like I’m lounging around all day. Though some people seem to think that’s what tour guides do. Preposterous.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your feet on and off, and increased fatigue. You mentioned you lead tours…do you do a lot of walking as part of that job?
PATIENT: Do I do a lot of walking? Doctor, it is my job! I’m a tour guide, aren’t I? I walk miles every day, showing people the historical sites, explaining the culture…it’s physically demanding work, you know. And I'm always on my feet for hours, making sure everything goes smoothly. It requires a certain level of…expertise, if I may say so myself. Not everyone can do it. I'm quite good at it, really. But now, with these legs…it’s becoming…difficult. And frankly, quite embarrassing. I don’t want to cancel tours, but I also don’t want anyone to think I’m…incapable.
DOCTOR: Right, physically demanding work, miles of walking… I understand. And you’re concerned about being able to continue your tours. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history. Well, I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication. Nothing major, you understand. And I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, but that was decades ago. Honestly, I don’t really see what any of that has to do with my legs feeling like jelly. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, despite everything. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. Who doesn’t? I’m not one of those people who lives on rabbit food. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Are you going to actually help me, or just ask me about my life story?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions, Sharifa. It’s just important to get a complete picture. We're trying to figure out what might be causing this. Okay, high blood pressure under control, hysterectomy in the past… Now, do you take any medications regularly, besides the one for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, let me think. I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it because I don’t get enough sun. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing fancy. And…oh! I occasionally take something for my heartburn, but it’s just when I eat something spicy. I do enjoy a good Latin American meal, you see. But honestly, that’s it. A vitamin, some ibuprofen when needed, and something for heartburn. It’s not like I’m on a cocktail of medications, unlike some people I know. It’s all very sensible, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and something for heartburn. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with pollen, but that's hardly an allergy. And I can’t eat shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. It’s…unpleasant, you see. I had a bad experience with it when I was a child, so I just avoid it altogether. But no serious allergies to medications or anything else. Honestly, I'm a fairly robust person. It’s just these legs…they’re really bothering me. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? I have a tour tomorrow, and I really need to know if I’ll be able to lead it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, finally! Something actually doing something. Yes, of course, Doctor. Just…please be gentle. I don’t want to fall over while you’re poking and prodding. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be, you know. Honestly, I hope you find something. It’s just these legs…they feel so useless. But please, be careful. And try not to take too long, I really need to know what’s going on. And don't make me lie on one of those paper tables if you can help it. They’re dreadfully uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll take things slowly and gently. And no paper tables, I promise. We'll do everything while you're seated. First, let's check your reflexes. Just relax your legs... Good. Now I'm going to tap a little hammer on your knees and ankles. This is perfectly normal. Okay, reflexes are good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Squeeze your hands. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like I’m back in school. Always being poked and prodded. But alright, here we go. There. Is that alright? It’s…a little difficult, actually. My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be. But I’m trying. Honestly, this is rather undignified. But fine, I squeezed. What’s the verdict? Do I have some horrible disease? I have a tour tomorrow, you know. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, good strength, though you mention some effort. Now, I’m going to touch different parts of your legs and feet with this. Just tell me if you can feel that. We're checking sensation. Okay, sensation appears intact. Everything feels normal to me. Now, just to be thorough, can you stand up for a moment, if you're able, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Stand up and walk a few steps. Honestly, I feel like a lab rat. But fine, here we go. There. Is that alright? It’s…not easy, actually. I’m a bit wobbly, and my legs feel…weak, even with the sensation being fine. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. I'm normally much steadier on my feet. This is very concerning. Do you see anything wrong? What's going on with my legs? I really need to know if I can lead my tour tomorrow. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see what you mean. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and you do appear a bit weak. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I've observed during the exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be several things, ranging from a lingering effect of the cold to a possible vitamin deficiency or even something related to your arthritis. Since your symptoms are new and are impacting your ability to walk, I want to be cautious. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and rule out any other underlying causes. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist to further evaluate your leg weakness and rule out any nerve-related issues. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and a neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather alarming. I just wanted to know why my legs feel like jelly, not undergo a battery of tests and specialist visits! But…I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I just don't want to be poked and prodded endlessly. And frankly, I’m concerned about the cost. Medicare covers some things, but… Alright, fine. Blood tests and a neurologist. But please, can we expedite this? I really need to know what’s going on before my tour tomorrow. And can you explain what this neurologist will actually do? I don’t want to be subjected to any painful procedures. Honestly, this is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. We’ll do everything we can to expedite the process. I'll send the blood test order to the lab right away, and they should be able to schedule you as soon as possible. I'll also write a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a neurologist I trust. Dr. Ramirez will likely start with a detailed neurological exam, checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and sensation again, similar to what I did, but more extensively. She may also order an MRI or nerve conduction studies to get a clearer picture of what's going on. These tests are generally painless, though the MRI can be a bit noisy. As for the cost, we'll submit everything to Medicare. If there are any out-of-pocket expenses, our billing department can help you with payment options. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy and avoiding any strenuous activity. And if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call us or go to the emergency room. Here are the blood test order and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood tests, neurologist… It's just a lot. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just…try to get this done quickly, please? And make sure Dr. Ramirez is gentle. I really need to know if I can lead my tour tomorrow. Honestly, it's very inconvenient to be canceling tours. I have a reputation to uphold. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll call and schedule the tests and the neurologist. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Sharifa. We'll do our best. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
