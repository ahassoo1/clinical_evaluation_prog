DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it’s a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants... she thinks about having a baby. And she said I should come talk to someone first? Something about making sure everything is okay… before? I forget the exact words. It’s about… before a baby comes, yes?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verrall. It sounds like your daughter is considering starting a family, and she's understandably wanting to ensure everything is healthy beforehand. That’s very thoughtful of both of you. We call this preconception counseling – discussing health factors before a pregnancy. To best assist, I’d like to gather some information about your medical history and current health status. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Medical… history. Hmm. It’s been a long time since I thought about that. I worked… sales, mostly. Traveling a lot. Not much time for doctors. I remember… a broken arm when I was young. And maybe some bad flu a few times. But nothing serious, I don’t think. I’m… okay now. Mostly. Do you need… dates? I’m terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: Dates aren't critical at this stage, Mr. Verrall. Just a general overview is helpful. We can always refine details later if needed. You mentioned a broken arm and some flu illnesses. Were those illnesses recent, or a long time ago?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time ago. The arm… when I was maybe eight? Nine? The flu… hard to say. Many years back. I haven’t been really sick sick in… well, decades. I get a little tired sometimes, but everyone does, right? My daughter worries too much. She’s a good girl, though. Very good. Does it matter if I travel a lot? I used to go to… lots of places. Europe, mostly. Asia sometimes.
DOCTOR: Traveling can be relevant, yes. Certain regions have different health risks, and it's good to be aware of potential exposures. Do you recall if you received any vaccinations while traveling, or have you had a tetanus booster in the last ten years?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… hmm. I think… maybe? When I was younger, I had some shots before a trip to… India, I think. A long time ago. I don’t remember the details. Tetanus… that’s the one for… rusty metal? I haven’t cut myself on anything rusty for a very long time. I really don't remember if I had a booster. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Is it important? Should I have gotten one?
DOCTOR: It is important to ensure your tetanus protection is up-to-date, Mr. Verrall. It's a routine booster that’s recommended every ten years. Since you're unsure of your last booster, we can consider giving you one today as a precaution. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not really. Sometimes I take… something for my stomach. It’s just when it hurts. Over-the-counter, you said? Yes, that’s it. Little white pills. I can’t remember the name. And no… herbal things. I don’t really believe in those. Just the stomach pills, sometimes. And… maybe a pain reliever if my back hurts. But not often. I try to avoid those.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, such as pollen or insect stings?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten… everything, mostly. No problems. I get a little… sniffly sometimes in the spring, with the flowers, but I thought that was just the season. Nothing serious. No rashes, no trouble breathing. My daughter is very careful about what she eats, but I’m not like that. I eat… whatever tastes good. Is that bad? I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Verrall. That’s perfectly fine. It's good to know you haven't experienced any significant allergic reactions. Now, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's a difficult one. My father… he had… heart problems, I think. Died when I was young. And my mother… she had… I don't remember. Old age, mostly. She lived a long life. I had a brother, but he doesn't talk to the family anymore. I don't know about his health. It’s… not a very close family. Is it important to know all of this? I don’t know much to tell you, really. Just… old age and heart trouble, mostly.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Verrall. Knowing about heart trouble in the family is particularly relevant. Even a general idea is useful. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. My father smoked, and it… didn't do him any good. Alcohol… sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. Not very often. And definitely no… other things. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I like good food, good company, and… traveling, when I can. I try to stay active, but… getting older is hard. I walk a lot, though. When the weather is nice. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That sounds quite reasonable, Mr. Verrall. Walking is excellent exercise. Finally, before we proceed, could you tell me your height and weight, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I’m… not very tall. Maybe… one hundred and sixty-eight centimeters? Something like that. And… weight? I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I suppose around… one hundred and forty-one kilograms? It’s been a few years. Don’t judge me, Doctor. I like my food. It's hard to resist. And I’m a bit… bigger than I used to be, yes. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. I'm not here to judge, just to gather information. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, to summarize, you have a history of a broken arm and some flu illnesses in the past, occasional use of over-the-counter stomach medication and pain relievers, no known allergies, a family history of heart trouble, and a lifestyle that includes moderate wine consumption and regular walking. Given your daughter's plans, and considering your medical history, I would like to perform a brief physical exam and order some routine blood work to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. A check-up is a good idea. I suppose. I haven't had one in… a long time. Blood work… is it painful? I don't like needles very much. But if it's important for my daughter… then I'll do it. Just… please be quick? And gentle, if possible. I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a good man.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Verrall, and I assure you we’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It's just a small sample, and the discomfort is minimal. First, let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can proceed with the blood draw. Your blood pressure is 145/90. That’s slightly elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, we’ll just need a small amount of blood for a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a lipid panel. I'll have the nurse draw that for you now.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That didn't hurt too bad. Just… a bit cold. The nurse is very nice, though. So, what will the blood tell you? Will it show if I'm healthy enough for my daughter to… you know? I worry about her. She wants this baby so much. I just want to make sure everything is alright. Before… before it happens. And… is there anything I need to do? Anything I need to change? I like my food, Doctor. You know? But… I'll try. If it helps my daughter.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Verrall. You did very well. The blood work will give us a good overview of your kidney and liver function, your blood sugar levels, your cholesterol, and your overall health status. It will help us identify any potential concerns that might need to be addressed before your daughter begins trying to conceive. Regarding changes, let’s wait for the results first. However, it’s always a good idea to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Even small changes can make a difference. We can discuss a balanced diet and exercise plan once we have the results. In the meantime, please continue to take your stomach medication as needed. And if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. The nurse will contact you once they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. And you're very kind. Thank you for listening to an old man ramble on. I worry so much about my daughter. But she's a good girl. She deserves… a happy life. I just want to help, if I can. I’ll wait for the nurse to call. And I’ll try… to eat a little healthier. Maybe. Thank you again, Doctor Neppl. .
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Verrall. I understand your concern for your daughter, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions or concerns arise before the nurse contacts you. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
