DOCTOR: Hi, Mr. Trendler. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, good to meet you too, I suppose. Look, I don't have all day. It's about… well, it's about this. <gestures vaguely at own body> I ain’t happy with how things are lookin’. Not happy at all. Used to be strong, you know? Pile drivin’ ain’t easy work. Now… now it’s just…saggin’. And weak. Want somethin’ done about it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re feeling weaker than you used to and noticing some changes in your body. It sounds frustrating when you've been used to being strong. To help me figure out what’s going on, could you tell me a little more specifically what you mean by “saggin’”?
PATIENT: "Saggin’"? What do you mean what do I mean? Use your head, girl. Everything’s droopin’. My stomach, my arms… even my face feels like it's fallin’ apart! It ain’t a mystery. I’m losin’ muscle, and it’s lookin’ terrible. I want it fixed. Is that clear enough for you? I don't have time for games.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I apologize if my question was unclear. You're experiencing a loss of muscle mass and noticing it in your stomach, arms, and even your face. That definitely sounds concerning, and I appreciate you being direct about wanting to get to the bottom of this. To start, have you noticed this change happening gradually over time, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually! What kinda question is that? It didn't just poof happen overnight. It’s been months, maybe a year. Slow and steady…and annoyin’. Pile drivin’ used to keep me fit. Now… well, now I just feel old. And I don’t like it. Are we gettin’ anywhere, or are you just gonna keep askin’ silly questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, months to a year of gradual muscle loss. I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, and we want to figure out what's happening. Aside from the muscle loss, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmmm… well, I get tired easier. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I gotta stop and rest. And my bones… they ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. And I ain’t as strong as I used to be, obviously. Is that what you wanted to know? I’m tellin’ you everything! Just fix it, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, bone aches, and decreased strength. Thank you. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Not much, thankfully. Had the flu a few times, bad back once when I was younger from liftin’ too much… but nothin’ serious. Doc always said I was a strong, healthy man. 'Til now, that is. Private insurance, good coverage. Don’t waste my time with questions about silly things. I need somethin’ done. What kinda tests are you thinkin’?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you generally have been healthy. We're going to do a physical exam and some blood work to get a better idea of what’s going on. First, let me check your weight, blood pressure, and pulse. Then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. I got things to do. Don’t take all day weighin’ me. I know I lost weight, I can feel it. Just get on with it, Doctor. And be quick about it. I’m not a fan of doctors, you know. Waste of time, most of ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, your weight is 122 pounds, blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72. That's within a normal range for your age, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Squeeze your hands. <extends hands, squeezes firmly> There. Happy now? Used to have a stronger grip, you know. Everything’s weaker these days. Just tell me what’s wrong with me, Doctor. Don't need a whole lotta fancy tests, just fix it. What's the matter? Is it somethin’ serious? I don't wanna be stuck in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: Your grip is a bit weaker than expected, Mr. Trendler. Now, can you close your eyes and follow my finger as I move it?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? <closes eyes> Fine. Just don't wave it around too much. I get dizzy easy these days. <tracks finger with eyes, slowly> Is that good enough? Hurry it up, I ain’t got all day. This is ridiculous. I'm a strong man, I don't need no eye tests. Just tell me what's wrong and fix it.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are normal, and you're tracking my finger without any difficulty. Your reflexes are a little diminished. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam I've done, it sounds like you’re experiencing some muscle loss, fatigue, and bone aches. The diminished reflexes are also something to note. Several things could be causing this. It could be related to your diet, a vitamin deficiency, or something more serious like sarcopenia, which is age-related muscle loss, or even early signs of a neurological condition. To get a clearer picture, I want to order some blood work. This will help us check your vitamin levels, kidney function, thyroid levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sarcopenia? Neurological... what now? Look, I ain't a doctor. Just tell me in plain English. And don’t start throwin’ fancy words at me. Blood work? Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. But I ain’t happy about it. I just want to feel strong again. Is that too much to ask? And how long is this gonna take? I got a dinner appointment. And tell me, is this somethin’ serious? Be honest with me. I don't want any sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask for plain English, Mr. Trendler. Sarcopenia simply means losing muscle as you get older—it's common, but we want to rule it out or manage it. And a neurological condition could mean something is affecting your nerves or muscles. It's unlikely to be serious, but we need the blood work to be sure. The blood work will take a few days to come back. While we're waiting, I’m going to order a Vitamin D level, a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. In the meantime, are you able to tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Typical diet? Humph. I eat what my daughter cooks for me, mostly. She tries to get me to eat healthy, but I like my jerk chicken and rice and peas. I drink a little rum sometimes, not too much. Used to eat more fish when I was still workin’, but not so much now. She brings over a nice soup sometimes, too. I don’t cook for myself anymore. Too much trouble. And I don't take no fancy vitamins, just what she gives me when she remembers. Is that what you wanted to know? Simple food, simple life. Now, when can I get the results? Don't tell me a week. I ain't got a week to waste.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet of jerk chicken, rice and peas, some fish and soup, with some rum occasionally. It's good your daughter is looking out for you. The blood work should be back in 3-5 business days. We'll call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like increased weakness, dizziness, or trouble walking—please call the office immediately. Here’s a lab requisition. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Hmph. Three to five days. Alright. <takes the requisition> No, I don’t think so. Just… fix me. That’s all I want. I ain’t happy bein’ weak. Tell your staff to be quick about it, alright? And don’t waste my time with silly questions when I come back. I got things to do. <starts to leave> Alright then. Goodbye. <exits quickly>
