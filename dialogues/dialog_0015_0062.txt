DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here about something with my work. It’s… well, it’s about the masks they want us to wear. And the other protective gear. I’m having a bit of trouble with them.
DOCTOR: Masks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s not that I don’t want to be careful, you understand. I work with folks, and I want to keep everyone safe. But the masks… they make it hard to breathe, and honestly, they give me a bad feeling. Like something’s… closing in. I’ve tried a few different kinds, but it’s the same with all of them. I was hoping we could talk about maybe getting an exemption, or finding another way to do things.
DOCTOR: A bad feeling, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not just the feeling of something on my face. It feels… older than that. Like a weight. My grandmother… she always said our people have to be careful about things covering the face. It’s… a tradition, I suppose. Not a rule, exactly, but a feeling. It makes me anxious, and I worry it affects my work. I need to be clear-headed when I’m helping people. I don’t want to be distracted by feeling… trapped.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, Mr. Knabenshue, while I appreciate your… cultural sensitivities, we do have safety protocols to adhere to. It's important for both your well-being and the well-being of your colleagues and patients. However, let’s explore this further. Have you experienced any dizziness, shortness of breath, or panic attacks while wearing the masks?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor. And I haven’t had any panic attacks, exactly. It’s more… a tightening in my chest, and a feeling of being… unsettled. Like I need to get fresh air. It doesn’t happen immediately, but after a while, it builds up. And it’s not just the masks. The face shields too, a little bit. Anything that feels… confining. I can still do my job, but it takes more effort, and I’m worried about making a mistake if I’m too focused on just… breathing.
DOCTOR: A tightening in the chest… and increased effort to concentrate. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been a pretty… even-tempered person. I mean, life has its ups and downs, of course, but nothing that needed… a doctor’s attention, if you understand. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I find that helps. Being connected to the land, that’s important. But that’s hard to do when I’m stuck inside all day with a mask on. It feels… disconnected. Is it alright if I ask what kind of tests you might do to see if it’s something physical, and not just… in my head?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, while I respect your concerns, and I understand the importance of your cultural beliefs, we need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and we’ll do a brief physical exam. Then, if everything appears normal, we can discuss the possibility of a referral to a therapist to address your anxiety. It’s important to have a comprehensive understanding of what’s going on before we make any decisions. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Listening to my heart and lungs is good. And checking the oxygen… that makes sense. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not just… dismiss it. A therapist… I hadn't thought of that, but if that’s what’s needed, I’m willing to try. I just want to be able to do my job, and keep everyone safe. So, whatever you think is best. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise, your heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear, but you are breathing somewhat shallowly. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation. Let me just give this a moment to register… 96%. That’s within normal limits, but as I said, you are breathing shallowly. Do you smoke, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always thought it was a foolish habit. I’ve always been around fresh air, as I said. My grandmother… she taught me to respect the land, and everything on it. She used to say the air is a gift, and we have to treat it like one. It’s just… harder to appreciate that gift when something’s blocking my nose and mouth. Do you think it could be… the masks themselves making me breathe that way? Like my body is trying to compensate?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Mr. Knabenshue. Some individuals do experience difficulty adjusting to wearing masks, and that can lead to altered breathing patterns. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any allergies lately?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I've always been pretty sturdy, as a matter of fact. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and I haven't gotten sick with a cold or the flu in… well, I can't remember the last time. My grandmother had some herbal remedies she used to make, but I haven't used those in years. She always said a strong spirit is the best medicine, and being connected to the land keeps your spirit strong. Do you think… maybe a different type of mask might help? Something looser, perhaps? Or made of a different material?
DOCTOR: While a different mask might provide some temporary relief, Mr. Knabenshue, it doesn't address the underlying anxiety. I understand your cultural beliefs, and I’m not dismissing them. However, your symptoms—tightness in the chest, altered breathing patterns—are indicative of anxiety. I recommend a referral to a therapist specializing in culturally sensitive care. They can help you develop coping mechanisms to manage your anxiety and address any underlying emotional issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I suppose so. If you think it will help me understand… why I’m feeling this way, then I’m willing to try. I just want to be able to do my job, and not feel… trapped. Do you have a list of therapists who… understand about traditions, and things like that? Someone who wouldn’t just tell me to… calm down? It’s more complicated than that, you see. It's about respect, and connection, and… a feeling I can’t quite explain. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you have someone you recommend, I'd like to hear about them.
DOCTOR: I do have a list of qualified therapists in the area. Dr. Eleanor Vance specializes in culturally sensitive therapy, with experience working with Indigenous communities. She has a strong reputation for providing compassionate and understanding care. Here’s her contact information and a brief bio. I would suggest scheduling an initial consultation with her to discuss your concerns. In the meantime, I recommend practicing deep breathing exercises to help manage your anxiety. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Dr. Vance… I’ll look into her. A consultation sounds like a good idea. Deep breathing exercises… I suppose I can try that. I used to do that with my grandmother, when I was a child. It helped calm the spirit, she said. I think I remember how. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for listening, and for not dismissing my concerns. It means a lot. I appreciate your time. And I’ll be sure to call Dr. Vance’s office. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Knabenshue. I wish you all the best. If you experience any worsening symptoms, or have any concerns, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day.
