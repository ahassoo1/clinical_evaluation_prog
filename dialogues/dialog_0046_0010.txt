DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about some swelling, as I understand it. To be honest, the details are… a bit hazy. I just noticed it recently and thought it best to have it checked out. I don’t quite recall how recent, precisely.
DOCTOR: I see. That's perfectly alright; we can work through the details together. "Some swelling" is a good starting point. Could you tell me where you're noticing the swelling, specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… around here, on my neck. Mostly on this side, I think. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels… full? It’s hard to explain. And, again, I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I don't remember if it appeared suddenly or gradually.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. It's very common to have trouble recalling precise details, especially when it comes to something that developed over time. We'll take our time. "Feels full" is helpful – is it firm to the touch, or more soft and pliable?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It feels… more firm, I would say. Not rock-hard, but definitely not soft like my usual skin. It’s… noticeable when I touch it, compared to the other side. Does that make sense? I hope I’m being clear.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Jahaad. Firm, and noticeable compared to the other side. Excellent. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I… I haven’t felt unwell, if that’s what you mean. No fever, no chills. I haven’t had any trouble swallowing, or breathing. I think I haven't, anyway. It’s so difficult to be certain. Perhaps a little fatigue, but I often feel a bit tired. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Fatigue can definitely be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. And it’s good to hear you haven’t experienced any difficulty with swallowing or breathing. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… now that you mention it… I honestly don't know. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I… I suppose I haven’t noticed any dramatic changes in my clothes, but that’s not a very precise measurement, is it? I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s truly frustrating not to be able to provide a clearer picture.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Jahaad. We’re gathering information, and it’s perfectly normal not to have all the answers readily available. No need to apologize. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: To the best of my knowledge… no, I don't believe so. I've generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing major. I had a bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that’s about it. I haven’t been regularly seen by a doctor in… well, it’s been a while, if I’m being honest. Perhaps that’s why I'm struggling to recall things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jahaad. Many people don’t see a doctor regularly unless there’s a specific issue. And it's good to hear you haven't had any major illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. I had my tonsils removed when I was very young, perhaps? But that was so long ago, and I barely remember it. Otherwise, no. No surgeries that I’m aware of. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Jahaad. So, tonsillectomy as a child, and nothing else to your knowledge. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… This is… difficult. I wasn't very close to my family, and I don't know much about their medical backgrounds. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn’t have much contact with my father’s side of the family. I believe my grandfather had some heart problems, but that's all I really know. I’m sorry I can’t be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jahaad. It’s not always possible to have detailed family history information. We can proceed without it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I've never experienced any allergic reactions that I’m aware of. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication. I'm quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is there anything else you'd like to know, Doctor? I'm happy to try and recall anything that might be helpful.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Jahaad. And thank you for being so forthcoming. Just one final question for now regarding your history: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not currently taking any medications. Not prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I can, preferring to let my body heal naturally. I believe that's everything, Doctor? I'm happy to answer any further questions you may have.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jahaad. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your neck to get a better sense of the swelling. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand the need for a physical exam. Please, do whatever you need to do. And I will certainly let you know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, regarding your neck… the swelling is located on the left side, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. It feels firm, non-tender, and slightly mobile. There's no warmth or redness to the skin in that area. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes elsewhere in your neck.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn't bad at all. It feels… strange, but not particularly painful, no. Just… noticeable. I appreciate you being gentle. Does that mean anything specific, Doctor? Is it cause for concern? I understand you likely need further tests, but I confess, I'm a little anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear it wasn’t too uncomfortable. And it’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Jahaad. I want to be upfront: the firm, mobile mass warrants further investigation to determine its cause. It could be a number of things, most of which are benign, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Based on my initial examination, I would like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid function test to start. We may also need to consider an ultrasound of your neck to get a more detailed image of the mass. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. I understand the need for further tests. It’s better to be thorough, as you say. A CBC and TFT… and possibly an ultrasound. What exactly would those tests tell us, Doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results? I confess, I’m not very familiar with medical procedures.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A complete blood count, or CBC, will give us a general overview of your blood cells. It can help us identify any signs of infection or inflammation. The thyroid function test, or TFT, will assess how well your thyroid gland is working. The thyroid is located in your neck, and sometimes masses can be related to thyroid issues. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the structures in your neck, allowing us to visualize the mass more clearly. It will help us determine its size, shape, and consistency, and whether it’s solid or fluid-filled. Typically, the results should be available within 2 to 3 business days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense, thank you. CBC to check for infection, TFT to assess the thyroid, and an ultrasound for a visual image. Two to three business days for the results… and a follow-up appointment. And… what if the results aren’t good, Doctor? What's the worst-case scenario? I understand you can't give me a definitive diagnosis without the tests, but… I’d prefer to be prepared, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Jahaad. It's good to be prepared. While most neck masses are benign, it’s important to be aware of the possibilities. In rare cases, a neck mass could be a sign of an infection requiring antibiotics, or, less commonly, a sign of a more serious condition like lymphoma. However, it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. The tests will give us the information we need to determine the exact cause of the mass and develop an appropriate treatment plan, if one is necessary. If the results indicate a more concerning condition, we would discuss your options, which could include further imaging, a biopsy, or referral to a specialist. But again, let's focus on getting the test results first. Worrying about worst-case scenarios before we have any concrete information won’t be helpful. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds reasonable. Focus on the test results first. Don’t jump to conclusions. Okay. So, what do I need to do now? How do I schedule the tests? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Avoiding strenuous activity, perhaps? Or… anything else? I just want to be proactive, if possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to write you a referral for the CBC and TFT, and I’ll also schedule an appointment for you to have an ultrasound at the imaging center down the street. They're very efficient and have excellent technicians. I'm printing out the paperwork now. In the meantime, there's no need to restrict your activity. Just continue to monitor the mass for any changes in size, shape, or consistency, and let me know if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, pain, or difficulty swallowing. I’ve also written a note for your primary care physician, informing them of our findings. Here's the paperwork, and here’s a card with the imaging center’s contact information. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the appointment scheduling?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very helpful. No, I don’t think so. The instructions seem clear enough. I’ll schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible, and continue to monitor the mass for any changes. Thank you again for your patience and your thoroughness. I feel… somewhat reassured, despite the uncertainty. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes, or if I have any further questions. I think that’s everything for today, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. And yes, that seems to be everything for today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch once the test results are available. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I appreciate your kindness.
