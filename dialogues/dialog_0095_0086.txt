DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Let me pull up those results here… Okay. So, you came in last week with complaints of fatigue and some muscle aches, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. Mostly just feeling really run down, and my legs feel like I’ve been doing squats for hours even when I haven’t. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks. And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not really, honestly. Resting doesn’t seem to do much, and it doesn’t really get worse with activity, it’s just… always there. Kind of annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats with this fatigue?
PATIENT: Nope, no fever or anything like that. Definitely haven't been sweating at night. Just tired and achy. Is something wrong? What did the tests show?
DOCTOR: Okay. The tests came back showing a slightly elevated creatine kinase level, and some mild inflammation markers. We also checked your thyroid, and that looks normal. Now, the elevated CK can indicate muscle damage or inflammation. It's not a huge elevation, but it's enough to warrant a little further investigation. Do you have any family history of muscle problems or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm. Autoimmune… my grandmother on my mom’s side had… something with her joints, I think. Rheumatoid arthritis, maybe? Not sure. And my dad's side… not really. Mostly just heart trouble, I think. What does this mean for me, though? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the rheumatoid arthritis. That's helpful information. It doesn't necessarily mean you have that, but it adds to the picture. The elevated CK and mild inflammation could be a number of things – a viral infection that’s still lingering, even if you don’t feel sick right now, or a mild form of myositis, which is inflammation of the muscles. We want to rule out anything more serious, though. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your muscle strength and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a shipment coming in this afternoon I need to get sorted. So, muscle strength and reflexes, got it. Let’s do it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll start with your legs. I'll ask you to push against my hands while I provide resistance. Just let me know if you feel any pain during the exam.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best. Hopefully this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you push your foot against my hand like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that enough? It doesn’t hurt or anything, just feels… normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your leg. And that one… and now the other leg. Okay. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s check your arms. Could you please extend your arm straight out, palm up, and I’ll provide resistance as you try to bend your elbow?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little hard to tell if it’s weaker or not, honestly. I work with shipments all day, so my arms get a workout anyway.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Strength is also 5/5 in your arms. No noticeable weakness at this time. Now, just to be thorough, are you experiencing any skin rashes or sensitivity to sunlight?
PATIENT: Nope, no rashes or anything. I spend most of my time inside at the warehouse, so not much sun exposure. Everything feels pretty normal on that front. Can we get to the point now? What do you think it is? Is it something serious? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the physical exam and the lab results, it's unlikely to be anything immediately serious. However, the slightly elevated CK and inflammation markers still need to be investigated. The most likely scenario at this point is a mild form of myositis, possibly triggered by a recent viral infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a few more blood tests – specifically, we'll check for certain autoimmune antibodies. I’m also going to order a Vitamin D level. To be on the safe side, I'd also like you to get an MRI of your thighs to look for any subtle muscle inflammation. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? An MRI? That sounds expensive, and it’s going to take up a lot of time. I don't have insurance, remember? Is it absolutely necessary? Can't we just... try something? Like, physical therapy or something? I really can’t afford a bunch of tests right now. What if it's just stress? I’ve been really busy lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and time commitment, Ms. Kovtun. It’s frustrating to deal with this when you don't have insurance. You’re right to ask if it’s absolutely necessary. Physical therapy could be helpful, and stress certainly can contribute to muscle aches. However, because of that slightly elevated CK, we need to rule out anything more serious before we start treatment. Ignoring it could potentially lead to a bigger problem down the road. Let's explore some options. I can write a referral to a rheumatologist who offers a sliding scale fee based on income. That might make the visit more affordable. As for the MRI, let me see if the imaging center offers any financial assistance programs or a cash discount. I can also provide you with a detailed explanation of the costs upfront, so you can make an informed decision. Would you be open to me looking into those options for you?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. That would be… really helpful, actually. A sliding scale fee sounds good, and checking for discounts on the MRI would be amazing. I appreciate you trying to work with me. I just… I have deadlines, you know? And bills. So anything that makes it easier is good. Let me know what you find out, and I'll try to schedule something as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kovtun. I'll get those referrals and cost estimates for you right away. I’ll also send the lab orders to your email so you can schedule those at your convenience. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates the muscle aches. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’re getting me the referrals and lab orders, I’ll try not to overdo it. Just… please email those as soon as possible? Thanks, Doctor. I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kovtun. I will email those over to you immediately. I understand you have a busy schedule. Get back to work safely, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
