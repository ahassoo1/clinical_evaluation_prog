DOCTOR: Right, Deloris Wrye. 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Osga, is it? Yes. Well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… pet. I need a letter saying I can have a pet, you see. The landlord needs it. A very fussy man, that one. Honestly, the things they ask these days!
DOCTOR: A letter… for your pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! For the pet. It's… rather silly, isn’t it? But he’s very strict about… well, everything, really. Says he needs to know what kind of pet it is, how big it gets, that sort of thing. I just… I don’t really know what all he needs on it, to be honest. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you need me to write a letter detailing… your pet. And what is this pet, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s a dog. A small dog. A… well, I think it’s a chihuahua? Or maybe a… terrier mix? Honestly, I got it from a friend of a friend, and she wasn't very clear on the breed. It's… brown. And fluffy. Not too fluffy, mind you. It doesn't shed much, which is good, because I hate cleaning. Does that help? Honestly, I don’t know why landlords care so much about these things. It’s a dog!
DOCTOR: A… “small, brown, fluffy” dog. And you have no idea of the breed. And you’re asking me to vouch for it?
PATIENT: Well, yes! That’s what doctors are for, isn’t it? To write letters? And it’s a perfectly reasonable request! I mean, he wants to be sure it’s a… a suitable pet. And I assure you, it is. It’s very well-behaved. Mostly. It barks at the postman sometimes, but who doesn’t? I just need the letter, you see. It’s quite a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a physician. I deal with medical issues. I don't… authenticate pets. I'm not sure what you expect me to write in this letter, frankly. Do you have any idea what a medical history even is?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history? No, not really. Is that… important? I just thought… well, the last doctor I saw wrote a note for my gym membership, so I figured this would be the same sort of thing. Surely writing a letter isn’t so different from writing a note? It’s just words, isn’t it? Honestly, people complicate things unnecessarily. All I need is a piece of paper saying I can have a dog. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: This is… extraordinary. Look, I can document your current health status, if you’d like. Any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my knees ache a bit sometimes, especially when it's cold. And I get headaches. But who doesn’t? Honestly, I think that’s just… getting older. Nothing a good lie-down can’t fix. I don’t think any of that is relevant to the dog, though. It's a very healthy dog, I assure you. It eats and sleeps and… well, you know, dog things. Can we just focus on the letter, please? It's really quite urgent. The landlord is breathing down my neck!
DOCTOR: I am not going to write a letter authenticating your pet. It’s not a medical issue, and it’s a misuse of my professional time. I can offer to assess your headaches, if you'd like. Or your knees. But that’s it. Do you have any actual medical concerns that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… honestly, no. Not really. It really is just the dog. I thought… I thought this is what doctors did. Write letters. Help people with… things. Maybe I should go somewhere else? I don't want to be a bother. But honestly, where else would I go for a pet ownership letter? This is all very frustrating, you know. A perfectly reasonable request… .
DOCTOR: Look, I’m happy to document any legitimate health concerns. But I cannot, and will not, write a letter about your dog. Perhaps an animal veterinarian would be a more appropriate resource. Stop wasting my time.
