DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Bilstein. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you. Let me see… my legs. They bother me, mostly at night. Cramping, you know. It's a terrible feeling. I don't rightly remember when it started, just… gradually. It’s been going on for a bit now.
DOCTOR: I see. Leg cramping, primarily at night, that's been developing gradually. Can you describe the cramping for me?
PATIENT: Well… it's a tight feeling. A hard pulling, like something is knotted up in there. Mostly in the calf, I think. Both legs, usually. It wakes me up sometimes. Not every night, but often enough to be a nuisance. I try to stretch it out, but… it doesn't always help. It just… hurts. A sharp ache, mostly. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. A tight, pulling sensation, mainly in the calves of both legs, often waking you at night. You've tried stretching with limited relief, and you describe it as a sharp ache. Now, to get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when this cramping typically occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It's hard to say exactly when. Like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. But mostly… after I've been sitting for a spell. Or sometimes just… when I'm lying in bed. It doesn’t seem to matter much, really. It just… happens. More often when it's cooler, maybe? Though I can't be certain. Is that helpful? I feel bad not being more precise.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. Don't worry about being precise; we'll get there together. So, it seems to occur somewhat randomly, but perhaps more frequently after periods of sitting or while at rest, and possibly worsened in cooler temperatures. Now, have you noticed anything that relieves the cramping besides stretching?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes… walking around helps a little. Just getting up and moving. It doesn't cure it, mind you, but it takes the edge off. And… a warm bath. A good, long soak in warm water. That feels nice. But it doesn't last long, the relief. It comes back, eventually. I don't know if that's any help.
DOCTOR: That’s very good information. Walking and warm baths offer some temporary relief. Now, I'd like to ask about other areas of your health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with the leg cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well… I get tired, naturally. I’m an old woman, after all. But… nothing specific. No swelling in my legs, no numbness or tingling. My appetite is alright, though I don’t eat as much as I used to. And… I suppose my feet get cold easily. But I always have cold feet! Is that what you mean? I just… feel old, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Bilstein. It’s important to get a full picture. So, no swelling, numbness, or tingling in the legs. Appetite is okay, and you generally feel tired. Cold feet, which you’ve experienced for a while. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… My husband, bless his soul, he had the pressure. High blood pressure, that was. I think I had a touch of it myself, years ago. The doctor put me on a… a little white pill. For a while. But I stopped taking it. It didn’t seem to be doing much, and I didn’t like taking pills. As for anything else… not that I recall. I don’t go to the doctor much. Never have, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I don't think I have anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. A history of slightly elevated blood pressure treated briefly with medication. And generally, you’ve been healthy, avoiding regular doctor visits. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, my… Let me see… When I was a young woman, I had my tonsils out. A very long time ago, that was. And… when I broke my wrist, many years ago. Fell down the stairs, it was. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else, that I can remember. No major hospital stays, no other surgeries. Just the usual bumps and bruises of life. I hope that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Bilstein. Tonsillectomy in your youth and a broken wrist with no other surgeries or major hospitalizations. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… they weren’t ones for talking about such things. My mother, she had… trouble with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe. But she didn't go to the doctor either. And my father… he was a strong man, always healthy. I don’t recall any heart trouble or diabetes in the family. They mostly just… suffered in silence. I’m afraid I don’t have much to tell you on that front. Is that alright? I hate to be unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bilstein. Family history can be difficult to recall. Some joint trouble in your mother is good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your daily life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And alcohol… only a small glass of wine with supper on special occasions. Very rarely, mind you. And drugs… well, I don’t even know what you mean! I’m an old woman, Doctor. I lead a quiet life. Just reading, knitting, and visiting with friends. Nothing exciting, I assure you. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Bilstein. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Now, one last set of questions regarding your current medications. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I used to take something for my… well, for a little bit of anxiety. Just when I felt a bit… fluttery. But the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said it wasn’t doing much good. And… I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. But that’s it, really. Just the vitamin D, occasionally. Nothing else. Is that helpful? I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Bilstein. Discontinued anxiety medication years ago and occasional vitamin D supplements. Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be causing your leg cramps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better. Whatever needs to be done, just let me know. I’m a bit worried, I confess, but I suppose it’s better to know what’s going on. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check the pulses in your legs and feet, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes and sensation. Finally, I’ll take a look at your legs themselves for any signs of swelling or other abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Your heart sounds regular, a little slow, but nothing concerning at this time. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check the pulses in your feet. Your pulses are a bit weak, but present in both feet. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, but present. Finally, I’ll take a quick look at your legs. I don’t see any obvious swelling or skin changes on your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well, that wasn’t too bad. Everything seems alright, then? Is there something wrong? Or is it just… old age? I worry so much. My husband, he used to say I worry too much. But it’s hard not to, when things aren’t quite right. Is it serious, Doctor? Please, tell me the truth.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions, Ms. Bilstein. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and understand what's going on. Based on the exam and what you've told me, it doesn't seem like anything is seriously wrong. However, the diminished pulses and reflexes, combined with your leg cramps, suggest there might be some mild peripheral artery disease, meaning there's some narrowing of the arteries in your legs, reducing blood flow. It’s also possible these symptoms are related to general age-related changes in the circulation and nervous system. I want to be upfront; I'm not able to give you a definitive diagnosis without further testing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests, including an ankle-brachial index to measure blood flow in your legs, and a basic blood panel to check your overall health and rule out any other contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, my… tests? Well… I suppose if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don't particularly like tests, but I want to feel better. And if that’s what it takes… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. What sort of tests are they? Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about things, you see. I'm just an old woman, and I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Bilstein, and you’re not a bother at all. The ankle-brachial index is a very simple, painless test. We'll use a Doppler ultrasound device to measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. It takes about 20-30 minutes. The blood panel will involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It will help us check things like your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. This will also take about 20-30 minutes, and may have a small cost associated with it, although we can discuss options if that’s a concern. The results usually take a few days to come back from the lab. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to help manage your leg cramps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound too terrible, I suppose. No needles? Well, a small one, you say. And a few days… I can manage a few days. As for the cost… I don’t have much money, Doctor. My husband, bless his soul, he took care of all that. I live on a small pension, and… well, it doesn't go far. But if it’s important, I suppose I can find a way. We can talk about it, yes? I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… please don't let it be too expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Bilstein. Your financial wellbeing is important to me, and we can definitely discuss options. We have a financial assistance program that may be able to help with the cost of the tests. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first, and discuss whether additional tests are necessary based on the initial results. Let’s start with the ABI test. It’s the least invasive and least expensive option, and will give us a good starting point. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that sounds alright. As long as it’s not too early. I’m not much of a morning person, you see. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so understanding. It's a relief to talk to someone who listens. And for the help with the cost. I appreciate it more than you know. So, tomorrow morning it is? What time? And where should I go? I don’t want to get lost.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It’s my pleasure. Tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. We can meet right here in the examination room, just as we are now. The technician, Sarah, will come in and perform the ABI test. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes. I’ll also have my nurse, Emily, stop by before you leave today to give you a form outlining the financial assistance options. Please don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. Before we finish, do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, 9:00 AM… alright. Yes, that's manageable. And Sarah, you say? A nice technician, I hope. Hmm… let me see. I suppose… is it serious, Doctor? This narrowing of the arteries… is it something terrible? Will I have to have surgery? I worry so much about my legs. I need them to get around, you see. Will I be alright?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re worried, Ms. Bilstein. Let’s address those concerns directly. The narrowing of the arteries, or peripheral artery disease, can range in severity. Many people experience mild symptoms that can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. It doesn't automatically mean you’ll need surgery. We’ll start with the ABI test to assess the extent of the narrowing. If it’s mild, we can focus on things like walking regularly, maintaining a healthy weight, and potentially starting a medication to improve blood flow. If it's more severe, we might consider further testing to determine the best course of action. Surgery is typically reserved for more serious cases where other treatments aren't effective. I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll get the results of the ABI test, discuss your options thoroughly, and make a decision together that's best for your health and wellbeing. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That does help, Doctor. One step at a time… yes. That's sensible. I like that. And you'll explain everything, you say? Thoroughly? I do get confused easily, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain things. It makes me feel… safer. And less worried. So, the ABI test tomorrow morning, and then we'll talk. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. I believe I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It’s my pleasure. And yes, I will absolutely explain everything thoroughly, and we can go over it as many times as you need. Let me have Emily come in and give you the financial assistance form, and she can also schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from tomorrow to discuss the results. Emily, could you come in here for a moment, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That would be lovely. I do feel a bit better now, Doctor. Knowing there’s a plan, you see. And that you’ll explain everything. It’s a relief. I just hope… I hope it’s not too serious. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem very competent. And kind.
DOCTOR: That means a lot to me, Ms. Bilstein. We'll take excellent care of you. Emily, this is Ms. Bilstein. She’s scheduled for an ABI test tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Could you give her this form outlining the financial assistance options and schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from tomorrow to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Thank you for your help. I do appreciate it. A week from tomorrow… yes, that sounds alright. Please, take your time. I’m not in any hurry. I believe that’s everything for now, isn't it? Thank you both again.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for now. Emily will walk you to the reception desk to check out. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Bilstein. We'll see you tomorrow morning.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's very kind of you. Thank you both again. You've put my mind at ease. A pleasure meeting you both as well. And thank you, Emily, for your help. .
