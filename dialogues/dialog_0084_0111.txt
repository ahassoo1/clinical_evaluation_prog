DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't much time for this. It's... my skin. It’s darkening. And I’m… terribly fatigued. Always tired, you see. It's quite inconvenient. I've been working, of course. Reinforcing iron is strenuous work, and I’m not as young as I once was. Though, I suspect it’s more than just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue… and you do physically demanding work. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. When did you first notice the skin darkening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I rarely pay attention to such trivialities. Some months, I suppose. Perhaps… six months? It was gradual, not sudden. And truthfully, I haven't the faintest idea what triggered it. I simply noticed it one day whilst shaving. A rather unpleasant surprise, I assure you. Now, are we nearing the end of this consultation?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual skin darkening. And it was first noticed while shaving, so primarily on your face?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. The face, mostly. Though, I’ve observed it on my hands as well, naturally. All this… manual labor, you see. It’s quite obvious, really. I fail to understand why we must delve into such minute details. Is it… contagious? My wife would be most displeased.
DOCTOR: It's good you asked about contagious – it’s not likely to be, but we need to rule things out. Okay, so face and hands primarily. Have you noticed any itching, pain, or blistering on those areas?
PATIENT: Itching… hmm. A slight discomfort, perhaps. Barely noticeable. Blistering? No, certainly not. Just… a darkening, as I’ve said repeatedly. And a general weariness, of course. This fatigue is quite debilitating. I find it increasingly difficult to complete even the simplest tasks. Is this… something serious? Though, I suspect it’s merely old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blistering, slight discomfort. And fatigue is your main concern aside from the skin darkening. Have you noticed any other symptoms, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. And I sleep… fitfully. Wake up several times a night. But those are hardly noteworthy, are they? Everyone suffers from a lack of sleep as they age. Honestly, Doctor, I find this entire process rather… tedious. Are we any closer to a diagnosis? My wife is expecting me home for luncheon.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and trouble sleeping. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. At my age, one accumulates a litany of ailments. I’ve had… aches and pains, naturally. A touch of arthritis, I believe. And a persistent cough during the winter months. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. I’ve rarely been ill. Though, I suppose I haven’t been to a doctor in… decades. Is this necessary? I fail to see how my past aches and pains are relevant to a darkening of the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and a winter cough. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Absolutely not. A sturdy man like myself doesn't require hospitalization. Surgeries? Goodness, no. I’ve always prided myself on my physical wellbeing. I've managed to avoid such… invasive procedures. Now, Doctor, are we making any progress? My wife will be quite concerned if I'm delayed much longer. She prepared my favorite dumplings.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospitalizations, no surgeries. And you haven't had any significant illnesses that required treatment. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I am a firm believer in natural remedies. I have always avoided those… chemical concoctions whenever possible. I take a tonic, occasionally, for my joints. Something my wife purchases from the herbalist down the street. But that is the extent of it. Honestly, this line of questioning is rather… insulting. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of maintaining my health without resorting to pharmaceuticals. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I’ve answered your queries sufficiently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a herbal tonic for your joints. Do you know the name of that tonic, or what ingredients are in it?
PATIENT: The name? Good heavens, no. My wife handles those details. She’s quite knowledgeable about such things. Ingredients… I couldn’t possibly say. Various herbs and roots, I presume. Something about strengthening the… chi. Honestly, Doctor, I find your insistence on these minutiae quite perplexing. I came here because of a darkening of the skin, not to provide you with a detailed inventory of my wife’s herbal purchases. I really must be going. Is there anything definitive you can tell me? Or am I to continue enduring this tedious interrogation?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to family history then. Has anyone in your family had similar skin changes or issues with fatigue?
PATIENT: Family history… a vast and complicated matter. My family is rather… extensive. My father, he was a strong man, a farmer. Never sick a day in his life. My mother… she suffered from headaches, occasionally. But skin changes? Fatigue? I couldn’t say. It’s been decades since I’ve had any meaningful contact with most of my relatives. We… we didn’t discuss such things. It was considered impolite, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect this entire endeavor is a waste of my time. I believe I’ve provided you with sufficient information. Are you able to offer me any sort of diagnosis? Or a recommendation, at least? My wife is becoming quite concerned, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Such questions are… unseemly. I am a respectable man. I’ve never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. Smoking? Absolutely not. And recreational drugs? The very suggestion is… appalling. I lead a quiet, disciplined life. I have always prioritized my health and wellbeing. Honestly, Doctor, I find your line of questioning increasingly intrusive and… frankly, insulting. I came here seeking a medical opinion, not a moral evaluation. I believe I've answered all your questions, and I must insist on a definitive answer or a recommendation. My wife is expecting me, and I've wasted enough of my valuable time here already. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand your frustration. Let me quickly summarize. You've presented with gradually worsening skin darkening and fatigue over the past six months. You take a herbal tonic for joint pain. You don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. You have no significant past medical history, surgeries, or hospitalizations. Given your history, and the fact that I haven't been able to get a complete picture of your medical background, I want to be cautious. Skin darkening, along with fatigue, can be caused by a number of things. It could be something simple, but it also could be a sign of something more serious. I recommend we order some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and a complete blood count. This will help us rule out some of the more common causes. I also recommend a dermatology consult so they can take a closer look at your skin and determine if a biopsy is needed. Here is a referral to Dr. Lin, a dermatologist, and a lab requisition. I'll also have the nurse draw some blood before you leave. I understand you're concerned about wasting time, but these tests are important to make sure we're not missing anything. If anything is going on, the sooner we identify it, the sooner we can address it. Does that sound acceptable?
