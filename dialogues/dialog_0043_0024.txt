DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my insurance, Medicare, needs it before they’ll cover a trip I need to take. It’s to see my sister.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. I understand. A fit-to-fly letter, absolutely. It's not uncommon for insurance companies to request those, especially for longer trips or if there are pre-existing conditions. To prepare the letter accurately, I'll need to gather some information from you. Let's start with a brief overview of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was perfectly healthy before… well, before my husband passed away last year. It was very sudden. A heart attack. I’ve been… okay, physically, since then. Just a bit tired, you know? Grief does that to you. I haven’t been to a doctor much since. Mostly just for check-ups, and those were always fine. I don’t have any ongoing conditions, no diabetes or anything like that.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Sayar. That must have been incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that you've been feeling tired, and it's good you recognize the impact grief can have on your overall well-being. Just to be thorough, even with a generally healthy history, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking – including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing at all. I really try to avoid them if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Just a basic one. And I haven’t taken that regularly since… well, since everything happened. I honestly barely remember when I last had one. I really don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Sayar. Now, regarding your trip to see your sister, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Of course. I’m flying to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. It’s a long flight – about fourteen hours, with a layover in Seoul. My sister isn't doing well, and I really need to get there as soon as possible. She asked me to come a few months ago, but… things were complicated then. I’m finally able to go now, but Medicare is being very strict about needing this letter before they’ll approve the travel costs. It's to make sure I'm fit enough to handle a long journey.
DOCTOR: I understand. A fourteen-hour flight is certainly a significant journey, and it's responsible of Medicare to ensure you're able to travel safely. To complete the fit-to-fly letter, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your current health status. Have you experienced any new or worsening symptoms recently – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, nothing new. Honestly, I feel… normal, as normal as I can be. Maybe a little anxious about the flight, but that's probably just because it's so long and I haven’t flown in years. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. My appetite is okay, I’m sleeping alright… I guess just a bit sad, but that’s not a symptom, is it? I really haven’t been sick.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you haven’t been experiencing any new physical symptoms, Ms. Sayar. And yes, grief can certainly manifest in physical ways, so feeling sad is absolutely relevant. To be as thorough as possible, could you briefly describe your typical activity level?
PATIENT: Well, before… before my husband, we were very active. We loved hiking and gardening. Now… I mostly stay home. I walk to the grocery store sometimes, and I try to do some light housework. Nothing strenuous. I mostly read, and talk to my sister on the phone. It's not much, I know, but I’m trying to keep busy. I don't have the energy for much else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Sayar. It takes time to adjust and rebuild after such a significant loss. Now, to help me get a better overall picture, would you mind if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s fine. I figured you’d want to listen to my heart and lungs or something. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d please have a seat, we’ll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick assessment of your general well-being. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous about all of this, but I understand it’s necessary for the letter.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. I will explain everything as I go, and please don't hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Your blood pressure is 128 over 82, which is within a normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular and there are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Your lungs are clear, bilaterally, with good air movement. Do you have any history of swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a little bit. My feet are usually fine. I mean, they might be a little tired after walking, but no swelling at all. I’ve always had good circulation, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Sayar. Now, just a final quick check. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Like this? Yes, I can see it clearly. No blurry vision or anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too much? I don’t want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Sayar. Everything looks good, Ms. Sayar. Based on this brief examination and our conversation, you appear to be in stable condition and physically capable of handling a long-distance flight. However, I want to be thorough and also consider the emotional stress that travel may cause, given your recent loss. Would you be open to discussing some strategies for managing anxiety during your trip?
PATIENT: That's… thoughtful of you, Doctor. Yes, please. I haven’t thought much about the anxiety part. I’m so focused on getting to my sister that I haven’t really considered how stressful the flight itself might be. Anything you can suggest would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Traveling after a significant loss can be emotionally challenging. It's perfectly normal to experience heightened anxiety. First, it's important to stay hydrated and get enough rest before and during the flight. Bring a comfortable travel pillow and noise-canceling headphones to help you relax. Distraction can be very effective—bring a good book, listen to calming music, or download some podcasts. If you feel overwhelmed during the flight, practice deep breathing exercises—inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Visualization can also be helpful—imagine yourself in a peaceful and relaxing environment. And most importantly, don’t hesitate to reach out to the flight attendants if you need assistance. They are trained to help passengers who are experiencing anxiety. I can also provide you with a list of resources for grief support if you’d like. Do any of those suggestions sound helpful, or are there other things you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Those all sound… good, actually. Very helpful. I think the deep breathing and distraction would be the most useful. And knowing the flight attendants are there is reassuring. I hadn't even thought about asking for help. Thank you. Could you… go ahead and write the letter, please? I just want to get this sorted so I can book the flight and go see my sister.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. I’m happy to do that for you. I'll include a statement confirming that, based on my assessment, you are medically cleared to travel internationally. I’ll also add a brief note about the importance of staying hydrated and managing potential anxiety during the flight. Here you are. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. I’ve included my contact information should Medicare require any further clarification. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, that’s perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Kalinski. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and address my concerns. Knowing I have this letter takes a huge weight off my shoulders.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I am glad I could help. I wish you a safe and peaceful journey to see your sister. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you experience any difficulties or have any concerns before, during, or after your trip. And remember, it’s okay to lean on others for support during this difficult time. Take care of yourself, and give my best to your sister. .
