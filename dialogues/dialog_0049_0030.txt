DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've noticed a change in how I smell, my body odor. It's...different than it usually is. I can't really explain it, just not the same. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A change in body odor… alright. And you say this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe four, five weeks now? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I usually don't have much of a smell at all, to be honest, but this is noticeable. Even after showering.
DOCTOR: Even after showering. And is it… a consistently different smell, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It’s pretty consistent, actually. It’s not like it comes and goes. It’s always…off. It’s hard to describe, but it’s not my normal scent, definitely. It's not stronger, just different. A little musky, maybe? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Musky… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… not really, not that I can think of. I haven’t changed my soap or deodorant. My diet’s been the same, pretty much. Work's been work, you know? Lots of kneeling and lifting, but that’s normal for me. I haven't been traveling or anything. Oh! Wait… I did start taking a new vitamin about a month ago. It's a multi-vitamin, with extra B vitamins. Could that be it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: A new multi-vitamin… yes, that’s something. Do you recall the brand and dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Nature's Bounty, the one for women 50+. I think it’s one pill a day. The bottle says it has a lot of B vitamins, like B12 and folate. I just thought it might be good to get a little extra, you know? I started feeling a bit tired lately, and I thought it might help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. I mean, normal aches and pains from work, but that's always there. I haven't been sick, no fever, no weight loss. My appetite's okay. Just the tiredness and now this smell. It's strange, really. I feel fine otherwise. It's just… unsettling. I always prided myself on being clean, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, it's good you're paying attention to your body. These things can sometimes be nothing, but it’s always best to investigate. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam, and I’ll likely order some blood work just to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. A physical exam and blood work sounds good. I just want to figure out what's going on. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just step over here and we’ll get started. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just take a look at your skin, looking for anything unusual. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No latex or anything else. I'm good to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. Let me just check your thyroid… Thyroid is within normal limits, no enlargement. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and just a general metabolic panel. That will give us a better idea of what might be going on.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. Vitamin levels are probably a good idea, given the new multi-vitamin. I'm happy you're checking everything. How long will it take to get the results? And do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, the vitamin levels are a good starting point. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days, depending on the lab. And yes, you will need to fast for twelve hours beforehand. No food or drinks, except water. The fasting will ensure the most accurate results. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that's clear enough, thank you. Twelve hours of fasting, only water. I can manage that. I'll make sure to schedule the blood work first thing in the morning. So, while we’re waiting for the results, is there anything else I should be looking out for? Any symptoms that might be related?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s unlikely to be anything serious, but if you experience any unexplained weight loss, excessive sweating, or changes in your energy levels, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine. Don't spend time worrying. We'll have a better idea once the blood work comes back. I will call you with the results, or we can schedule a follow-up appointment if that's your preference.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. Unexplained weight loss, excessive sweating, or energy changes. I'll keep an eye out for those. I think a phone call with the results would be fine, unless they’re… concerning. Thank you for taking this seriously and explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll call you with the results. Don’t hesitate to contact us if anything changes. Here’s the requisition form. Remember the fasting instructions. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
