DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve noticed a bit of… discharge. Yes, discharge. From… down there. It's not pleasant, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick, no need to be embarrassed. These things happen, and we’re here to figure it out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea why it’s happening. I haven’t… well, it’s been quite a while since I’ve been… intimate with anyone. I certainly haven’t done anything to cause this. It just… started. A few days ago, I believe. It’s not a lot, but enough to be… concerning. Is this common, Doctor? It doesn’t seem… dignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what does the discharge look like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not… clear. More… yellowish, I suppose. And it’s a bit… thick. Not watery, thankfully. And there’s a… a smell. Not a strong smell, but noticeable. It’s not like a… feminine freshness smell, if you understand what I mean. It’s… different. Honestly, it's quite upsetting. I always prided myself on… cleanliness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. Thank you for being so open with me. It’s helpful to have that level of detail. And you're right to be concerned; changes like that warrant investigation. Do you have any itching, burning, or pain associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain. And no itching, either. It’s just… there. I noticed it on my undergarments, that’s how I knew. It’s more… a nuisance, really. But a very unpleasant nuisance. I do try to keep everything very clean, as I said. Perhaps it’s just… a bit of irritation? From the heat, maybe? It has been quite warm.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urination – any burning, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: No, no changes at all with urination. Perfectly normal, as far as I can tell. I drink plenty of water, you see. Always have. I wouldn't have noticed if that were different, I'm quite regular. I really don't understand what could be causing this. It's just… baffling. And rather worrisome, to be frank. Is it something serious, Doctor? You can be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick pelvic exam. We'll also take a sample of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? It's just… I find those rather… intrusive. And I assure you, I haven't been doing anything to warrant such an examination. Couldn't we just… prescribe something? Perhaps an ointment?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick, and I want to assure you we’ll make it as comfortable as possible. However, to properly diagnose the cause of the discharge – and make sure we’re treating the right thing – an exam and lab tests are the best course of action. It could be a simple infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Just prescribing something without knowing the cause could potentially mask a more serious issue. Would you like me to explain the exam process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist it's absolutely necessary. But do be gentle, Doctor. And please explain everything as you go along. I really don’t like surprises. Honestly, the thought of it is quite distressing. Are you certain this won’t be… unpleasant? I do have a rather low tolerance for… discomfort. And please, no students present. I would not appreciate that at all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. I completely understand. We will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain each step before I do it. I assure you, we'll proceed at your pace. And absolutely no students will be present – your privacy is our top priority. First, you’ll lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. We'll use a speculum – a gently curved instrument – to get a better view of your cervix. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Then, I’ll collect a small sample of the discharge with a swab for lab testing. The whole process usually takes just a few minutes. Does that sound a little more manageable?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it that way… it sounds slightly less alarming. Though I still maintain I haven't done anything to cause this. A few minutes, you say? Very well. But please, be quick about it. And do warn me before you do anything, as you promised. I really don't like being caught off guard. And… is there anything I should do to prepare? Or… anything I should expect afterwards? Bleeding, perhaps? Or… soreness?
DOCTOR: Okay. You shouldn't need to do anything special to prepare. You might feel a slight cramping or pressure during the speculum exam, but most women don't find it painful. Some light spotting is possible afterward, but it’s usually minimal and resolves quickly. You may have some mild soreness for a short time, but that should improve within a day or two. We'll give you a pad to use after the exam. If you're ready, we can get started. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point, and we can stop or adjust as needed. I'll explain each step as we go along.
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s get it over with, then. The sooner it’s finished, the better. And do remember, gentle now, Doctor. I have a very delicate constitution, you see. I do hope this doesn’t take long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. Thank you. I’m going to start by having you lie back and placing your feet in the stirrups. Take a few deep breaths to help you relax. Now, I'm just going to gently insert the speculum. You might feel some pressure, but try to relax your muscles as much as possible. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, just a moment...
PATIENT: Oh… that is a bit uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… cold. And… intrusive. Are you sure you need to go in that far? It feels… very exposed. Hurry, please, Doctor. This is rather unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. I apologize; I'm just getting the best possible view. It’s a necessary step for the exam, but I will be as quick as possible. Now, I’m just going to collect a small sample of the discharge with a swab. This will only take a moment. Okay, all done. Just a moment while I remove the speculum. There we go. All finished. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. That was… quite unpleasant. And I feel a bit… raw, if I’m being honest. Is it over now? Really? I’d like to get dressed, if you don’t mind. And perhaps a glass of water? I feel a bit faint. Honestly, this whole experience has been… most distressing.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wartick, it’s all over now. I’m very sorry for the discomfort. Here’s some water. Please take your time getting dressed. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Are you feeling a bit better?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. That helps. And… being covered up again is certainly a relief. It’s just… I’m not accustomed to such… examinations. It feels like a violation, if I’m being blunt. Honestly, I’d rather not go through that again. So, what did you find? Is it something serious? Please, tell me the truth, Doctor. Don’t sugarcoat it. And is there anything I can do to… prevent this from happening again? Assuming it’s preventable, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Ms. Wartick, and I apologize again for any discomfort. It’s never pleasant to undergo an examination like that. I’ve sent the sample to the lab, and we should have the results in a few days. Based on what I saw visually, there's some inflammation, but it’s too early to say definitively what's causing it. It could be a common bacterial infection, like bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis, or it could be a yeast infection. Less commonly, it could be something else. To be cautious, I’m going to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic while we wait for the lab results. This will treat most common infections. If the symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they worsen, we'll need to consider further testing. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching, wearing cotton underwear, and keeping the area clean and dry. As for preventing this in the future, it's often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause. However, maintaining good hygiene and avoiding irritants can help. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A broad-spectrum antibiotic… that sounds rather… harsh. Are there any side effects? I’m not fond of taking medication, you see. And what if it doesn’t work? Will I have to endure another… examination? Honestly, the thought fills me with dread. And you say it’s difficult to pinpoint a cause… so, this could happen again? Is this something I’ll have to live with? Oh dear. This is most unsettling. And what about… transmission? Is there any risk to… anyone? I need to know these things, Doctor. Please, be thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick. You're right to ask these questions. Broad-spectrum antibiotics do have potential side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, or yeast infections. However, these are usually mild and temporary. We can discuss ways to manage them if they occur. We’re starting with this because it covers the most common causes while we wait for the lab results. If the antibiotic doesn’t work, we’ll need to do further testing to determine the cause of the infection. This might involve a more detailed pelvic exam, or other tests. But let’s not worry about that right now. We'll cross that bridge if we come to it. Regarding transmission, some of these infections are sexually transmitted, while others are not. Until we know the specific cause, it's best to abstain from sexual activity. I understand that’s not ideal, but it’s the safest course of action. We can discuss this further once we have the lab results. I’m writing a prescription for the antibiotic now, and I’m also including instructions on how to take it and what to watch out for. I’m also going to give you a referral to a gynecologist for a follow-up appointment. They can provide more specialized care and answer any further questions you might have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A gynecologist… another specialist. It seems my private parts have become a source of endless appointments. Very well. I suppose I have no choice. A referral is fine. And… you say abstain from sexual activity. That is… inconvenient, to say the least. But I understand the need for caution. Very well. I will take the prescription and follow your instructions. But I must say, Doctor, this has been a most unpleasant experience. And I sincerely hope this antibiotic does the trick. I do not relish the thought of further examinations or specialist visits. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for? Or any… dietary restrictions I should follow? I like to be prepared, you see. And please, Doctor, if I do need to return, could I possibly see a female specialist? I would feel much more… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I’ll make a note of your preference for a female specialist. We'll do our best to accommodate that. As for symptoms to watch out for, please contact us immediately if you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or heavy bleeding. If the symptoms don’t improve within a week of starting the antibiotic, or if they worsen, let us know right away. There are no specific dietary restrictions, but staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet can help support your immune system. I understand this has been a most unpleasant experience, and I apologize again for any discomfort. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. Get well soon, Ms. Wartick.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… understanding. And I will contact you if necessary.
