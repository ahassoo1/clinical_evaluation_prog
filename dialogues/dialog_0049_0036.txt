DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Barban is correct. I am here for… a check-up before the insurance starts, I think. Medicare, they said I need this. Is that right? It is… important to have this done quickly, no?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare often requires a baseline physical exam when you first enroll. It's… standard procedure. Important, certainly. Though, honestly, the timing is always a bit… chaotic. So, let’s try to make this efficient. When you say “check-up,” are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted you to schedule this now, or is this purely for the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: No symptoms, Doctor. Nothing is… wrong. Just Medicare. They send many papers. It is… a bother, truthfully. I work hard. I do not have time for… feeling things and then talking about them. Just want to be done, you understand? It is… a formality.
DOCTOR: Right. A formality. Very well. Let's proceed with the standard physical exam, then. Just to cover all bases, even without specific complaints. First, I'll need to get some basic information. You’re Kiwane Barban, 28 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Twenty-eight. Though some days… it feels much older. Is this… a long process, Doctor? I have things to do this afternoon. Very important things.
DOCTOR: We'll try to be as quick as possible, Mr. Barban. It’s a fairly routine exam. Let's start with your height and weight. I see here you're listed as 188 centimeters and 90 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. I am tall. And… reasonably thin, for my height. My mother always said I was too skinny, but… she worries about everything. It is accurate, Doctor. Please, let us continue. I do not like standing around.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could step on the scale to confirm, then we'll move on. It’s just standard protocol, Mr. Barban. Afterwards, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes… the usual. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Lamb, rice, fish… everything. My family, we eat… traditionally. No allergies. But, if you must know, I dislike cilantro. It tastes like… soap. Is that a medical condition, Doctor? Because I assure you, it is a serious dislike.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, a dislike of cilantro is not a medical condition. Let's focus on things that are relevant. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. I have been… healthy. Always. I work hard, I eat well, I sleep enough. My father says… a strong back, strong life. No illnesses. No surgeries. A few… small cuts at work, from the machines, but nothing serious. I bandage them myself. It is… a waste of a doctor's time to mention.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family? They are… old. Very old. My grandfather, he lived to ninety. My grandmother, eighty. They all… worked hard. Mostly farming, back in Yemen. A few… heart problems, with the older ones, but nothing… specific. They did not have doctors much. It was… different then. Is this… important, Doctor? Because I do not know the specifics. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Mr. Barban. Though I understand your family history isn’t readily available. Let’s move on to your current lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Absolutely not. It is… foolish. And bad for the lungs. My father smoked, once, when he was young, but he quit. He said it was a waste of money and… dignity. No, I do not smoke. I drink… occasionally. Tea, mostly. Very strong tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? Doctor, are you suggesting something? I work hard. I have responsibilities. I do not have time for… such things. It is… beneath me. No. I do not. This is a serious question, yes? You are implying something very… impolite.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Barban. Standard procedure, simply. I assure you, I am not implying anything. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. But quickly, Doctor. I have… things. Important things. Do not take too long.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Blood pressure is 120/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Alright, Mr. Barban. Everything seems within normal limits. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. It is… satisfactory? Is this… enough for Medicare? I need a paper, I presume. A document stating I am… functioning. Can we get that quickly, Doctor? I have… appointments. Very important appointments. And frankly, I find this whole process… undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, everything appears normal. I’m generating a report for Medicare now. It will take a few moments. Here you are. This documents your baseline physical exam. It satisfies the Medicare requirement. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. This is… sufficient. Thank you. Though I use the word "thank you" loosely. I have wasted enough of my time. Goodbye, Doctor.
