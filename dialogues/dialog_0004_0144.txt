DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Deschane, you said? Hmm. Well, honestly, it's not anything serious. My daughter just thought I should… get checked out. You know how they are. Always fussing. I just thought I'd see what all the commotion was about, really. It's not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always good to be proactive, even if you're not experiencing significant discomfort. However, dismissing symptoms entirely isn't wise. To get a clear picture, even if it seems minor, could you describe what prompted your daughter's concern?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That girl… always remembers everything. Let me think… she said something about me being… “forgetful.” Can you believe it? I just misplace my keys sometimes, that's all! And maybe I repeat a story now and then, but who doesn't? It's not like I'm losing my mind, doctor. Honestly, it’s probably just age. Everything slows down eventually, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: "Forgetfulness," as you put it, can have a variety of causes. It's not necessarily simply "age," though that can be a factor. To better understand the scope of this, could you give me some specific examples?
PATIENT: Specific examples… hmm. Well, just last week, I went to the grocery store for milk and came home with… dish soap. Dish soap! I don't even need dish soap right now. And the other day, I was telling my neighbor about… oh, what was I telling her? It was a good story, I remember that. But the details… they just slipped my mind. See? That's what I mean. Little things. Nothing to worry about, really. I just… don’t recall as quickly, maybe? It’s frustrating, if anything.
DOCTOR: I see. So, recent memory lapses – both forgetting what you went to the store for, and difficulty recalling details of a conversation. Has this been a gradual change, or did it seem to come on relatively suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s… hard to say, really. It feels like it’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Not like a light switch, you know? More like… the fog rolling in. At first, it was just the little things – misplacing my glasses, forgetting a name. Now… well, now it’s… harder to keep track of things. I wouldn't say sudden, but definitely more noticeable lately. It’s just… a nuisance, if I'm honest. Don't go making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset is important information. And I assure you, Ms. Calvery, I'm not trying to make a "big deal" out of anything. I simply need to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause of these changes. Have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or behavior?
PATIENT: Thinking… behavior… hmm. Let me see. My daughter also says I’ve been… a little more irritable lately. Which is ridiculous! I’ve always been a perfectly pleasant person. But she says I snap at her more easily. And… oh dear. Now that you mention it, I have been getting lost a little more often. Not lost-lost, just… confused about which street to take to get to the bakery. It's nothing a quick turn around doesn’t fix. But yes, maybe a little more irritable. And the streets… they all look the same these days. Honestly, it's probably just stress. You know, being a widow and all. It’s… lonely.
DOCTOR: Irritability and getting disoriented even on familiar routes are concerning additions to the pattern. And while stress certainly plays a role in many health issues, these symptoms warrant further investigation. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My blood pressure used to be a little high, but the doctor put me on a pill for it. I think. It was years ago. And… I had a gallbladder removed, a long time ago. And… I’ve had arthritis in my knees for years, that’s why I walk with a cane. But other than that… nothing major, really. I used to be very healthy, you know. Lots of walking. But since my husband passed… I haven’t been as diligent, I suppose. It's hard to stay motivated. Does that answer your question? I sometimes forget what the doctor even asks me! It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, a history of gallbladder removal, and arthritis. Do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. You’d think I’d remember something like that, wouldn’t you? It was… a little white pill. No, maybe it was pink. Or… blue? Honestly, doctor, I haven’t looked at the bottle in years. My daughter handles all the medication now. She’s very organized. I just… take what she gives me. It’s probably something common. I wouldn't know the name if my life depended on it. Really, I don’t think about those things. It's just… a pill.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… My daughter gives me a vitamin D pill every morning. She says I don’t get enough sunshine. And… I think she started me on something for my knees, a white pill again, maybe? Something to help with the aching. I’m really not good with names, doctor. Honestly, I just swallow whatever she puts in front of me. She means well, of course, but sometimes I feel like a… a puppet, just taking pills all day long. It’s a bit… unsettling, really. Are you writing all this down? She’ll want to know everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, I am documenting everything. It’s important to have a complete picture of your current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – food, pollen, insect stings?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, really. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that was ages ago. And I’ve been stung by a bee once or twice, but nothing serious. Just a little swelling, that's all. My daughter always asks me if I’m allergic to anything before she gives me a new pill, and I always say no. Honestly, I think I’d know if I had a serious allergy, wouldn’t I? I’m not completely oblivious. Just a little forgetful, that's all. It’s not like I’ve ever had a life-threatening reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or other neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she got very confused towards the end of her life. My daughter always said it was “age-related decline,” but… I don’t know. She forgot who I was sometimes. It was heartbreaking, really. And my uncle… he was always a bit… eccentric. He used to wander off and get lost. I don't know if that was the same thing, though. He wasn’t very reliable, even when he was young. It’s hard to say. We didn't talk about these things much back then. It was considered… a shameful secret, I think. Honestly, I wish I knew more. It's just… a lot of vague recollections. Everything feels so distant, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Well, I used to be very active in the community. Volunteered at the hospital, book club, garden club… But since my husband passed away, I haven’t really done much. I mostly stay at home now. My daughter visits every day, which is lovely, but… it’s not the same. I used to have lots of friends, but… they’ve all moved away or… passed on. I don't really have anyone to talk to besides my daughter. It’s… lonely. Sometimes I just sit and watch television all day. It’s not a very exciting life, but… it’s comfortable. Is that what you want to know? It's hard to remember what I even did before.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That was very helpful. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just some basic neurological tests and a general check-up. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. I suppose if you’ve asked all those questions, a little exam can’t hurt. Just… don’t poke me too much, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be. And I get a little… flustered easily. Just take your time, and explain everything as you go. I'm not a difficult patient, just… a little forgetful. Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to lose my mind. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ms. Calvery. That’s a perfectly reasonable question, and we’ll do our best to get some answers. First, I'm going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we'll do a few simple tests to assess your memory and coordination. Could you please tell me your date of birth to confirm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me my date of birth? That’s… a bit embarrassing. Honestly, I haven’t thought about my birthday in years. Let me see… It was… July… no, June… Oh dear. It’s July 14th. Yes, July 14th, 1961. I think. My daughter always reminds me. It's hard to keep track of these things when you get older, you know? Don't judge me too harshly. Is that machine cold?
DOCTOR: July 14th, 1961. Thank you. And no, I assure you, I’m not judging you at all. The cuff can be a little cold, I apologize. Your blood pressure is 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Your heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions to test your memory. Can you tell me what year it is currently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What year is it? Honestly, I feel like I just celebrated a new year… Let me think… Is it 2023? No, that feels wrong. Is it 2024? My daughter said something about elections… Yes! It must be 2025. Yes, 2025. I think. Are you sure? It all blurs together these days. It's just… time flies, you know? Especially when you're not doing much. Is something wrong? Are my numbers bad?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, your numbers aren't "bad," but your response indicates some difficulty with orientation. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh, three words? Alright, let me see… Apple… Table… Penny. Yes, Apple, Table, Penny. I think I remembered them. Are they important words? My daughter always makes me do puzzles… she says it's good for my brain. This feels like a puzzle. Is it a trick? I always forget what I'm supposed to be doing. Honestly, it's frustrating. Am I doing this right?
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly fine, Ms. Calvery. Now, I'm going to ask you to spell the word "World" backwards. Can you try that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, backwards? Oh dear. That’s… a bit difficult. Let me see… D-L-R-O-W? No, that can’t be right. W-O-R-L-D? No… I always struggle with spelling. My daughter was always so good at it. Honestly, I think my brain is just… foggy. Is it okay if I skip this one? I’m getting a little flustered now. I just want to know if I’m going to lose my mind! This feels like a test I’m failing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. That’s quite alright. We can skip that one. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question about your address. Do you know your current street address?
PATIENT: Oh, my address? Oh dear. That's… embarrassing. Honestly, I haven't thought about my address in years. My daughter handles all the bills and everything. Let me see… It’s… Maple Street. Yes, Maple Street. Number… um… I think it’s 142. Or is it 124? Honestly, I’m just guessing now. It’s a little blue house with a white picket fence. Does that help? I feel like I’m letting you down. My daughter will be so disappointed. Is something terribly wrong?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That was very helpful. Based on the information you’ve provided, and the brief neurological examination we’ve just conducted, there are some concerning indicators. Your difficulty with recall, orientation, and spelling, coupled with the reported memory lapses and family history, suggest a possible cognitive impairment. However, it's important to note that this is not a definitive diagnosis. We need to conduct further testing to determine the underlying cause of these changes. I recommend an MRI of the brain, a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and a formal neuropsychological evaluation. Would you be open to pursuing these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? A blood panel? A neuropsychological… what? Honestly, doctor, that sounds… terrifying. Is it serious? Am I… am I losing my mind? My daughter always worried about this… She said my mother… I don't know. It all sounds so complicated. I just wanted to know if I was okay. Is it something terrible? I don't like tests. I don't want to know if I’m going to… fade away. Honestly, I think I need to sit down. It all feels so overwhelming. What if something is really wrong?
DOCTOR: Please, do sit down, Ms. Calvery. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. And I assure you, we're not jumping to any conclusions. These tests aren't meant to scare you, but to provide us with a clearer picture of what's going on. The tests will help us determine the cause of these changes. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency or a medication side effect. It could also be an early sign of a more significant condition, such as mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. But even if it is something more serious, early diagnosis allows us to implement strategies to manage the condition and maintain your quality of life. I recommend we start with the MRI and blood panel. I will refer you to a neurologist and neuropsychologist who specialize in these conditions. They will explain the tests in detail and answer any questions you may have. I understand you’re scared, Ms. Calvery, but you’re not alone. We'll work through this together, step by step. Would you like me to call your daughter to explain the situation and schedule the tests?
PATIENT: Oh… call my daughter? Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I don't think I can process all of this on my own. She’s very organized, and she’ll know what to ask. She always knows what to do. But… what if it is something terrible? What if I… forget who she is? That would be… devastating. Honestly, just the thought of it makes me want to cry. Can you… can you be honest with me? Is it likely to be something bad? Is it going to… change everything?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Calvery. It's natural to worry about the unknown. And I want to be honest with you, while also being cautious. Your symptoms do warrant further investigation, and there is a possibility that it could be something more significant. However, it’s far too early to say definitively. Many conditions can cause similar symptoms, and we need the results of the tests to get a clear picture. I want to emphasize that even if it is something more serious, there are treatments and support systems available to help manage the condition and maintain your quality of life. We’ll work with you and your daughter every step of the way. "Hello?
