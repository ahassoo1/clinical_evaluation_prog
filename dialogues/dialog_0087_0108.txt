DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, but… well, things came up. Been throwing up blood, mostly. Not a huge amount, but enough to make a mess, you know? And it’s… unsettling. It started a couple of days ago. I’m Brad, by the way. Brad Gentz.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brad. I understand. Throwing up blood is certainly concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. Just a couple of clarifying questions, if you don’t mind. When you say a couple of days ago, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Let me think… Tuesday, I guess. Yeah, Tuesday morning. I had a bit of a stomach ache, nothing major, thought it was just something I ate. Then later that day, there it was. Bright red. Not… chunks, if you know what I mean. More like…streaks. And it happened again yesterday, a little less, but still. Not fun. I really don't like wasting my time with this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Tuesday morning, so approximately 48 hours. And streaks of bright red blood, not large volumes. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the vomiting?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see... I've been feeling a bit weak, I suppose. Tired. But I'm always tired. Works long hours, you know? Crematory work isn't exactly a picnic. And… my stomach's been rumbling a lot. Feels empty, even after I eat. Oh, and a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Is that important? Honestly, could just be the heat. It’s been brutal lately.
DOCTOR: Weakness, fatigue, abdominal rumbling, and dizziness upon standing. Okay. And you mentioned working long hours at a crematory. Do you take any medications regularly, Brad?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Never been one for pills. Don’t trust ‘em. Used to take something for my blood pressure years ago, but didn't like how it made me feel, so I just… stopped. Doctor told me I should keep taking it, but what does he know? I take a multi-vitamin sometimes, if I remember, but that’s about it. And a lot of strong coffee, if that counts. Needs must, you know? Gotta stay awake for work.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, discontinued blood pressure medication years ago, occasional multivitamin, and significant coffee intake. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to handle a lot of… well, let's just say the remains of people who did have allergies, so I've probably been exposed to everything by now. No hives, no swelling, nothing. My wife… my late wife, she was allergic to bee stings, but that’s not my problem. Not anymore. Look, is this going somewhere? I got things to do, you know. This is a waste of my day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Gentz. Just trying to get a complete picture. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious conditions? Well, the doctor said my blood pressure was high, like I said. Kept telling me to take pills, like I said. I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, bad one, landed me in the hospital. Other than that… nothing much. I’m a pretty tough guy, always have been. Don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. My wife… she was always the sickly one, always needing someone to take care of her. It’s a relief, not having to worry about all that anymore. Really. But I digress. What’s this about my blood, then? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure, a prior case of pneumonia. Okay. And you mentioned a family history of illness with your wife. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that ran in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: Family history? Not really. My dad was a fisherman, tough as nails, lived to be eighty. Mom… she died when I was young, had a fever, I think. Nothing fancy. My wife's side… they had the usual stuff, heart problems, diabetes, you know, the American diet. They weren’t exactly health nuts. Look, is this going to take much longer? I really don't see what all this questioning is getting at. I'm throwing up blood, not writing a novel about my ancestry. And I’m not insured, by the way, so let's not start ordering a bunch of expensive tests. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns about cost and time. Given your symptoms – vomiting blood, weakness, dizziness – and your history of high blood pressure, we need to investigate this further. Vomiting blood, even a small amount, is always something we take seriously. I'd like to perform a physical exam now. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and taking your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. Long hours, stress, maybe a bad batch of coffee. Don’t go looking for something complicated. And don’t expect me to sit around all day. I got work to do. Now hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit here, and I'll begin the exam. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Your heart sounds a little… rapid. And I can hear some… faint crackles in your lower lungs. That’s not necessarily alarming, but it’s something we need to keep an eye on. Now, let’s check your abdomen. I’m going to gently press here. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, that hurts a bit. Right there, on the left side. Not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. It’s been bothering me for a couple of days, actually. Thought it was just indigestion, maybe gas. But yeah, that definitely hurts. And… feels a little swollen, maybe? Not much, but… something's not right there. Look, is that bad? Are you finding something? Just tell me straight, don't beat around the bush. I’m a practical man, I can handle it. Hopefully it’s not something expensive to fix. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting some tenderness and mild swelling in your left upper quadrant. That, combined with the crackles in your lungs and the blood you’ve been vomiting… it’s concerning. Your vital signs are showing elevated blood pressure, as well. Given these findings, I’m going to need to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and check for any signs of infection or bleeding. The CT scan will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on in your abdomen. I understand you're uninsured, and I will do my best to find the most cost-effective options for these tests. I can connect you with resources that may be able to help with the costs. However, it’s important to rule out anything serious. Possible causes could include a stomach ulcer, gastritis, or even something more concerning like a liver issue. We need to get this figured out, Mr. Gentz. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work… Great. Just what I needed. A liver issue? Honestly. Look, I don't like any of this. I'm a simple man, I work hard, I don't bother anyone. A stomach ulcer… fine. Maybe that's it. But a liver issue? That sounds… bad. Expensive. Alright, fine. Do the tests. But I'm telling you, if it's something complicated, I can’t afford it. And I don’t want to be saddled with a huge bill. Connect me with those resources, then. I need to know what this is going to cost me before you start poking around. And hurry up, please. Every minute I'm here is a minute I'm not earning a living. I’m not asking for charity, just… a straightforward answer. And don't expect me to be happy about any of this. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. I’ll put in the orders for the blood work and CT scan now. I’m also going to have our financial counselor reach out to you as soon as possible to discuss potential options and resources to help with the costs. We'll explore everything we can. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help reduce the stomach acid, just in case it is a simple ulcer. It's called Omeprazole. It’s a relatively inexpensive medication. I will also give you some instructions about dietary changes – avoid spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and anything that might irritate your stomach. The lab and radiology departments will contact you to schedule the tests. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns about the scheduling process. I know this isn’t what you wanted to hear, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. We’ll work through this together. I'll make a note to check on you in a couple of days to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… fine. Whatever. Spicy foods… I like spicy foods. Caffeine… I need caffeine. It's a lose-lose situation. Look, just… get it over with. I got work to do. I guess… when can I expect the results? And how long is this going to take? I got a schedule, you know. Can’t just drop everything and wait around for tests. And… what if it is something bad? Just tell me straight. Don’t sugarcoat it. I’m a practical man, I can handle the truth. Even if it's not a pretty one. And… can I get a copy of the test orders? Just so I know what I'm signing up for. Really. That’s all. Just… get it over with. Now.
DOCTOR: Here are the test orders. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours for the blood work results, and the CT scan results usually take a bit longer, around 3-5 business days. However, we’ll expedite things as much as possible. As for what if it’s something bad… I don’t want to scare you, Mr. Gentz. But vomiting blood can be a symptom of several things, some more serious than others. If it is something serious, we’ll discuss all your treatment options and work with you to create a plan that fits your needs and budget. We’ll also explore any assistance programs that may be available. I understand your anxiety about the costs and the waiting, and I will do everything I can to help. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe pain, dizziness, black or tarry stools, or continued vomiting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have my nurse come in and give you the prescription for Omeprazole. And again, I’ll check on you in a couple of days to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Black or tarry stools… Great. Just what I needed to worry about. Another thing to look out for. Fine. Just… leave it. I'll deal with it. I got work to do. No. That’s it. Just… get out. I need to think. And… I need a strong coffee. That’s all. Now, if you'll excuse me. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I understand. I’ll leave the prescription with the nurse. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your symptoms worsen, please seek immediate medical attention. Take care of yourself.
