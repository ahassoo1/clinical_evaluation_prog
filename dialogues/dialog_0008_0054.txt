DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, doctor. Uh... cough. I cough a lot. And tired. Always tired, yeah? Feels like... long time now. And my nose… always blocked, then runny. Then blocked again. It’s annoying, really. I dunno how long exactly... a few months, I think? Maybe longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, fatigue, and a stuffy/runny nose for a few months. That is annoying. Let's try to get a bit more detail. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm... hard to say exactly. Maybe... after the really bad rain? Last year, yeah? Big floods near my house. Everything got wet. I had to clean up a lot. Maybe then? Before that, I felt okay. Normal, you know? Just work, sleep, everything fine. I don't remember feeling this sick before the rain. But... maybe I just forgot. It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Right, after the flooding last year. Okay. And has the cough been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Uh... come and go. Mostly worse at night. When I lie down, it's bad. Makes it hard to sleep. During the day, sometimes okay. But if I move too much, like when I'm fixing tires... then it starts again. A lot of coughing. My wife complains, says I wake her up. Sorry, I can't help it. It just... happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, worse at night and with activity. Is the cough…productive?
PATIENT: Productive? What that mean? Sorry, I don't understand. Do you mean... do I cough stuff out? Yeah, yeah, I cough up... phlegm. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it's... yellow-ish. Not always, but sometimes. Sorry. It's happening now a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, coughing up phlegm, sometimes clear, sometimes yellow. And is there any blood when you cough?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Never blood. Just... stuff. Phlegm. Yellow or clear. Sometimes just... watery. Never blood, doctor. That would be... bad, right? I'd know if there was blood. I think. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood. Good. And have you had any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes feel warm. Not always high, you know? Just… hotter than normal. Chills… maybe? I work outside a lot. Gets cold sometimes. Hard to tell if it's the cough or the weather. Body aches… yeah, a little. Mostly when I’m really tired. Like after a long day fixing tires. Everything hurts a bit, but… I always ache a bit. It’s my job, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, cough with phlegm, occasional warmth, maybe some chills, and body aches. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies – to pollen, dust, animals, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I don’t think so. I work with tires all day, lots of dust. But I've always worked with tires. Never bothered me before. My wife has allergies, to flowers, she says. Makes her sneeze a lot. But me… I’m okay. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Maybe… sometimes my eyes itch a bit, but that's just the dust, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you taken any recently for this cough or anything else?
PATIENT: No, doctor. No medicine. I don't like taking pills. I tried some cough syrup once, a long time ago, but it didn't help. Made me sleepy. So, I just… try to rest when I can. My wife sometimes gives me hot tea with ginger. That helps a little, maybe. But no medicine, no. I don’t take anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. Careful, my back is a little sore today. But I can stand, yeah. How long do I need to stand for?
DOCTOR: Alright, just for a moment. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart. Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay, and again… Good. A few wheezes here and there, but nothing too concerning. And your heart sounds regular. Now, let's check your throat. Open wide and say “Ah.” Hmm, a little redness, but no obvious signs of infection. Now let’s take your temperature. 99.2 Fahrenheit. A little elevated. Now, can you tell me if you are experiencing any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Not really. Sometimes, when I run… or climb stairs… I get a little… puffed. But that’s normal, right? I don’t exercise much, I’m a tire repairman. I lift heavy things, but… not running. I don't get breathless just… sitting or walking slowly. But if I push myself too hard… yeah, a little bit. Mostly just tired then. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional shortness of breath with exertion. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have bronchitis, potentially triggered by your work environment and the previous flooding. The wheezing and redness in your throat support that. The elevated temperature is also consistent with an infection. However, given your lack of insurance and the rural location, I want to rule out anything more serious. Would you be open to getting a chest X-ray to be sure?
PATIENT: X-ray…? That sounds… expensive. I don’t have insurance, doctor. I don’t know if I can afford that. What would it show? Is it really necessary? It sounds serious… and I just have a cough, right? I just want to feel better. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe some stronger tea? Or medicine?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the cost. An X-ray would help us rule out pneumonia or anything else in the lungs, but I understand your concerns. We can try a course of antibiotics and see if that improves your symptoms. Given your history and the lack of high fever, I believe it's a reasonable first step. However, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – you need to seek immediate medical attention. I'll write you a prescription for a 7-day course of amoxicillin. And please, try to avoid dust as much as possible while you recover. Wear a mask at work if you can. I will also give you a written list of warning signs to look out for. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, antibiotics… that sounds better than an X-ray. A mask… I can try that. My wife can help. Warning signs… yeah, that’s good. A list is good. What if the antibiotics don't work? Then what do I do? And… how much do the antibiotics cost? I need to know if I can afford them.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question. If the antibiotics don’t improve your symptoms within 3-5 days, we need to reconsider. At that point, an X-ray would become much more important to rule out other causes. As for the cost, amoxicillin is a relatively inexpensive antibiotic. I would estimate around $20-$40, depending on the pharmacy. You can also call around to different pharmacies to compare prices. Here's the prescription and a list of warning signs to watch out for. If you experience any of those symptoms, or if your symptoms don’t improve after 5 days, please come back or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay, $20-$40… I think I can manage that. I will call around. And I will watch for the warning signs. Thank you, doctor. I feel a little better knowing what to do. I hope the medicine works. I should go now, I guess. My wife is waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Rest up, Mr. Tati, and take care. If anything changes, don’t hesitate to reach out.
