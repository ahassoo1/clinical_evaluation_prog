DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, I’ve gained a significant amount of weight recently, and I haven’t been able to figure out why. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A significant weight gain without a clear reason is concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s been approximately six months, starting around February, and I’d estimate… oh, let me think… roughly 20 pounds. Perhaps a little more. It’s not a gradual thing, it seems to come in waves, if that makes any sense. And it’s… it’s not from eating more, I assure you. I haven’t changed my diet at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, 20 pounds or so over the last six months, starting in February, and it feels like it's coming in waves even though your diet hasn't changed. That’s helpful information. And to clarify, when you say your diet hasn't changed, does that mean you haven't intentionally increased your calorie intake, or changed what you're eating?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. No intentional increases, and no changes to what I eat, Doctor. The same meals, the same portions… everything is as it has been for years. I eat mostly traditional Lithuanian food, you know—potatoes, dark bread, some meat, dairy… it’s quite… substantial, perhaps, but it’s what I’m used to. And it’s never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a consistent diet for years, consisting of traditional Lithuanian cuisine, and no changes to that. That's good to know. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me about your activity level?
PATIENT: Of course. I work as an orderly at a local hospital, so I’m on my feet quite a bit throughout the day—lifting patients, making beds, general tasks. It’s physically demanding, though not strenuous exercise, if that makes sense. And, truthfully, outside of work, I don’t do much. My husband and I… we prefer to relax at home. I don’t have a particular hobby that involves much movement.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically active job, but relatively sedentary outside of work. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I hadn't thought to mention it initially, but… I've been feeling quite fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And… this is perhaps strange, but my skin seems… drier. I’ve always had fairly normal skin, but now it’s constantly itchy and flaky, despite using moisturizer. And I’ve been feeling… colder than usual, even when the temperature is comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, dry skin, and feeling cold… those are all important things to note. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite… no, not really. It's the same as always. I eat when I’m hungry, and I don’t overeat. As for bowel habits… they’ve been… a little slower, perhaps. Not dramatically, but I’m not as… regular as I used to be. I wouldn’t say constipated, exactly, but… less frequent, certainly. It's not something I've been overly concerned about until now, with everything else happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent appetite, and slightly slower bowel movements. And to clarify, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s something I have noticed, now that you mention it. My ankles, especially, have been quite swollen at the end of the day. I thought it was just from being on my feet at work, but… it doesn’t go down as quickly as it used to. I usually elevate them when I get home, and it helps, but… it’s definitely more pronounced than it was before. I hadn't connected it to the weight gain, but perhaps it’s relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very relevant. Swelling in the ankles, along with the fatigue, dry skin, and weight gain, starts to paint a more complete picture. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing major, thankfully. I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that, but nothing serious. I've had no surgeries, and I’m not currently taking any medications. I see my dentist regularly, and I had a routine check-up with my primary care physician about two years ago, and everything was normal then. My husband, however… he has high blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No prior medical diagnoses, no surgeries, and no current medications. And your husband has a history of high blood pressure. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any other medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother, God rest her soul, had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And my father… he suffered from heart disease. He had a heart attack when he was in his late sixties. And… my aunt on my mother’s side, she had problems with her thyroid. She was always very tired and gained a lot of weight. She was eventually diagnosed with hypothyroidism, I think it was called. It's… it’s not a very healthy family, unfortunately. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. A family history of diabetes, heart disease, and hypothyroidism. Now, before I proceed with a physical examination, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always believed in living a healthy lifestyle, as much as possible. I find comfort in simple things, and I don't rely on anything like that. I hope that’s reassuring.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very reassuring. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm fortunate to say I don't have any allergies. I've never experienced an allergic reaction to anything – no food allergies, no medication sensitivities, and no environmental allergies like pollen or dust. I can eat whatever I want, and I'm generally fine with most things. I suppose I'm quite lucky in that regard. I haven't even had poison ivy! It's rather unusual, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's great to hear. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it’s necessary. I’m ready when you are. I do hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 145/90, pulse is 78 and regular, respiration is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Your lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished at the bases. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no nodules detected. Your abdomen is soft, and non-tender, but there's some mild swelling. Now I’m going to check your reflexes and test your strength. Your reflexes are normal and your strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Finally, I’ll examine your ankles and feet. You have noticeable pitting edema in both ankles. Okay, the exam reveals a slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished lung sounds, a mildly enlarged thyroid, mild abdominal swelling, and pitting edema in your ankles. These findings, along with your reported symptoms and family history, are concerning.
PATIENT: That… sounds rather worrying, Doctor. What does all of that mean? Is it something serious? The edema… I assumed it was just from being on my feet all day, but… a mildly enlarged thyroid… and diminished lung sounds? I’m getting quite anxious now, truthfully. Is it possible it’s just… stress? Or something simple? I do apologize for being so… emotional. I just… I don’t want it to be something terrible.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’re anxious, Reneisha. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. While it’s impossible to say definitively without further testing, the combination of your symptoms – weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, cold intolerance, swelling – along with the exam findings, strongly suggests a possible issue with your thyroid gland. The diminished lung sounds could be related to fluid buildup, potentially linked to the thyroid issue or other underlying causes. It’s less likely to be solely stress, though stress can certainly exacerbate some symptoms. However, the physical exam findings point towards a more systemic issue. The mild enlargement of your thyroid, combined with the edema, is concerning for hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid. To confirm this, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, we'll check your TSH , T4 , and T3 levels, as well as a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your thyroid function and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be absolutely alright. Blood tests sound… sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, and not dismissing my concerns. Hypothyroidism… is that… treatable? And is it… serious, if left untreated? I understand you can’t give me a diagnosis yet, but… I’m trying to prepare myself, you see. And… what does this mean for my work? I can’t afford to be off for long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It's my job to help you understand what's going on, and to alleviate your anxiety as much as possible. Yes, hypothyroidism is very treatable. The standard treatment is a synthetic thyroid hormone medication, levothyroxine, which replaces the hormone your thyroid isn't producing. It's a relatively simple medication to take, and most people respond very well to it. However, untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a number of complications. These include weight gain, fatigue, constipation, muscle weakness, depression, and in severe cases, heart problems. It can also worsen existing conditions, like high blood pressure. As for your work, that’s a valid concern. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly, and treatment can often help you manage them effectively and continue working. We'll need to see the results of the blood tests to determine the best course of action. If you are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, we can discuss potential accommodations at work if needed, and I can provide a note for your employer if you require one. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll write you a requisition form. You can get these done at [Name of local lab]. They'll send the results directly to me, and I'll contact you as soon as I have them, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so, Doctor. That was… very thorough, and reassuring, despite the… worrying possibilities. I appreciate your patience and kindness. [Name of local lab]… I’ll go there first thing tomorrow morning. And thank you for offering the note for my employer. It’s good to know that’s an option. I feel… a little less anxious now, knowing there’s a path forward. Thank you again, Doctor Andraca.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before I get the results. I’ll be in touch soon.
