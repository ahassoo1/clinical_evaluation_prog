DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I have... problem with my ear. Some liquid come out. It is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing some discharge from your ear. That's certainly not ideal. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It start... maybe three days ago? I wake up and my pillow... little wet. And then I look and... liquid. Clear liquid, but now... little bit yellow. Not much pain, but... feel full. Like ear is block.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started about three days ago, you noticed some clear liquid on your pillow, and now it's a bit yellow. You’re not experiencing much pain, but it feels full and blocked. That gives me a good starting point. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ears along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Hearing... yes, little bit. Not so good when people speak soft. Like... muffled. Ringing... no. Not ringing. Just... hard to hear quiet sounds. Like television too low.
DOCTOR: Okay, so muffled hearing, particularly with quieter sounds, and no ringing. Have you had any fever, chills, or any dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. And... no dizziness. I feel... normal, except for ear. I eat good. I sleep good. Just ear is trouble.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any ear infections before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was young boy... many earaches. Doctor give me drops. Yellow drops, I think. But... long time ago. I not remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of ear infections in childhood, treated with ear drops. Do you recall if you’ve had any recent colds, sinus infections, or any recent trauma to your ear – perhaps bumping your head or getting water in your ear?
PATIENT: No cold. No sinus... what you say? Sinus? No problem. And... no bump. No water. I not swim. I be careful. Just... ear. It start by itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to have started on its own, without any apparent cause. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Look at ear. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm just going to use this instrument, called an otoscope, to look inside your ear canal. It doesn't go in very far, and it shouldn't cause any discomfort. Just let me know if you feel anything sharp or painful. Okay… I see some cerumen, which is earwax, and the ear canal appears a bit inflamed. The eardrum itself looks…slightly bulging and a little bit cloudy. There's some yellowish discharge present as well. Based on what you've told me and what I’m seeing, it appears you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa. The inflammation and discharge are consistent with that. The bulging eardrum is something we need to keep an eye on, though. It could suggest a middle ear infection as well, but it’s more likely related to the inflammation from the outer ear infection. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never have allergy. I take no medicine. Except... sometimes for my blood pressure. Small white pill. But not now. I not take today.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and you take medication for blood pressure occasionally, but not today. That's good to know. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, I'd like to prescribe you some ear drops to treat the infection. These are antibiotic ear drops, and they should help to clear up the inflammation and discharge. It's important to use them exactly as directed, even if your symptoms start to improve before you finish the course. I'm also going to recommend that you keep your ear dry. Avoid swimming or getting water in your ear until the infection has completely cleared. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound good. Ear drops... okay. Keep ear dry... I can do that. No swimming. I not swim much anyway. How long... how long I need to use drops? And... what if it not get better?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad that works for you. You’ll use the ear drops twice a day for seven days. It’s important to complete the full course, even if your symptoms improve before then. If your symptoms don't start to improve within three to five days, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment. We may need to consider other options, or refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further evaluation. Are you experiencing any pain at the moment?
PATIENT: No pain. Like... pressure. Little bit stuffy. But no hurt. I can hear okay, but... muffled. Seven days... twice a day... I write down. So I not forget. You have paper?
DOCTOR: Excellent idea to write it down. Here’s a piece of paper, and I’ll jot down the instructions for you. Here you go. Along with the instructions, I’m also going to provide you with a prescription for the ear drops themselves. You can take this to your pharmacy, and they’ll be able to fill it for you. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think... I think that is all. You have been very helpful. Thank you very much. I write down everything. I will keep ear dry. And use drops.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any worsening of symptoms, or if you develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. We’ll see you if there’s no improvement in three to five days. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Radillo. Take care. .
