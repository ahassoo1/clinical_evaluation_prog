DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina Ambris. Eighteen years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s my breath. It smells…bad. Really bad. I just need something to fix it, quickly. I don’t have time for a whole life story.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. “Bad breath.” We can certainly address that. Though, simply fixing it often requires understanding why it’s happening. But, fine. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? A while. Months, probably. I don’t really pay attention to things like that. It’s not like I'm trying to impress anyone. It just…is. And it's getting worse, which is why I bothered coming here. Look, is it something serious? Because if it is, I really don’t want to hear about it.
DOCTOR: “Serious” is relative, of course. Bad breath, or halitosis, can be caused by a number of things. Poor oral hygiene is common, but it can also indicate other issues. Have you been brushing and flossing regularly?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, obviously. Do you think I just…don't brush? I mean, I do it when I remember. Look, I work on the highway, okay? It's not like I'm sitting around with time to floss after every meal. Sometimes I just rinse my mouth with water. Is that not enough?
DOCTOR: “Enough” depends on the bacteria present. Highway work… that's… dusty. Do you notice any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Look, my breath smells bad, okay? That’s the symptom. I don’t get a rash, or… I don’t know. Do I need to list everything that doesn’t happen? It just smells. And people… well, you get the idea. It’s embarrassing. Is it something I need antibiotics for? Because I really can't be missing work.
DOCTOR: Antibiotics aren't always the answer. Let's try to be a little systematic here. Do you have any pain in your mouth, any sores, or bleeding gums?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Nothing. It just smells. Look, is this going to take long? I have a shift starting in…well, not a lot of time. I already took time off for this, and my boss isn't exactly understanding. Just give me something to make it stop. A mouthwash, a pill, something.
DOCTOR: Alright. I need to examine your mouth. It's standard procedure. Open wide. And please, try to remain still. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Just hurry up, please. It’s not exactly a pleasant experience, you know. And don’t judge my teeth, okay? I don't have time for lectures.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Gums are slightly inflamed, but no obvious cavities. Tongue appears coated. Your breath is noticeably unpleasant. I’m going to document these findings. Inflamed gingiva, coated tongue, halitosis noted. It seems your oral hygiene could use some improvement. I’m going to recommend a high-fluoride toothpaste and an antibacterial mouthwash. Use them twice daily. And honestly, more regular dental visits are strongly advised. Perhaps every six months.
PATIENT: So… that’s it? Toothpaste and mouthwash? I really doubt that'll do anything. I've tried mouthwash before, it doesn't last. Look, are you sure there's nothing else? Like, some kind of spray or something stronger? Honestly, I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: There's also the possibility of underlying issues. Sinus infection, acid reflux… even certain medications can cause bad breath. But, given your situation, and the lack of other symptoms, we'll start with the basics. If this doesn't resolve the issue within a week, then we can consider further investigation. A referral to a dentist is also highly recommended. Do you have a dentist?
PATIENT: A dentist? No. Never had one. Honestly, I don’t even know where to start. Look, I just need something now. Is this mouthwash available at the pharmacy? And does it taste awful? Because if it does, I’m not using it. Seriously, I’ve had a long day.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a prescription for a chlorhexidine mouthwash. It can stain your teeth if used long-term, so follow the instructions carefully. It does have a somewhat metallic taste, but it's effective. Available at most pharmacies. And frankly, if your work environment is as dusty as you say, avoiding sugary drinks and snacks would also be beneficial. Sugary foods contribute to bacterial growth. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Look, metallic taste? Great. Just what I needed. Fine. No. No further questions. Just… thank you. I guess. Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Go. And seriously, consider a dentist. Some people… Honestly. .
