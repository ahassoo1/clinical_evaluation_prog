DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Pipolo. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Hello Doctor. My eyes... they feel dry. Real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Not fun. Just wanted to see if somethin' could be done 'bout it.
DOCTOR: Dry eyes, you say. And for how long has this dryness been bothering you, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Maybe… six months? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda slips away when you get old, you know? It's not always bad, but most days they feel scratchy. Especially when the wind blows. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: Six months... I see. And would you describe it as a burning sensation, or more of an…irritating grittiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… grittiness, I think. Like there's sand in 'em. Not burnin', not really. Just… uncomfortable. Makes me blink a lot. And sometimes my vision gets kinda blurry, but not for long. It's mostly just annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the dryness and occasional blurriness?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the dry and the blurry sometimes. No pain, no… discharge or anything like that. Just feels old, I guess. Like my eyes are as worn out as the rest of me. Is this gonna take long, Doctor? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Well, we do need to ascertain the cause of the dryness, Mr. Pipolo. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, even if it is simply age-related. Now, have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for this dryness?
PATIENT: Remedies? Like… drops? Yeah, I think my niece gave me some once. Little bottle. Didn't really do much, if I remember right. Just made my eyes wet for a minute. Didn't fix the scratchy feelin'. I don't use much of anything, to be honest. Don't really trust that stuff.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Pipolo?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been much for pills. Try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fish, walk around a bit. That's about it. Don't need much help from doctors, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a quick examination of your eyes, if you don’t mind. Just to check for any obvious issues and assess the severity of the dryness. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Get it over with, then. I got wood to chop. Just be gentle, alright? Old eyes ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pipolo. Please look straight ahead. Hmm… some mild conjunctival injection present bilaterally. Corneal surfaces appear relatively clear, though there is some evidence of punctate erosions… Tear production is somewhat diminished, as expected. It appears you do have moderate dry eye, Mr. Pipolo. Not unexpected given your age and reported symptoms.
PATIENT: Moderate? What's that mean? Like, is it bad? I just want somethin' to make 'em stop feelin' like sandpaper. And will I go blind or somethin'? Don't tell me I need surgery.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pipolo, it does not mean you will go blind. Please do not jump to conclusions. Moderate simply indicates the level of severity. It is manageable, generally. We can begin with artificial tears—preservative-free, I recommend—four times daily. I will write you a prescription. We can also consider a mild ocular lubricant ointment to use at bedtime. It’s important to stay hydrated, and I would recommend avoiding prolonged exposure to wind if possible. We can re-evaluate in a month to see if these measures are sufficient. Do you have any allergies to eye drops or medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had no allergies. Just a little sensitive to the cold. Alright, drops and ointment. Sounds… alright, I guess. Is this all I gotta do? Can I go chop my wood now? I'm losin' daylight.
DOCTOR: For now, yes, Mr. Pipolo. That will be sufficient. I will send the prescription to your usual pharmacy. However, should your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any pain, redness, or changes in vision, you must contact me immediately. It’s essential to rule out any underlying complications. Here is a written summary of the instructions, as well as information about potential warning signs. I trust you will follow these recommendations carefully. Now, please feel free to go and attend to your wood. Good day, Mr. Pipolo.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I got it. Drops, ointment, don't get sand in my eyes, and call if somethin' goes wrong. Thank you, Doctor. I'm outta here. .
