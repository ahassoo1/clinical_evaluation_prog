DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be perfectly honest. I don't usually bother doctors with… this sort of thing, but it’s been going on for a bit now. It’s… a discharge. From my… husband. Though he couldn’t be bothered to come himself. Men. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Um… just to clarify, you’re saying you are experiencing a discharge?
PATIENT: No, no, not me, Doctor! Heavens, no! It's my… companion. Harold. He's… well, he’s had it. A discharge. From… down there. It’s rather unpleasant, I assure you. And frankly, unhygienic. It’s been… seeping. That’s the word, isn't it? Seeping.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So Harold is experiencing a discharge. And you’ve noticed this… recently?
PATIENT: Yes, quite recently. A few weeks now, I’d say. Though he’s been… less forthcoming about the details, if you understand me. Men and their… pride, you know? He just grumbles and says it’s “nothing.” But I noticed the… staining. On his trousers. Really, the lack of basic cleanliness is appalling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And you’re bringing this to my attention because you’re concerned about Harold’s health, and the… staining you’ve observed. Just to be clear, what does the discharge look like?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’m not one to examine… those parts of a man. Goodness, no! But it's… yellowish, I think. And a bit… thick. Not like water, certainly. More like… custard, gone bad. Though I wouldn't know for sure, I don’t go poking around! And there's a rather… distinct odor. Not pleasant at all. Honestly, the whole situation is terribly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that description, that's helpful. Has Harold experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, he's been a bit… irritable, I suppose. More so than usual. Complaining of aches and pains, but he always complains of aches and pains. And he's been… frequenting the little boy’s room rather often, if you catch my drift. But frankly, Doctor, with his diet, that’s hardly surprising. Too much sherry, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better understanding of what’s going on with Harold, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will involve listening to his heart and lungs, and then a brief examination of the affected area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: You want to… examine him? Here? In front of me? Doctor, that’s simply not done! Honestly, the impropriety of it all! Harold would never allow it. And I certainly wouldn’t dream of watching! It’s… indecent! I brought him here for advice, not a… a stripping exhibition!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mrs. Wartick. That was… not what I meant at all. I apologize for the misunderstanding. What I meant was, it would be best for Harold to come in himself for a proper examination. I won't examine him with you present. It’s important for him to be comfortable and for me to have a private consultation to discuss his symptoms fully. I can schedule an appointment for him as soon as possible. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s much better, Doctor. Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. He'll probably grumble about it, but it's the proper thing to do. Honestly, men. They never want to admit when something is wrong. Just tell me, will it be a long appointment? He has his dominoes evening on Thursdays, and he’d be furious if he missed that.
DOCTOR: I’m scheduling him for Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM. It shouldn't take longer than thirty to forty-five minutes. We'll need to take a detailed history and perform a physical exam. Depending on the findings, we may need to order some lab tests. Is that acceptable, Mrs. Wartick?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Though I do hope he won’t be too inconvenienced. Dominoes is very important to him, you know. And please, Doctor, try to be… discreet. I wouldn’t want the neighbors gossiping. Honestly, the thought of it!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Wartick. I understand your concerns completely, and I assure you everything will be handled with the utmost discretion. I'll also give him a note for work, explaining any potential absences. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… please, do try to get to the bottom of this quickly. It’s terribly unsettling, and I’m afraid Harold is becoming quite… grumpy about it. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Wartick. We’ll do our best to help Harold get back to feeling his best. We have his appointment scheduled for Thursday at 2:00 PM. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. You too. And thank you again for… understanding.
