DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinus, it feels… bad. It’s been bothering me. I don't really... remember how long. A while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Bad” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… full? Like there's a lot of pressure. And sometimes it hurts, over my eyes and cheeks. Not a bad, bad pain, just… uncomfortable. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Pressure and discomfort are good ways to describe it. And where exactly are you feeling this pressure – is it both sides of your face, or just one?
PATIENT: Both sides, I think. Yes, both. But… maybe a little worse on this side? <points to her left cheek> It feels… stuffy too. Like when you have a cold, but… not exactly like a cold. I haven't been sick, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pressure and stuffiness on both sides, a little worse on the left, and not feeling generally sick like with a cold. Do you have any drainage from your nose?
PATIENT: Drainage… sometimes. Not a lot. Clear, mostly. Sometimes a little yellow, but not often. It doesn't really… bother me too much. I just wipe it away. It’s not… constant. Is that important? I forget things easily, so maybe I don’t notice when it happens.
DOCTOR: It is important, thank you for telling me. And it's perfectly alright to forget things; we can work around that. So, clear or yellowish drainage sometimes, not constant. Do you have any fever, cough, or sore throat?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And no cough. My throat… sometimes a little scratchy, but that could be from… the air? It's been hot lately. I don’t think it’s a bad sore throat. Nothing like when I was a little girl. I don't remember much, but… I think I don’t have a fever. I haven’t felt hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough, just a little scratchy throat sometimes. And you said this has been going on for a while, but you're unsure how long… Has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I tried… drinking water? And maybe… resting? But it doesn't seem to change much. It’s just… there. It’s not getting worse, I don't think, but it’s not going away either. It’s… frustrating. I forget if I've tried anything else. My husband, he… he probably remembers.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no real relief with water or rest, and it's been stable for an unknown amount of time. We'll try not to worry about what you've already tried. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t know. I don’t think so. I’ve never… been told I have them. Maybe I’m allergic to something outside? I work with… machines. Lots of dust and… things. But I don’t sneeze a lot. I don't really know. Sorry. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s perfectly fine. We can try to figure it out. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medicine. I try to stay away from it, if I can. I had… a problem, a long time ago. And I don’t like taking pills. Nothing regular. Only if I really need it. My husband, he takes some things for his… pressure. But not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And you had a problem in the past that makes you hesitant to take medication – thank you for letting me know. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… a baby, a long time ago. That was a surgery. A C-section. And I think… I was sick with something when I was younger. A fever, very high. I was in the hospital. But that was a long, long time ago. I don’t remember much else. My husband would know better. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a C-section in the past, and a childhood illness with a high fever. Do you know if you have any medical conditions – like asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Nobody ever told me I have those things. I… I work hard, outside. Lifting and… things. I'm pretty strong, I think. I haven’t been told I have any of those problems. I hope I don’t! It sounds… bad. My husband is healthy, mostly. He has some… aches and pains, from working. But not those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions. And just one last thing before we do a quick exam: Do any family members have similar sinus problems or allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she used to get headaches a lot. And she always had a tissue with her. Maybe that was… sinus? I'm not sure. My husband’s side… I don’t know. We didn’t talk about it much. I’m not very close to his family. Sorry, I wish I could tell you more. It's hard to remember all of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had frequent headaches, possibly sinus-related. Thank you. Alright, that gives me a good start. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and take a look at your sinuses and throat, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust you. Whatever you think is best. Just… please be gentle? My throat is a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be. First, let's listen to your lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Another deep breath… and out… Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to look at your sinuses. I'll use a light to get a better look. There's some tenderness over your left cheek, as you mentioned. Now, open your mouth for me, and say "Ah." Your throat is a little red, but no signs of anything major. I don’t see any swelling or pus.
PATIENT: Okay. It doesn’t hurt too bad when you touch it. Just… pressure. My throat feels a little scratchy. What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it… bad? I get worried easily, sometimes. Especially when I can’t remember things.
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know you get worried easily. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds most likely like you have sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses. It can be caused by a number of things, including allergies, a cold, or just changes in the air. The redness in your throat suggests some mild irritation as well. It doesn't seem to be a severe infection, but it is causing you discomfort. The fact you can't pinpoint when it started and are unsure of triggers suggests it could be chronic. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Sinusitis… yes, I think so. Inflammation… that sounds right. Like… swollen? And it can just… happen? Not from something specific? And chronic means… it stays for a long time? <frowns slightly> That doesn’t sound good. Is there anything I can do about it? I really don’t want to take pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Yes, swollen is a good way to think about it. And it can happen for a lot of reasons, or sometimes no obvious reason at all. Chronic means it lasts for longer than 12 weeks, or keeps coming back. But don't worry, there are things we can try! Since you prefer to avoid medication, let’s start with some conservative measures. I recommend saline nasal rinses twice a day. It helps to clear out the nasal passages and reduce inflammation. You can find saline spray or a rinse kit at most pharmacies. Also, drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – can help thin the mucus. A humidifier, especially at night, can also provide some relief. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Saline rinse… I think I’ve seen that before. And drinking water, I can do that. I always have a bottle with me. And a humidifier… my husband can probably get that. He’s good with things like that. <nods slowly> It doesn't sound too bad. How long do I have to do it? Before I see if it helps?
DOCTOR: Good. It's great you have support from your husband. Let's try these measures for two weeks. If you’re not noticing any improvement after two weeks – or if your symptoms worsen – then we can discuss other options, including a possible referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to do the saline rinse properly. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Two weeks… and if it gets worse, I see someone else. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I forget things so easily, I worry I don’t explain myself well. <smiles faintly>
DOCTOR: You explained everything perfectly, and you're very welcome. It’s my job to be patient. Remember, if you have any concerns at all before your next appointment – even if it’s just a small question – please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s the handout and my card. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Mikeisha.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You too. .
