DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Yadao. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you are 66 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, 66. August 2nd, isn’t it? Lovely weather we're having. Well, to be honest, I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a while. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe three.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd it is. And yes, quite pleasant weather. Difficult to start, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It feels like… I have to push a little, even when I don’t feel like I need to. And then it's… weak, the stream, not very strong. It’s embarrassing to talk about, really. I haven’t told anyone. Not my friends, not my daughter. She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a sensitive topic, Mrs. Yadao. Pushing, and a weak stream… Hmm. And this has been occurring for approximately three weeks now?
PATIENT: About three weeks, yes. Maybe a little longer. It came on gradually, not all at once. At first I just thought I was drinking too much tea before bed, you know? But even when I cut back, it didn’t really get much better. I do drink a lot of tea, though. Black tea, with a little bit of sugar. I’ve been drinking it since I was a little girl, back in Lithuania. It’s a habit.
DOCTOR: Lithuania… yes. Black tea, with sugar. It's good to be aware of habits. Now, beyond the difficulty initiating and the weakness of the stream, are you experiencing any other urinary symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel like I still need to go, even after I’ve just been. Like, there's a little bit left in there, you know? Not much, but enough to be annoying. And… and I wake up a couple of times a night to go to the bathroom. It wasn’t always like that. I used to sleep right through. It’s not every night, but a few times a week, at least. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite clear, Mrs. Yadao. A sensation of incomplete emptying and nocturia – waking up to urinate. Hmm. Now, have you noticed any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning at all. It’s not painful, just… frustrating. And a bit inconvenient. I have to plan everything around it, you know? Before going anywhere, I have to make sure I’ve been to the bathroom recently. It’s silly, but it’s true. And… and sometimes, when I try to go, it just… dribbles. A little bit. It’s very embarrassing. I’m glad you’re listening. It’s nice to finally talk about it.
DOCTOR: It's important to discuss these things, Mrs. Yadao. "Dribbling" after voiding… yes. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. Mostly just a little stiffness in the mornings. And… and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for years now. I take a small pill every day. I think that's everything. Oh! And I had a very bad flu last winter. I was in bed for a week! But that’s not a medical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis, hypertension… and the influenza. Yes, all relevant, Mrs. Yadao. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s a small white pill. I get it refilled every month at the drugstore. The bottle says… … Lisinopril, I think? Yes, Lisinopril. That’s it. I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe ten years now? It helps a lot. My daughter reminds me to take it every morning. She's very good like that.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mrs. Yadao, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not to my knowledge, anyway. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years! My daughter always asks, but I haven't ever had a reaction to anything. No trouble with penicillin, no trouble with bee stings, nothing like that. I'm very lucky, I think. I’ve always been quite healthy, until this… this bathroom trouble started.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m a bit embarrassed about all this, but… I suppose it’s necessary. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I do have a bit of a sensitive back.
DOCTOR: We will proceed as gently as possible, Mrs. Yadao. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a neurological assessment, and I may need to perform a brief digital rectal exam. It is standard procedure for evaluating these symptoms. The rectal exam may cause some discomfort, but it should be minimal. Are you agreeable to proceeding?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh. Goodness. I… I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. It sounds… unpleasant. But… if it’s necessary, I suppose it has to be done. I just… I’m not very comfortable with that idea. But if you say it’s important, I trust you. Yes, alright. Let’s… let’s get it over with. But please be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Yadao. Please lie down on your back. We will begin with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Deep breath… and exhale. Is that alright? I hope I’m not making a mess of things. It's been a long time since I've been examined like this. I always get a little nervous, you know? My heart starts to race. I try to relax, but it's difficult. Deep breath… and exhale.
DOCTOR: Your bowel sounds are normal, Mrs. Yadao. I’m now going to palpate your abdomen – gently press on your belly. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. A little tender there, on the left side. But it's not too bad. Just a little… sensitive. I think it might be from the flu I had last winter. I was coughing so much, I think I strained something. Deep breath… and exhale. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness in the left flank, as you say. Now, I am going to assess your neurological function. This will involve some simple tests to check your reflexes and sensation. First, I'd like you to close your eyes and tell me when I touch your legs.
PATIENT: Alright. Closed my eyes. Touch my legs, you say? This feels a little strange, but I’m doing my best to cooperate. I hope I don’t jump or anything! Just tell me when you touch them, is that right? Deep breath… and exhale. Here I am, ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you point your toes and flex your feet?
PATIENT: Like this? Yes, I can do that. A little stiff, but I can do it. My arthritis sometimes makes it a little difficult to move my joints. But it’s not too bad. Is that alright? Deep breath… and exhale. I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, we will proceed with the digital rectal exam. I've explained the procedure, Mrs. Yadao, and understand it may be uncomfortable. Please bear with me. I’ll let you know when I’m beginning.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just… just get it over with. But please be gentle, Doctor. Very, very gentle. I’m ready… I think. Deep breath… and exhale.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao. I am now going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to assess the prostate for size and consistency, and to check for any masses or tenderness. This may cause some pressure, but it should not be painful. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That’s… not very comfortable. It feels… strange. Just… just get it over with. Hurry, please. Deep breath… and exhale. I’m trying, Doctor, I really am. But it’s… unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Yadao. That is all for the physical examination. I apologize for any discomfort this may have caused. Now, based on your history and physical exam, the most likely cause of your symptoms is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men, and it involves an enlargement of the prostate gland, which can obstruct the flow of urine.
PATIENT: BPH? But… I’m a woman. You said it’s common in men. What does that mean? I don't have a prostate, do I? I'm very confused now. What's going on?
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mrs. Yadao. That was a… lapse in my concentration. A regrettable error. What I meant to say is, your symptoms are suggestive of an enlarged bladder, potentially with detrusor muscle dysfunction. It's not uncommon in women of your age, and it can cause similar difficulties with urination. We will need to perform some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis. Specifically, I would like to order a urinalysis, a urine culture, and a post-void residual volume measurement. This will involve a simple ultrasound after you urinate.
PATIENT: An enlarged bladder… That sounds better than a prostate, at least. Ultrasound, you say? After I go to the bathroom? Alright, I suppose that makes sense. Will it be… uncomfortable? I do worry about these things. And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I just want to know what’s going on and get it fixed, you know? I'm tired of worrying about this.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive, Mrs. Yadao, and it should not be uncomfortable at all. It's similar to a pregnancy scan, and it simply creates an image of your bladder to measure the amount of urine remaining after you void. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to 8 glasses of water per day, unless you have any other medical conditions that restrict your fluid intake. This slip has the instructions for the lab. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include behavioral therapy, medication, or in some cases, a referral to a urologist. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… I suppose I can manage that. It's a lot, but I can try. And no other medical conditions, thankfully. Behavioral therapy… that sounds… strange. Is that like… retraining my bladder? And what kind of medication? I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. And a urologist… that sounds serious. Is it that bad? I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Behavioral therapy involves techniques to help you control your bladder and reduce urinary urgency. It's not as daunting as it sounds – it involves simple exercises and lifestyle modifications. The medication we may consider, if necessary, is an anticholinergic – it helps to relax the bladder muscle and reduce urinary frequency. It does have potential side effects, which we would discuss thoroughly before starting it. As for the urologist, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Mrs. Yadao. It simply means a specialist in the urinary system. If your symptoms don’t improve with initial treatment, or if we find any abnormalities on the tests, a referral may be warranted. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We will start with the tests and see what the results show. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Just… the tests, then we see. And try to drink more water. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it's a little scary. I hope it's nothing too serious. I suppose I'll go home now and try to relax. And drink more water. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Yadao. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition. Have a pleasant day.
