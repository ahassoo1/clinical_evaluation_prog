DOCTOR: Alright, Moshe, have a seat. So, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Havird. It’s… it’s the sleepiness, really. Even with the machine. I use it every night, like a good patient, but I’m still dragging during the day. It’s just… tiring, you know? Especially at my age. I feel like I should be enjoying my retirement a little more than… well, than napping.
DOCTOR: The machine… you mean your CPAP?
PATIENT: Yes, the CPAP. That’s the one. They fitted me for it about… oh, let me think… five years ago now, I suppose. A bit longer, maybe. It helped at first, definitely. I wasn’t waking up gasping for air anymore, which was wonderful. But lately… it feels like it’s not doing the whole job, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. I still feel… foggy, and just plain sleepy, all day long. Even after a full night with the mask on.
DOCTOR: Right. Foggy. And you’re saying this has been… gradual?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. It didn't just happen overnight. For the first couple of years, it was fantastic. I could actually enjoy a movie without dozing off! But then, little by little, the tiredness crept back. At first, I thought it was just… getting older. But it’s more than that, I think. It’s like the machine isn't… strong enough, maybe? Or maybe I’m not using it right? I don’t know. I’ve tried adjusting the settings a little, but I’m afraid of messing things up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said you've adjusted the settings… can you tell me how you adjusted them?
PATIENT: Well, it was just the ramp-up setting, mostly. You know, how quickly it increases the pressure when you turn it on. I found if I started too fast, it was uncomfortable. So I lowered it a bit, made it slower. And then, I think I might have increased the overall pressure a tiny bit, just a click or two. But I didn't really mean to, I was just fiddling with it, trying to find a sweet spot. I realize now that probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do. Everything feels a bit complicated, and I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the sleepiness, anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. I don’t wake up with a dry mouth anymore, which was a problem at the beginning, but that sorted itself out with a different mask. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to complain about the noise, but that’s neither here nor there now. Just the tiredness, mostly. It makes it hard to concentrate. I used to love reading, but now I find myself rereading the same page several times. And I get frustrated easily, which isn’t very pleasant for anyone. It’s… it’s a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any snoring?
PATIENT: Snoring? That's a good question. Not that I’m aware of. I mean, I’m asleep when it happens! My ex-wife used to say I snored like a freight train before I got the machine, but… well, she also said a lot of things. I haven’t lived with anyone for a few years now, so I really have no idea. I suppose it’s possible, but I haven’t noticed it myself. Is that important, Doctor? Does snoring mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: It can be. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can talk about maybe getting a sleep study repeated. It's been five years, after all. Things change.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. A sleep study… alright. That’s not a problem. I’m not particularly fond of sleeping in a lab, but if it helps, I’m willing to do it. I trust your judgment. Lead the way, so to speak. I’d just like to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s exhausting being this tired all the time. Honestly, it’s a bit of a drag.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse, then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll take a look at your throat. Nothing too invasive, just routine.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I always used to be a bit nervous at the doctor, but I’m getting old enough that I figure what’s going to happen is going to happen. My knees aren't what they used to be, I’m afraid. But I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, open wide and say "ah." Throat looks normal. No obvious signs of obstruction.
PATIENT: “Ahhh.” There. Is that alright? Everything feels a bit dry, to be honest. I drink a lot of coffee, you see. Perhaps that’s contributing to the problem. Is something wrong, Doctor? You seem to be… concentrating.
DOCTOR: No, no. Nothing wrong. Just… a slightly dry pharynx. As you said, the coffee. And a bit of mild inflammation, probably from post-nasal drip. It’s not significant. Now, let's talk about this CPAP machine. Can you describe the mask you're using?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That's good to know. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. I get colds easily, and my nose always feels a bit stuffy. As for the mask… it’s a full face mask, I believe. It covers my nose and mouth. It's a ResMed, I think. They gave it to me when I first got the machine. It's… well, it's a bit bulky, to be honest. And it leaves marks on my face in the morning. But it’s the one they recommended, and I haven't really thought about trying a different one. It gets the job done, mostly. Or it used to, anyway. I've seen advertisements for smaller masks, but they seemed… complicated.
DOCTOR: A full face mask… and you've been using it for five years. Hmmm. And you haven't had it checked or cleaned regularly?
PATIENT: Checked? Well, I bring it in for a cleaning when the machine tells me to. It has a little display that reminds me. And I wipe it down with a damp cloth every day, as instructed. But… checked by a professional? No, I haven’t. I just assumed it was fine. I mean, it’s working, isn’t it? Or it was working. I suppose I should have asked, but I didn’t really think about it. They just gave it to me and told me how to use it. I'm not very good with these things, you see. I leave the car repairs to the mechanics and the medical stuff to the doctors. That's just me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that explains a lot. It's possible the mask isn't fitting properly anymore, or that it's simply worn out. A poor mask fit can cause air leaks, which reduces the effectiveness of the therapy and can lead to discomfort. And a worn-out cushion can cause skin irritation. We need to get you a properly fitted mask. And frankly, I'm concerned about the possible underlying causes of your continued sleepiness. I'm going to order a repeat sleep study, and I'm going to refer you to a sleep specialist.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A sleep specialist, you say? Alright. If that’s what you recommend, I trust your judgment. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this properly. It’s just… tiring, you know? Being this tired all the time. I suppose it’s good to finally have some answers, or at least, a plan to find them. When can I schedule the sleep study? And… what should I expect? It’s been a long time since I've been in one of those places.
DOCTOR: I’ll have my nurse schedule the sleep study for you. It's at the Sleep Center downtown. They'll monitor your brain waves, breathing, and heart rate overnight. It's not as bad as it sounds. You'll be in a private room, and they'll attach sensors to your head and body. It's important to bring your CPAP machine and mask. The sleep specialist will review the results and recommend a course of treatment. As for what to expect… mostly, just try to relax and sleep as you normally would. Do you have any questions about the study itself?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Relax and sleep normally… that’s easier said than done, frankly. But I’ll try. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. And for the referral. I appreciate it. Will the sleep specialist be able to tell me if there's something else wrong? Something beyond just the mask? I worry sometimes… about my memory, you know. It's not what it used to be. It’s probably just old age, but… it's good to rule things out.
DOCTOR: The sleep specialist will evaluate all potential causes of your sleepiness, including the possibility of other underlying conditions. They may recommend further testing, such as a neurological evaluation, if they suspect a problem with your memory or cognition. It’s good that you’re bringing this up. It’s always best to be thorough. Now, let me give you a prescription for a new CPAP mask, and we'll get you scheduled for the study. And I’ll have my nurse give you a list of sleep hygiene tips to help you prepare. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Thank you. A new mask, the study, the specialist… it’s a lot, but I feel… hopeful, actually. It’s good to know someone is taking this seriously. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ve seen enough doctors over the years to know a good one when I meet one. And you, Doctor Havird, are a good one. I suppose there's nothing more to do for now, is there? Just scheduling and waiting, then?
DOCTOR: That’s right. Scheduling and waiting. My nurse will contact you to arrange the appointments. And if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to call the office. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Moshe. And try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I’ll try.
