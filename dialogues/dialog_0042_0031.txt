DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. And I know I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctors told me it’s called… atrial… fibrillation? Something like that. It’s the leg that’s the main worry right now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in the left leg and a history of atrial fibrillation. Thank you for letting me know. Let’s start with the leg. Can you tell me when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness. But it’s gotten worse each day. I noticed it properly on… July 26th, I think? Yes, that sounds right. I was wearing my usual shoes and they felt a bit tight.
DOCTOR: Alright, July 26th. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: Not that I’ve noticed, no. I haven't done anything different. I’ve been teaching my computer classes as usual. Standing a lot, but I always stand a lot. I haven’t tripped or bumped it, or anything like that. It just… got bigger. It doesn’t hurt particularly bad, just feels… heavy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Heavy. And is the swelling in your entire leg, or just a specific part of it – like your foot, ankle, or calf?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle is a bit puffy too. My foot isn’t too bad, thankfully. It’s definitely worse higher up, in the muscle part of my leg. It feels… tight there as well. Not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, calf and ankle, mostly. And you mentioned atrial fibrillation. Do you currently take any medication for that, Nixon?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take… a little blue pill, twice a day. I think it’s called… bisoprolol? Or something very similar. The doctor at the hospital gave it to me after they told me about the funny heartbeat. I’ve been taking it regularly, I promise. I try to remember, and I usually do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Bisoprolol, twice a day. That's good to know. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leg swelling and the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I have been a bit more tired than usual, if that counts. Just… feeling a bit run down. And… sometimes I feel a bit breathless when I walk up the stairs. But I thought that was just me being out of shape, to be honest. It’s not too bad, though. It doesn’t happen every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional shortness of breath. I want to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had a problem with any medicine. I’m quite careful about what I take, so I’m fairly sure I don’t have any allergies. I haven’t noticed anything, anyway.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions or surgeries that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago, but that’s about it. I haven’t been seriously ill, thankfully. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. I’m generally quite healthy, I think. My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. And what about your family?
PATIENT: What do you mean? Do you want to know if my family are well? My mother is still alive, she’s 80, and she’s quite fit for her age. My father passed away a few years ago, he had a bad heart. And my brother is fine, he lives in Canada. Does that help? Were you asking about heart problems?
DOCTOR: Yes, Nixon, that’s very helpful. Knowing your father had heart problems is important. Thank you. Now, just to finish up with some background, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I teach computer science at the local college, so I spend most of my day on my feet, or sitting at a computer. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but it’s not always easy when you're busy. I don’t get much time for exercise, unfortunately. I used to walk a lot more, but… well, life gets in the way, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Alright, Nixon. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to examine your leg. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it won’t be too uncomfortable. Is there anything I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Not at all. Just relax. Okay, I'm just going to feel around a bit now. I notice some mild swelling and warmth in your left calf, and a bit of tenderness when I press here. The pulses in your foot feel a little weaker than they should be, but I can still feel them. And there is some pitting edema – meaning the swelling leaves a little indent when I press on it. It's not severe, but it’s present. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs now, if that's okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Listening to my heart sounds good. It always feels a bit strange, but I understand you need to. It’s alright if it takes a minute. I do feel a bit… anxious, if I’m honest. I worry about my heart, you see. My father… well, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nixon. It's perfectly normal to be anxious, especially given your father's history. Okay, I'm listening now. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, which is consistent with your atrial fibrillation. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in a deep vein in your leg – combined with your existing atrial fibrillation. The swelling, warmth, tenderness, and weaker pulse are all suggestive of this. However, we need to confirm this with some further testing. I want to order a D-dimer test and a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg. The D-dimer is a blood test that can help rule out a blood clot, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins in your leg and confirm whether a clot is present. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot? That sounds… serious. Yes, of course, do whatever tests you think are necessary. A D-dimer and an… Doppler ultrasound, you said? Is it very painful? Will I need to stay in hospital? I do have classes tomorrow, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Nixon. It is serious, but we’re going to get to the bottom of it. A Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve needles or any cutting. It just uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg. It shouldn’t be painful at all – you might feel a little pressure from the probe, but that’s all. As for needing to stay in hospital, that depends on the results of the tests. If it is a blood clot, you will likely need treatment with blood thinners, and we may need to monitor you closely for a short time. We can discuss that in more detail once we have the results. I'm going to write a referral for those tests now. The clinic will schedule them for you. In the meantime, please avoid strenuous activity and try to elevate your left leg as much as possible. Also, if you experience any sudden chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, regardless of the time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. No strenuous activity, elevate my leg, and go to the emergency room if I have chest pain or trouble breathing. I can remember that. Blood thinners… that sounds a bit scary. Will I have to stop teaching? And will I be able to drive? Oh, and will it affect my… my computer work? I spend a lot of time sitting, but I do a lot of… moving the mouse. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. It’s a lot to take in, but I appreciate you being so thorough.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to have questions. Let's address your concerns one by one. Regarding blood thinners, there are different types, and some have fewer side effects than others. We'll choose the one that's best suited for you. As for stopping teaching, that depends on the severity of the clot and the type of treatment you receive. We may be able to modify your schedule to avoid strenuous activity, but we'll discuss that with the specialist. Regarding driving, it depends on the specific blood thinner you're prescribed and your individual risk factors. We'll provide you with clear guidelines on this. And as for your computer work, sitting and moving the mouse shouldn't be a problem, but we'll monitor you closely to make sure you're not experiencing any complications. I'm also going to write a note to your primary care physician, informing them of our findings and recommendations. And I'll provide you with a summary of our conversation and the referral information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. A note to my doctor, a summary… that’s helpful. Thank you. So, I just need to wait for the tests, then? And try not to worry too much? It’s easier said than done, I’m afraid. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little bit better now, knowing that we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. And yes, you just need to wait for the tests. Try to focus on elevating your leg and avoiding strenuous activity. It’s okay to be worried, but remember that we’re going to get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have the clinic staff print out the referral and summary for you now. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. Take care, Nixon. And please, keep me updated on your progress.
