DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I… I was told I have cancer. That’s why I’m here. I don’t… I don’t really know much about it yet.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be quite unsettling to hear, and it's perfectly alright if you don't have all the information right now. We'll work through this together. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me who told you about the cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: It was… my husband’s doctor. He passed away last month, and… and they were going through his records, and that’s when they found something on some tests he had. They said it showed up on a scan, and… and it seems I have it too. It’s… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Chellsea. Losing your husband must be incredibly difficult, and to receive news like this on top of everything… it’s understandable that it feels overwhelming. Just to clarify, his doctor mentioned you having a similar finding on a scan reviewed during the process of going through his records?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They said… they said it was in the paperwork from some tests I had a few months ago, too. I had them because… because I wasn’t feeling well. Just tired all the time, mostly. But it wasn’t anything serious, they said then. Or… that’s what I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me pull up those previous test results. Knowing when you had these tests and what specifically was looked at will be helpful. Just to confirm, you were feeling primarily fatigued a few months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly tired. And… a little achy, sometimes. Like after a hard workout, but I hadn’t had a workout. It wasn’t anything terrible, so I didn’t really think much of it. I just… I slowed down a bit, that’s all. It was around… April, I think? Maybe May?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see records from April and May here – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. They were both within normal limits at that time. Do you recall if any imaging was performed around then – an X-ray, CT scan, or MRI, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. No, I don’t remember getting any pictures taken. I just had some blood drawn. I definitely didn’t have anything with a machine or anything. I… I get nervous about those. I don’t like small spaces. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Knowing about your anxiety with enclosed spaces is helpful, and it explains why you would remember if imaging was done. It sounds like the initial concern wasn't investigated with a scan at that time. So, to clarify, the information about a potential cancer diagnosis came from reviewing records after your husband’s passing, and it was based on a scan that you didn't know about previously?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. I didn’t know about the scan at all. His doctor just… told me about it. Said it showed something, and I needed to come see someone. I… I don’t even know what kind of cancer it is. Or… where it is. I’m very confused.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion, Chellsea, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. It’s a lot to process. Let’s try to get some clarity. Do you happen to have any of the paperwork from your husband’s doctor – perhaps a summary of his findings, or a referral note?
PATIENT: I… I think so. I have a folder with everything. Let me see… Here it is. It’s… a lot of papers. I didn’t really look at it closely, to be honest. It was too upsetting. I… I just wanted to get here. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Absolutely, there is. If you could point me to any reports mentioning imaging – CT scans, MRIs, or even X-rays – that would be a great starting point. Or, anything specifically referencing the findings that led to the concern about cancer. Don't worry about reading through everything, just point out anything that looks like it might be relevant. We'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Okay… This one. It’s… it’s a report from a CT scan. It says… “incidental finding in the left lung.” And there’s a date… July 15th. I… I don’t remember ever having a CT scan on July 15th. This must be… the one they were talking about? There’s a lot of medical words I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. Yes, this CT scan report from July 15th is likely the one in question. "Incidental finding" means it was something noticed during a scan done for a different reason. Let me see… It appears this scan was done to evaluate some abdominal pain you were experiencing, and this lung finding was unexpected. The report describes a nodule in your left lung, approximately 8 millimeters in size. Do you remember experiencing any abdominal pain around July 15th?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I did. It was… a cramping feeling, mostly. Down low. It wasn’t terrible, but it was uncomfortable. I thought maybe I ate something bad. The doctor just said it was probably indigestion and told me to take some over-the-counter medicine. I didn’t think much of it. They didn’t say anything about… anything in my lungs. Just my stomach. It feels like they didn’t really look at everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the CT scan was primarily for abdominal pain, and this lung finding was discovered incidentally. It sounds like it wasn't the primary focus of the investigation at that time. Now, lung nodules can be caused by many things – old infections, inflammation, or even benign growths. However, it's important to investigate them further to rule out anything concerning. The size of the nodule, 8 millimeters, is relatively small, but we still need to gather more information. To help determine the best course of action, I'd like to review your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been very careful about my health. My mother… she smoked, and it made her very sick. I avoid it completely. And I try to eat healthy, too. I… I don’t understand why this would be happening. Is it… is it serious? I’m getting very worried now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. Avoiding smoking is excellent, and it definitely reduces your risk of lung cancer. It's understandable that you're worried, and it's good to be proactive about your health. The fact that you've never smoked is a positive factor. While finding a nodule is concerning, it doesn't automatically mean it's cancer. Many lung nodules are benign. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a follow-up CT scan to see if the nodule has changed in size. We may also want to consider a low-dose chest X-ray. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: A follow-up scan… yes, that sounds… reasonable. I want to know what’s going on. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news. And… a chest X-ray too? Is that… is that different from the CT scan? I don't like being in those machines, but… I guess I can do it if it will help. Is it safe?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A follow-up CT scan will give us a more detailed look at the nodule and see if there have been any changes since the first scan. A chest X-ray uses a much lower dose of radiation than a CT scan, and it’s a quicker procedure. It's often used as a screening tool to get a general view of your lungs. Both scans use radiation, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis and appropriate treatment far outweigh the small risk associated with the radiation exposure. We take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. Would you like me to explain the procedure for each scan in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I… I just get nervous about those machines. And small spaces. And… what if they find something bad? I don't want to be trapped. What will I have to do? How long will it take? Will it hurt? I know I'm asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Chellsea. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures, and it’s important to understand what to expect. I'm happy to answer all of your concerns. Let's start with the chest X-ray. It's a very quick procedure, usually taking just a few minutes. You’ll stand or sit in front of a detector, and a technician will take a couple of images. It doesn't involve going inside a machine; you'll be fully exposed. You won't feel anything during the procedure; it's completely painless. There’s no preparation required. The CT scan is a bit more involved. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s a relatively narrow space, but we can discuss options for making you more comfortable if you experience claustrophobia. The scan itself takes about 15-20 minutes. You'll need to lie very still during the scan, but you'll be able to communicate with the technician at all times. You might be asked to drink a contrast dye before the scan to help improve the images. Do either of those sound particularly concerning to you?
PATIENT: The CT scan… that sounds very scary. The narrow space… and having to lie still. And what if I panic? I get very anxious, like I said. Maybe I shouldn’t even do it. Is it… is it really necessary? Could they just… monitor me instead? I’m not sure I can handle being in a machine like that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Chellsea. Your anxiety is very valid, and it’s important that we respect your concerns. We absolutely don't want to put you in a situation that’s overly stressful. Let’s talk about alternatives. While a CT scan provides the most detailed images, we could consider a chest X-ray followed by regular monitoring. However, a chest X-ray is less sensitive than a CT scan, and it might not detect small changes in the nodule as early. Another option would be to discuss anti-anxiety medication to help you relax during the CT scan. We can also work with the radiology department to ensure the procedure is as comfortable as possible, including potentially using an open MRI machine, which has a wider opening. Before making any decisions, would you like me to contact the radiology department and discuss these options with them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. Maybe… maybe an open MRI would be better. And talking to someone about the anxiety medication… that might help too. I… I just want to get this over with, but I don’t want to panic while it’s happening. Could you also… could you explain what the nodule is? What does it mean if it grows? What does it mean if it stays the same size? I feel so lost.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. We'll definitely explore those options. I'll reach out to the radiology department right away and see if an open MRI is available and feasible for you. We can also discuss anxiety medication and connect you with a specialist if you'd like. Now, let’s talk about the nodule. A lung nodule is simply a small spot on your lung. They're relatively common, and most are benign – meaning they aren't cancerous. However, it's important to investigate them to rule out any potential problems. If the nodule grows over time, it could indicate that it's becoming more active and might require further evaluation, such as a biopsy to determine the cause. If the nodule stays the same size over time, it's less likely to be a cause for concern, but we would still continue to monitor it periodically to ensure it doesn't change. Think of it like this: a stable nodule is often just a scar from a previous infection or inflammation. A growing nodule warrants further investigation. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a little more sense. A scar… that’s good. I had pneumonia when I was a little girl. Maybe it's just a scar. And monitoring it… that sounds okay. I… I’m still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing what might happen. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. So… you’ll contact the radiology department, and we’ll talk about the anxiety medicine? And then… then we’ll decide what to do next?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. That's exactly right. I'll contact the radiology department this afternoon to discuss the open MRI and their availability. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to talk about your anxiety and explore medication options. In the meantime, I'm going to order a chest X-ray as a baseline and to give us some initial information. It's a quick procedure, and it might help ease some of your anxiety. Do you have any questions for me right now before I step out to arrange those things?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. You’ve been very kind. I… I’ll just wait here, I guess? And someone will come get me for the X-ray? .
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, someone from the radiology department will come to escort you for the X-ray shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let the nurse know if you have any concerns or start to feel anxious while you wait. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have more information from the radiology department. Take a deep breath, and remember I'm here to support you every step of the way. .
