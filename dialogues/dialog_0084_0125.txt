DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, to be frank, my wife thought it was a good idea. I’m here for an HIV test. She gets… worried. It’s probably nothing, honestly. I just want to get it over with and show her it's all fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to reassure your wife. We can definitely do an HIV test. Just to be clear, are you having any symptoms that made you consider getting tested, or is this purely for reassurance?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, absolutely not. I feel perfectly fine. Strong as an ox, if I do say so myself. Honestly, it’s just her. Always reading things online… gets herself worked up over nothing. I told her it's a waste of time, but she insisted. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no fever, no night sweats, no unexplained weight loss, no rash, no swollen lymph nodes… nothing like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Look, I work hard, I eat okay, I sleep… when my wife lets me, that is. I'm a compliance officer, so I sit at a desk most of the day. Not exactly a life of risk, is it? It's probably just a silly precaution. But she'll sleep better, so... here we are.
DOCTOR: Okay. And to get a full picture, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve been married for ten years now, Doctor. And before that… well, I wasn’t exactly running around. My wife is the only one, and she’s… very careful. I’d be surprised if anything could happen, to be honest with you. I find the question a bit insulting, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Belan. I’m just trying to gather all the necessary information, and it’s standard procedure to ask about past STIs as it can affect the accuracy of the test and interpretation of the results. It doesn't mean I think anything happened, it’s just due diligence. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Right, due diligence. I suppose. Well, I take a multivitamin, that’s about it. Nothing for blood pressure, or cholesterol, or anything like that. Healthy as a horse, remember? My wife makes me take the vitamin, thinks I don’t eat enough vegetables. But that’s it. No creams, no pills, just the multivitamin. She gets it delivered every month, so I’m stuck with them.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Absolutely none. I eat everything. Spicy food, shellfish, peanuts… doesn't bother me a bit. She worries about that too, sometimes, when we're on holiday. "Be careful with the street food, Jacquille!" Honestly, she thinks I’m made of glass. But no, no allergies. You can stick me with anything, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. And briefly, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Well, my father lived to a good age, eighty-something. Heart problems, eventually. Mother was… mostly healthy, I suppose. A bit of arthritis as she got older. Nothing major. No history of… you know, serious illnesses. No cancer, no AIDS, no anything like that. A pretty average family, if I'm being honest. Mostly just get old and creaky. Is this really necessary? I mean, I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Just a few more questions, then we can proceed with the test. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would have a fit. She’s very health-conscious, as you’ve probably gathered. And I’m not one for… vices, really. Too much responsibility at work. Compliance officers can’t be seen to be… indulging, you understand. It's just not a good look. So, no smoking. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Perhaps two, on a Friday. If my wife's in a good mood. And maybe a beer when we go out for a nice meal. Nothing excessive. I wouldn't say I drink drink, you understand? It’s more of a… social thing. Maybe three or four drinks a week, tops. Certainly not enough to cause any trouble. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan. That gives me a good picture. Now, just to confirm, you're here today solely for an HIV test at the insistence of your wife, you have no current symptoms, no past STIs, no allergies, and no significant family history. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. You’ve got it exactly right. It's all a bit… excessive, really. But fine. Yes, that’s correct. My wife is just… cautious. So, let's just get this over with, shall we? The sooner I can tell her everything is fine, the better. Now, what does this entail? Do I need to… undress or anything? I hope not.
DOCTOR: No, no need to undress. We’ll just need a small blood sample. It’s a standard finger-prick test, very quick. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get the results. While we wait, I'll document this information in your chart and we can discuss some basic preventative measures, just in case. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A finger prick… alright, that's manageable. Twenty to thirty minutes… I suppose I can spare that. Preventative measures? Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly safe, but fine. Document away. Get it all down in writing so my wife can see how thorough you've been. The more evidence, the better. Just… let's get this over with. Where do I stick my finger?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Please have a seat here. I’ll explain the process and then we'll get you pricked. It’s just a tiny drop of blood, shouldn't be any discomfort to speak of. First, I’ll clean your finger with this alcohol swab, then I’ll quickly prick it with this lancet. Then we’ll collect a small sample of blood on this test strip. It's a rapid test, so we should have results shortly. Okay?
PATIENT: Right. Fine. Just get it over with quickly, please. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can appease my wife. I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. Though I suppose a little prick is better than a full-blown injection. Let's just… be swift. And don’t make a mess, alright? I’ve got a very important compliance report to finish later.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. This will just be a quick pinch. There you go. Just a tiny drop. Now, let's squeeze gently and collect the sample. Alright, let's see what we have here. It takes a few minutes for the results to appear. While we wait, I'll note in your chart that you've undergone HIV testing today. Do you have any questions while we wait?
PATIENT: Right. Not a pleasant sensation, I must say. Though I suppose it's not the end of the world. What exactly is this test looking for, Doctor? I mean, I understand it’s for HIV, but what does a positive result even mean? Not that I expect one, of course. I’m just… curious. For my report, you understand. Need to be informed.
DOCTOR: It's a test for the presence of antibodies your body makes to fight the HIV virus. A negative result means you don't currently have the virus, or if you were recently exposed, your body hasn't had time to produce antibodies yet. A positive result would mean your body has detected the virus, and we would need to confirm with a more detailed blood test and discuss treatment options. It’s important to remember that a positive result doesn't mean an immediate death sentence. There are very effective treatments available now that allow people with HIV to live long and healthy lives. But it's a crucial step in getting proper medical care. Okay, let's see...
PATIENT: Treatment options… right. Well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’m sure it’ll be negative. It has to be. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you repeatedly. But… just out of curiosity, what kind of treatment are we talking about? Pills? Injections? I've got a very busy schedule, you understand. Can't be spending all day at the doctor's office. And what about my wife? Would she need to be tested too? She’s been… a bit stressed lately. So, what does the machine say? Is it negative? Please tell me it's negative.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. The result is… negative. You tested negative for HIV antibodies. Here is a copy for your records. As for your question about treatment, if the result had been positive, treatment typically involves a combination of antiretroviral medications, usually taken as daily pills. It's very manageable, and allows people to live normal, healthy lives. And yes, if the result had been positive, your wife would be offered testing and counseling as well. But thankfully, that's not necessary today. Do you have any other questions, now that we have the results?
PATIENT: Negative. Thank goodness. I knew it. Absolutely knew it. Perfectly healthy, as I’ve told you repeatedly. Honestly, Doctor, it was a waste of time. But my wife will be pleased, so... No, I don't think I have any other questions. Just… I suppose I’ll be going now. Thank you for your time. And perhaps next time, we can skip the unnecessary tests. Really, it was a waste of a perfectly good morning. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I'm glad the result was negative. And while I understand your frustration, routine testing can be important for early detection and prevention. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns in the future. .
