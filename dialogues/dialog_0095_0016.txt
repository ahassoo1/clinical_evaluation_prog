DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… concerning, really. My patient, Mrs. Gable, she’s been on warfarin for a while now, you see, and she’s just… bruising like a peach lately. It’s not normal, not at all. I’ve checked her records, everything should be fine, but… well, you know how it is. Sometimes the numbers don’t tell the whole story.
DOCTOR: I see. Bruising easily, even with a stable warfarin dose, is definitely something we need to investigate. You mentioned checking her records – that's good. Just to confirm, and for my own documentation, how long has she been on warfarin, and when did you first notice the increased bruising?
PATIENT: Honestly? About three years now, I think. Maybe a little less. It’s… difficult to keep track of everything, you understand. A lot of patients. As for the bruising… hmm. It really started picking up maybe a month ago? She mentioned a few little bumps here and there before that, but nothing alarming. This is… different. She was showing me her arms yesterday, and it’s… quite extensive. It’s not the kind of bruising you’d expect, either. It’s… well, I don’t want to bother you with details, but it's not typical.
DOCTOR: No, please, tell me what you mean by “not typical.” Any detail, however small it may seem, could be helpful. Is it related to any specific injuries, or is it appearing spontaneously?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s appearing with very little provocation. She bumped her elbow lightly against a doorframe – lightly, Doctor – and it turned purple immediately. And it’s not just her arms. There’s some on her legs now, too. And… well, she mentioned a tiny one on her back. She didn’t even remember hitting it on anything. It’s… concerning because she’s usually very careful. And she does take her medication as prescribed, I’ve double-checked. It's not like she's skipping doses or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising with minimal trauma, appearing in multiple locations, and occurring despite consistent warfarin adherence. That is concerning. Let's get some more information. Has she noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. She said she’s been feeling a little more tired than usual, but she’s getting on in years, you know? So, that could be anything. And she mentioned… oh, yes! She said her gums bleed a little when she brushes her teeth, more than they used to. Nothing major, but she did point it out. She also said she’s been feeling a bit… achy, all over, but she dismissed it as just getting older. Honestly, she's not one to complain much.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, gingival bleeding, and generalized aches alongside the easy bruising. Those symptoms do raise some flags. I want to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check her vital signs, look at the bruising more closely, and I'll palpate her abdomen to check for any signs of internal bleeding. Then, I’ll want to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a coagulation panel including PT/INR, and possibly a peripheral smear. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Frankly, I’ve been a bit worried. I’m not a specialist in hematology, you understand. I’m a pathologist, I look at tissues, not… blood. So, your expertise is welcome. Yes, please, do whatever you think is necessary. Let’s get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the basics. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I always feel a bit… exposed, doing this. Old habits, I suppose. Always the one looking at the results, not being the result.
DOCTOR: 188 centimeters and 66 kilograms. Thank you. And could you please have a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Do you need me to… roll up my sleeves? I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, you know. A bit… off. But I’m sure it’s nothing. Just getting old.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you don’t mind, please roll up your sleeves so I can examine your arms. And don’t dismiss your symptoms as "just getting old," Mr. Farson. It’s good you're noticing these changes, and we’ll investigate them thoroughly. Now, let's start with your vital signs. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright. It's… a bit drafty in here, isn't it? I don't usually feel the cold this much. And my heart… it’s been fluttering a bit lately, but I’m sure it’s nothing to worry about. Old age, as I said.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, 92 beats per minute, and the rhythm is slightly irregular. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a faint murmur. Let me examine the bruising more closely. Could you point out the areas where you've noticed the most significant changes?
PATIENT: This one here… this appeared after I bumped against the doorframe, like I said. It’s quite painful, actually. And this one… I have no idea how this happened. And this one on the back of my hand… it just appeared overnight, I think. It’s… unsettling. It's not like I’m falling or anything.
DOCTOR: These bruises are indeed quite extensive, and they appear to be at different stages of healing. The tenderness you're describing is also concerning. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen to check for any signs of internal bleeding. This may be slightly uncomfortable, so please let me know if you feel any pain. I'm starting in the upper quadrants and working my way down.
PATIENT: It's… a bit tender here, on the left side. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. I've had some… digestive issues lately, you know. Nothing serious, just… indigestion. But it’s been more frequent recently. And… yes, here too, a little bit. Please be gentle, Doctor. I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your abdomen is mildly tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant and left lower quadrant. Given your symptoms – easy bruising, gingival bleeding, fatigue, the irregular heart rhythm, and abdominal tenderness – I'm concerned about several possibilities, including a potential bleeding disorder or even a hematologic malignancy. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a coagulation panel including PT/INR, a peripheral smear, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a basic inflammatory panel. Would you be comfortable getting blood drawn today?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Get whatever tests you need to get. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m not afraid of a little blood draw. It's better to know, you know? Better to face whatever it is head-on. So, yes, please, proceed with the tests. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will send the orders to the lab now. They’ll need about 10-15 minutes to prepare. While we’re waiting, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, I don't believe so. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I haven't taken anything significant in years, to be honest. Just the occasional pain reliever, and those never bothered me. No, no allergies. I'm fairly certain of that. Although, my wife… she always said I had an allergy to being wrong, but that's neither here nor there.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Actually, now that you mention it… I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one. And I’ve been taking fish oil capsules for my… well, for my heart, actually. A friend recommended them. Said they were good for the… the inflammation. I’ve been taking them for… oh, maybe six months now. Nothing else, I assure you. Just the multivitamin and the fish oil.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin and fish oil capsules. Those can sometimes interfere with blood clotting, so it’s good to know. The lab should be ready for you now. I’ll have a nurse escort you there. Once the blood work is completed, we’ll review the results together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And your patience. It’s… unsettling, being on this side of things, you know? Always the one asking the questions, not answering them. So, thank you. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I’d like to know what’s going on as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: Of course. The nurse will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind. Take care, Mr. Farson. .
