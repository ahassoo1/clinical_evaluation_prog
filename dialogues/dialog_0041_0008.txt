DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like something’s… full. It’s been a bit annoying, really. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blocked ear. I understand. And you said recently… can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Hmm. Not really, no. A few days, maybe? A week? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. I just noticed it when I was… well, I don’t recall what I was doing, actually. Just… noticed it. Is that… helpful? Sorry. I’m not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, don’t worry about it at all. It’s common to not remember specific details. A few days to a week is good enough to start with. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one. The right one seems fine. I… I did try to clean it a bit myself, but it didn’t help. Probably shouldn't have done that, should I? I just… wanted to try something.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the left ear. And you tried cleaning it… I see. It’s generally not recommended to try and clean your ear canal yourself, as you can sometimes push wax further in, or even damage your eardrum. But let’s not worry about that right now. Does it hurt at all?
PATIENT: No, not really hurt. More… pressure, I suppose. Like… when you go up in an airplane. That sort of feeling. It's not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And a little bit muffling, you know? Hard to hear properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and muffling in your left ear, no sharp pain. Have you noticed any ringing in your ear, or any dizziness along with it?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe? It’s very faint. I thought it was just… the house being quiet. Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady sometimes, but that's just… old age, I think. Sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, faint ringing and you attribute some unsteadiness to age. That’s good information. Have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or allergies acting up?
PATIENT: Allergies… yes, I think so. The pollen has been awful this year. Sneezing a bit, runny nose… the usual. I take something for it, a pill… I can’t remember the name, though. Everything is a bit of a blur, honestly. I did have a bit of a sniffle a few weeks ago, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, allergies and a recent mild cold. Let’s do a quick look in your ears. Just want to rule out anything obvious. If you could sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just tell me if it's going to be… unpleasant? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to take a quick peek. It might feel a little cool. Alright, I see some wax buildup in your ear canal, and a little redness. The eardrum itself looks intact, but it's difficult to see clearly with the wax present. No obvious signs of infection at this point. I'm also going to quickly check your right ear, just for comparison. Right ear looks normal.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. Normal is good. So… wax, you say? Is that… serious? I mean, can it be… fixed? I really just want to hear properly again. This is a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's not usually serious, no. Wax buildup is very common. It can definitely be fixed! We can try a few things. The simplest way is often to soften the wax with ear drops and then gently remove it. We could also do a gentle ear irrigation. Do you have any history of a perforated eardrum or any ear surgeries?
PATIENT: Perforated… hmm. Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. My wife… she would have remembered. She kept all the medical records. But she’s… gone now. So, I’m not entirely sure. I don’t think I’ve ever had a problem with my ears before, but I can’t be certain. It's been a while since anyone asked me about my medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of perforated eardrum or ear surgery. We'll proceed cautiously then. Given the redness I saw, I'm going to recommend we don’t do an irrigation right away. We'll start with ear drops – ceruminolytics – to soften the wax. I'm going to prescribe you a course of drops to use twice a day for a week. After a week, if it hasn't improved, come back and we can reassess. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Drops, twice a day. A week. I can manage that. Are they… difficult to use? I’m not very good with… things like that. And will they… sting? I really don’t like stinging. I just want this… blockage gone.
DOCTOR: No, they're not difficult at all. You just lie on your side, put a few drops in your ear, and stay there for a few minutes. They shouldn't sting, but if you feel any discomfort, let me know. Here's the prescription. The pharmacist will explain how to use them, but don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I’m also going to give you some written instructions. If, during the week, you experience any pain, fever, or drainage from your ear, please come back immediately or go to urgent care. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient. I appreciate your help. I really just want to be able to hear my grandchildren again. I think I’ll… go get the drops now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. I understand. I hope they help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy spending time with your grandchildren. .
PATIENT: Yes, thank you again. You too. .
