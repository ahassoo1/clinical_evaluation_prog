DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, frankly. A gentleman doesn’t usually have to speak of these things. But my wife insisted. She says it’s… concerning. I suppose she’s right, women always are, aren't they? Though I don’t recall exactly what is concerning. Just… a bit of a discharge. That’s all.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Right. Well, “a bit of a discharge” is rather vague, Mr. Krok. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Let me think. It’s… not blood, certainly. More… a clear… fluid. Or perhaps slightly… cloudy? It comes and goes, you understand. I haven’t paid terribly close attention. One doesn’t stare at these things, Doctor. It just… appears. And then it’s gone. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness. A few weeks, perhaps? Longer? Time does seem to slip away these days. Is this something serious? My wife worries about everything.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, possibly longer… cloudy fluid… I see. Mr. Krok, with all due respect, vagueness isn't particularly helpful for a proper assessment. Do you experience any discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Well… no, not pain, exactly. It’s not like a toothache. A little… stinging, perhaps? After… well, you know. But it's fleeting. Barely noticeable, really. I am an old man, Doctor. Things ache all over. It’s difficult to isolate anything specific. And truthfully, I haven’t been feeling… quite myself lately. A general malaise, if you will. But that could be the weather. Or my arthritis. Or simply the weight of years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me quickly review your electronic health record... Medicare patient, age 83, Iranian descent... height 157 centimeters, weight 121 pounds. Mr. Krok, have you noticed any fever, chills, or changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't believe so. My wife would have noticed. She’s quite meticulous about taking my temperature. Chills… perhaps a slight shiver on occasion, but that’s the air conditioning, I suspect. It’s always set too cold. And urination… well, it’s… urination. One does it more frequently as one ages, doesn't one? I haven't observed anything different, if that makes sense. Though I do get up a few times a night. But that’s just… old age again. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have my garden to tend to. The tomatoes need pruning.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Now, I'm noting increased frequency of urination… and you mentioned a discharge. Mr. Krok, this could be a number of things. We need to rule out infection, of course. I'm going to need to perform a quick physical examination. Just a standard check, nothing to be alarmed about. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination? Well… I suppose. But do try to be… discreet, Doctor. A gentleman prefers not to have his… private parts unduly scrutinized. I mean, I trust you are a professional, of course. But still… it’s rather a delicate matter. And quickly, if you please. I haven’t got all day. The sun waits for no one, you know. Will it be painful? My wife always says doctors these days don't understand a man's sensibilities.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please. It will be a brief examination, and I assure you, it will not be painful. I will be as efficient as possible. Now, if you could just lie down on the table… and I will need you to lower your trousers. We must be thorough, despite your… sensibilities.
PATIENT: Thorough, is it? Always with the thoroughness… A man can't even have a simple ailment without being subjected to an ordeal. Must one remove everything, Doctor? Surely a simple inspection will suffice. I'm not accustomed to such… exposure. This is most undignified. And do try not to make a fuss. A man's modesty is a precious thing. Honestly, the indignity of it all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please. For the sake of a proper diagnosis, yes, I need a complete examination. Now, I'm palpating your prostate… …and I note some slight enlargement. There’s tenderness upon palpation, as well. I also note some mild redness around the urethral opening. Now, we'll need a urine sample to rule out infection. I'll have the nurse bring you a sterile container.
PATIENT: Enlargement? Tenderness? Redness? Are you telling me something is seriously wrong, Doctor? Because if this is some sort of… dreadful disease… my wife will never let me hear the end of it. I told her I didn’t need to come! I just wanted a quick look, a bit of reassurance! Now you’re telling me about enlargements and tenderness! Honestly, the whole thing is most unsettling. And a urine sample? Must it be a large one? I just emptied my bladder before coming here! This is becoming quite the ordeal.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please try to remain calm. An enlarged prostate is common in men your age – it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. However, the tenderness and redness do warrant further investigation. The urine sample is to rule out infection. It doesn’t need to be large, just enough for a basic analysis. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test. The PSA test is a blood test that can help us determine if further investigation is necessary. I also recommend scheduling an appointment with a urologist. They are specialists in this area and can provide a more thorough assessment.
PATIENT: A urologist? Further assessment? Blood tests? This is preposterous! It started with a little discharge, and now you’re talking about specialists and blood tests and… and enlargements! My wife was right. I should have just ignored it. Now look at the fuss! And what about my garden? The tomatoes will be ruined! Honestly, the indignity of it all! Tell me frankly, Doctor, is this… is this something serious? Don't beat around the bush. A man deserves to know the truth, however unpleasant. And how long will all this take? I haven’t got all day to spend in doctors' offices! Honestly, I'm beginning to feel quite faint. Is there anything I can do about the garden? Perhaps a neighbor could…? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your concern. It is too early to say definitively whether this is “serious.” The PSA test and the urinalysis will provide more information. The urologist can then determine if further investigation, such as a biopsy, is necessary. As for your garden, I suggest asking a neighbor for assistance while you await the results. I will have the nurse schedule these tests for you immediately. Here is a requisition form for the tests, and the number for the urology department. Now, if there is nothing else, I need to attend to other patients. I'll review the results as soon as they are available. Please schedule the urology appointment as soon as possible. .
