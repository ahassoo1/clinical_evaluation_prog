DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back... it's been really bad. Hurts all the time, but especially when I try to stand up straight. It's been getting worse for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that’s been worsening over a few weeks. That’s certainly something we need to look into. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, it's not like a sharp pain, more like... a heavy ache. Feels like someone is sitting on my lower back. And it goes down my legs sometimes, a little bit. Not always, but when I walk a lot it's worse. It makes it hard to do things, you know? Like cleaning, or even just standing to cook.
DOCTOR: I see. A heavy ache in the lower back that sometimes radiates down your legs, and is aggravated by walking and standing. That definitely paints a picture. When you say it goes down your legs, can you describe exactly where you feel it?
PATIENT: It goes down the back of my legs, mostly. Not in the front. And it’s not my whole leg, just from my hips down to my knees, mostly. Sometimes a little bit in my feet, but not always. It feels… like a tingling, kind of. Not numb, but not normal either.
DOCTOR: Okay, radiating pain and tingling down the back of your legs from your hips to your knees – sometimes into your feet. That’s helpful information. Now, has anything specific caused this pain to start, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: That's a hard one. Nothing I can really put my finger on. I didn’t fall or lift anything heavy. It just... started. Maybe a little bit after I started doing more gardening this spring, but it wasn't right after, you know? It was a few weeks later. But I garden every year and never had this before. And… I remember the doctor told me a while back about something… about the cancer… could this be from that?
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific injury, and it seems to have come on gradually, potentially after some increased gardening. And you're understandably concerned about a possible connection to a previous cancer diagnosis. That's very reasonable to bring up. Just to clarify, can you tell me a little bit about that previous cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: It was… a few years ago. They found it in my… my lung. I had some treatments, and they said it was… it was getting better. I go for check-ups every six months. The last one was in January, and everything looked okay then. They did a scan. But... it's always in the back of my mind, you know? And now this back pain… I just worry it's come back, or spread.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Ms. Meigs. It’s very natural to worry, especially with a history of cancer. It's good that you're diligent about your check-ups. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on with your back pain. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling tired a lot lately, but I just thought it was from working. And I haven’t been sleeping very well, because of the pain, of course. I haven't had a fever or anything. No problems with… going to the bathroom. No weight loss. Just the pain and the tiredness, really. Oh! And sometimes my legs feel a little weak, like they might give out, but that doesn’t happen often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, difficulty sleeping, occasional leg weakness along with the back pain and radiating pain. No fever, no bowel or bladder issues, and no weight loss. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on your back on the examination table. That will allow me to assess your back and check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. That sounds good. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. I'm going to gently palpate – that means feel – along your spine and the muscles on either side. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. I'll also check your range of motion. Then, I'll test your reflexes and strength in your legs. Okay, does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there… And a little bit here too… It's not like a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable when you push on it. And when you bend me around… that hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting tenderness in your lower back, slightly to the left and right of your spine. And you’re experiencing discomfort with bending. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. This is just to see how your nerves are functioning. And I'll ask you to push against my hand with your legs, and lift them up off the table. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished on both sides, but not dramatically so. And your strength is 5 out of 5 in all muscle groups, which is good. That means you have full strength. But I am noticing some slight weakness when you try to lift your left leg straight up against resistance. Okay, Ms. Meigs, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities. The tenderness in your lower back, the radiating pain down your legs, and the diminished reflexes suggest a possible nerve impingement – something pressing on a nerve in your lower back. This could be caused by a muscle strain, a bulging disc, or something else. Given your history of cancer, we need to be thorough. I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back – to get a better look at what’s going on. Also, I'll order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. I mean, scary, but good. I want to know what's going on. An MRI and blood work… yes, please. I just want to make sure it’s not the cancer… or anything too bad. Will the MRI tell us for sure?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Meigs. It's completely normal to feel that way. An MRI will give us a much clearer picture of your spine, including the discs, nerves, and any potential masses or inflammation. It won’t definitively rule out everything, but it will give us a lot more information to work with. We’ll also look at the blood work results to check for inflammation and other potential causes of your pain. I'm going to write up the orders for the MRI and blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and she can give you instructions on where and when to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some pain medication to help manage your symptoms. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything to help. The pain is… really wearing me down. A muscle relaxant and pain medication would be wonderful. And… how long will it take to get the MRI results? A few days? A week? I'm just… trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll write up the prescriptions for you. The nurse will explain the dosage instructions. Typically, the MRI results take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We’ll review the results together and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms like numbness or weakness in your legs, or any problems with bowel or bladder control, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful, and I appreciate you listening to me. I just… I’m glad we’re getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help, and I understand your concerns. We're here to support you, and we'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
