DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, Doctor… Jules, you say? Honestly, it’s this… place. The students. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge anymore. It's… exhausting. I've been a teacher for… well, a very long time. And it’s not what it used to be. It truly isn’t.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… dedication to education, Mr. Schlatterer, I’m afraid this isn’t quite the appropriate venue for a discussion of pedagogical methods. I am a physician. Is there a medical complaint I can address?
PATIENT: Medical? Oh. Right. Well… it’s just… everything feels rather… heavy. A constant weight. I sleep poorly, and I find myself… irritable. Very irritable. Though, to be fair, there’s much to be irritable about these days. It's this…stress, you understand? A professional stress, naturally.
DOCTOR: “Heavy,” you say. And poor sleep, irritability… Yes, I see. And this has been… how long, precisely?
PATIENT: How long… Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s… gradual, you see? It didn't simply begin on a certain date. Months, I suppose. Perhaps… six months? Or more? It’s difficult to say, honestly. Everything blurs after a while. I just know it’s… draining. Terribly draining.
DOCTOR: Draining. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and irritability?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What do you mean? Aside from the general decline of civilization, you mean? Well… my appetite isn’t what it once was. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… it simply doesn’t hold the same appeal. And… occasionally, a little… difficulty concentrating. Not that it matters much, given the… state of things. It’s probably just old age, frankly.
DOCTOR: Old age, perhaps. However, it’s my professional duty to investigate. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, Doctor. I’m not ailing. I’m… exasperated. A little tired, perhaps. But pain? No. Though, the sheer ignorance of some of these students is a form of torment, if you want to consider that… but I doubt that’s what you mean. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I used to take something for… my blood pressure, years ago. But I stopped. Doctor Petrov said it wasn't necessary anymore. And… occasionally an aspirin for a headache. Though those are rare these days, thankfully. Is this really important? I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate for a man of my age. It's the world that's the problem, not me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor. I don’t go around seeking things to be allergic to. I suppose… dust bothers me a bit. But who doesn't find dust unpleasant? And I had a rather nasty reaction to some shellfish once, decades ago. Though I haven’t eaten shellfish since, so it’s hardly relevant. Is there an end to these questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! Do I look like the sort of person who indulges in… those activities? I am a retired educator! I dedicated my life to instilling discipline and respect in young minds! Such questions are… insulting, frankly. I assure you, my lifestyle is… perfectly respectable. And I’d appreciate it if we could move on. I have a great deal to do, you know. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on what you’ve told me, and given your… resistance to a thorough examination, my preliminary assessment is… stress and possible mild depression. It's not a definitive diagnosis, of course. I would recommend seeing a therapist. .
