DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth Micucci, 60 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s… well, it’s not a problem, exactly. More like… a little boost, you know? My daughter, she thinks I should get one of those… cards. A “Get Well” card. Even though I am well. Perfectly fine, really. But she worries. She says if a doctor writes it, it’ll make me feel better. Silly girl. But here I am, wasting your time for a card.
DOCTOR: A card… Right. Well, it’s not exactly how I usually spend my time, but… let's see if we can figure out why your daughter thinks you need a “boost”. Sometimes, even if you feel fine, there’s something going on underneath the surface. Now, tell me, have you noticed anything different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Oh, goodness. What do you mean? Everything is… the same. Old age is different, that’s what’s different! My knees creak, I get tired easier… normal things. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very practical woman. I assemble things, I don’t feel things. It’s all very straightforward. Is this going to take long? I have a lovely batch of figurines waiting for me. The porcelain ones, very delicate work.
DOCTOR: Okay, porcelain figurines. Right. Well, even practical women experience changes. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, tiredness… well, it’s been… a while, I suppose. Probably since… the winter, maybe? It's hard to say. Everything blends together after a time, you know? I just… take more naps. And drink a bit more tea. Not a problem, really. My mother always said a good cup of tea fixes everything. But, honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter just feels guilty she doesn't visit enough, so she's making up problems for me. Is this… is this a proper medical reason to bother a doctor? Because I don't want to waste your time if it's just… daughter-related fussing.
DOCTOR: Let's not dismiss it as just daughter-related fussing, alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just her. She worries too much. Always has. Even when she was little. A perfectly healthy girl, but always convinced something was wrong. Honestly, you'd think after sixty years, she'd learn to relax a little. Now, what exactly are you trying to figure out about my tiredness? Because it's not like it’s stopping me from finishing my work, is it? I’m very efficient, you know. A good assembler needs to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, “efficient assembler.” Let’s try this another way. Besides the tiredness and the naps, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well… now that you mention it, I haven't been as hungry lately. Not a huge change, mind you. I still eat. Just… maybe a smaller portion here and there. I mostly eat what my husband makes, he’s a good cook. Traditional Nepalese dishes, very flavorful. But I suppose I could be eating a bit more. Though, truthfully, a little less weight wouldn't hurt. It’s harder to get around these days, you know? But, honestly, Doctor, it's hardly a serious problem. Are you looking for something specific? Because I’m starting to feel a bit silly listing off normal things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about weight loss? I just told you I haven’t been as hungry! It’s not like I’ve been wasting away, Doctor. Honestly, I probably weigh about the same as always. Maybe a little less, but that’s just because I’m… being sensible. I don’t need to eat a huge amount. My husband worries about me, he keeps trying to feed me more lentils. But lentils are… filling. And a bit bland, if you ask me. Honestly, is this really necessary? I just wanted a card! A simple “Get Well” card. This feels like a whole… examination.
DOCTOR: Alright, Janeth. According to my records, you haven’t had a check-up in… five years. And you're currently uninsured. We need to establish a baseline. So, let's just run through a few more questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits?! Oh, honestly! Now you’re just being… invasive. Doctor Billman, I came here for a card, not a… a personal inventory. This is ridiculous. I assemble things, I don't discuss… those things with doctors. And frankly, my bowel habits are perfectly… regular. Always have been. A sensible diet, that’s all it is. And good, strong tea. I can’t believe I’m being asked these questions. I think I’d like to see my daughter and have her explain why she dragged me here. This is a complete waste of my time. And yours, I imagine. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're frustrated. But I'm trying to rule things out. It's my job to ask these questions, even if they seem… personal. I'm going to need you to be a little more cooperative. Now, let’s try this one last time. Are you experiencing any unintentional weight loss at all?
PATIENT: . Honestly, Doctor Billman, this is preposterous. You are trying to diagnose me with… something based on my daughter’s fussing and a perfectly normal appetite! I haven’t wasted away! I eat! I function! I assemble delicate porcelain figurines with steady hands! I will not sit here and be interrogated about my… personal matters. I came for a card. A simple “Get Well” card to appease my overly worried daughter. And frankly, after this ordeal, I think I need a cup of tea – and a very strong one at that. I’m leaving. And I suggest you find a patient who enjoys discussing their… bowel habits. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: .
