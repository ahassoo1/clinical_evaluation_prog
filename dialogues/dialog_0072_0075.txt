DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 83 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 83, though I sometimes feel younger! Well, it's this daytime sleepiness, really. I've been getting treated for sleep apnea for a while now – with the machine, you know, the CPAP – and it should be helping, but I’m still awfully tired during the day. It's just… draining, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. You've been on CPAP therapy for sleep apnea. And despite consistent use, you’re still experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness. That is concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… hmm. Well, I wake up, usually around 7, though sometimes a little earlier. I used to be a very early riser, always. I have a small breakfast – toast, usually, and some coffee. I try to read the newspaper, but honestly, I often find myself nodding off right in my chair. Then, I’ll do a little bit of puttering around the house – you know, little chores, maybe some gardening if the weather’s nice. I volunteer at the local library a couple of afternoons a week, which I enjoy, but even there, I sometimes struggle to stay awake during meetings. Lunch is… fairly simple. And then, usually just relaxing, watching a bit of television, until bedtime. It’s not a very exciting life, but it’s my life. And the tiredness is making even that feel… heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, consistently tired despite CPAP use, even with relatively low exertion activities. You mentioned nodding off in your chair and even during meetings at the library. How long would you say these… episodes of sleepiness last?
PATIENT: Oh, not long, thankfully. Not like collapsing asleep, you understand. More like… dozing off. A few minutes, maybe five, ten at the most. Long enough to startle myself awake, and feel quite disoriented for a bit. It's the frequency that’s bothersome, Doctor. It happens several times a day. I’m not doing anything strenuous when it happens – just sitting, reading, or listening. And it worries me, frankly. I don’t want to fall and hurt myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Paske, and it’s good that you’re being proactive about this. While the CPAP should be addressing the apnea, sometimes there are other factors at play. Let’s go through a brief review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you've been treated for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Are those conditions currently well-controlled?
PATIENT: Yes, they are, thank you for asking. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez – keeps a close eye on them. I take my medications religiously, and I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet. My blood pressure is usually around 130/80, give or take, and my cholesterol… well, it’s under control, at least that's what Dr. Ramirez tells me. He's a good doctor. I see him every three months, like clockwork. I don’t believe this tiredness is related to those conditions, though. It feels… different. More like a deep, pervasive fatigue. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Paske. It’s helpful to know those chronic conditions are stable. And you’re right to differentiate this fatigue. It's important. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides those for your hypertension and hyperlipidemia, are you taking anything else – over-the-counter medications, supplements, herbal remedies, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I take a baby aspirin every day, Doctor – Dr. Ramirez suggested that years ago, just as a precaution. And… oh, yes! I take a vitamin D supplement. My levels were a little low on my last blood test. And sometimes, if I’m having trouble sleeping – ironically – I'll take a melatonin tablet. Just a small one, 3mg. But not very often, you understand. Perhaps once or twice a week. Other than that… no, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. Baby aspirin, Vitamin D, occasional melatonin. That’s good information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I’ve been a little more irritable lately, perhaps. My daughter tells me so, anyway. She says I'm not myself. And… my memory hasn't been as sharp as it used to be, though I suppose that's to be expected at my age. But it feels… a bit more than just age-related forgetfulness, if that makes any sense. Nothing drastic, just… little things. Forgetting names, misplacing my glasses , things like that. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Not enough to fall, thankfully, but just a little… off balance. It’s probably nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Irritability, some memory difficulties, and occasional unsteadiness. These are important details. Given your age, the history of sleep apnea, and these additional symptoms, I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination to assess your balance, reflexes, and coordination. Also, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work to check for any underlying deficiencies or other medical issues that could be contributing to your fatigue and other symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if some tests can help, then please, let’s do them. Balance, reflexes… whatever you think is necessary. I appreciate you taking this seriously. I'm just… tired of being tired, you know? So yes, please. Let’s get it sorted. When can we do these tests?
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll order a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, Vitamin B12 levels, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. We’ll also check your iron studies. We can perform the neurological exam here, now. It will take about fifteen to twenty minutes. If you'll just follow me… please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Alright. Shoes and socks, you say? Very well. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. It’s a bit of a shame to take off my socks, they’re quite comfortable. But a bit of discomfort is a small price to pay, I suppose, if it helps find the answer.
DOCTOR: Please sit on the examination table, Mr. Paske. I'm going to assess your balance first. Please keep your arms at your sides and look straight ahead. We will start with the Romberg test. Stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Try to maintain your balance for 30 seconds. Let me know if you feel unsteady or need to stop.
PATIENT: Alright. Feet together, eyes closed… Here we go… thirty seconds, you say? It's a little difficult… …trying to keep steady… oh dear. I don’t think I can… Oh, that's… not good, is it? I’m a bit unsteady, Doctor. Definitely unsteady.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observed some instability. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to test your deep tendon reflexes in your knees and ankles. Keep your leg relaxed.
PATIENT: Oh! That was… a bit sharp. There… I think it moved, didn’t it? It feels… diminished, somehow. Not as strong as it used to be. Did you get a good response? It doesn't feel quite right.
DOCTOR: The responses are indeed diminished bilaterally, Mr. Paske. We will proceed with a brief gait assessment to observe your walking pattern. If you could just walk a few steps back and forth, please. Try to walk naturally.
PATIENT: Very well. A few steps back and forth… One… two… three… Oh, goodness. It’s not as easy as it looks, is it? My balance doesn’t feel quite right. I’m afraid I’m rather clumsy today, Doctor. I don’t usually walk like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. That was sufficient. Based on the neurological examination, I observe diminished reflexes, some instability during the Romberg test, and an unsteady gait. I have reviewed the initial blood work results. Your Vitamin B12 levels are low, which could be contributing to some of your symptoms. Additionally, your iron levels are also slightly below the optimal range. Given these findings, and considering your history of sleep apnea and the presence of fatigue, irritability, and memory difficulties, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of vitamin deficiencies and potentially, a neurological component related to your sleep apnea. We need to investigate further. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Structural abnormalities? What does that mean? Is it… bad? I thought it was just a bit of tiredness… and some memory lapses. I didn't realize it could be… something like that. What are we looking for, exactly? And… what if it is something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Paske, an MRI is a diagnostic imaging test that provides detailed pictures of the brain. It’s a standard procedure when investigating neurological symptoms. I'm not suggesting anything definitive at this point. However, given the combination of your symptoms – the fatigue, memory problems, irritability, unsteadiness, and the low vitamin levels – it is prudent to rule out any underlying structural issues that could be contributing to your condition. We are looking for any abnormalities in the brain structure, such as lesions, atrophy, or inflammation, which could be affecting your cognitive function and coordination. It is possible the symptoms are solely related to the vitamin deficiencies, but we need to investigate all possibilities. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we will proceed cautiously. The MRI is a non-invasive procedure. I will refer you to a neurologist for a consultation and to interpret the results. In the meantime, I will prescribe Vitamin B12 injections and an iron supplement to address the deficiencies. We will also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the neurologist's recommendations and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Injections… a neurologist… it’s a lot to take in, Doctor. Yes… yes, that sounds… acceptable. I suppose I have no other choice, do I? When… when will I have the MRI? And… will I need someone to drive me? I don't think I’d feel safe driving afterward, with… everything. I just… I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: The imaging center is located at 123 Main Street. I’ve included the referral form with the address and contact information. You’ll need to schedule the appointment directly with them. They will be able to provide you with specific instructions regarding preparation and contrast dye, if necessary. As for driving, yes, I strongly recommend having someone accompany you. The contrast dye, if used, can cause temporary drowsiness. It's best to avoid driving or operating machinery for the remainder of the day. The neurologist I’m referring you to is Dr. Evelyn Reed. She is an excellent physician. I will forward your medical records to her office. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the MRI results and her recommendations. In the meantime, start the Vitamin B12 injections and iron supplement as directed. Do you have any other questions at this time, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed… yes. Two weeks… No… no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you… for everything. I… I suppose I’ll just go and schedule the appointment. Thank you. .
