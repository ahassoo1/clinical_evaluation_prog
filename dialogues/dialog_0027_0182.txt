DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I haven't got all day, you understand. It's about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, she insists I get checked out before I do it. Says the surgeon needs a clearance. It’s a bit silly, really. I've been perfectly healthy my whole life. Terrazzo work keeps a man fit, you know. But, here I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. It’s always good to be thorough, and your daughter sounds very caring. A pre-operative clearance is quite standard, actually. Terrazzo work does sound physically demanding. So, this procedure…can you tell me what it is, and when it’s scheduled?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…cosmetic. A face lift. Don’t you stare. My daughter says I look…tired. She says it’ll take ten years off. Honestly, I think she just wants to show me off to her friends. It’s next month, the 28th. Dr. Albright, good man, very expensive, but supposed to be the best in the city. Now, are we done here? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: A facelift, alright. Dr. Albright has a good reputation, yes. And no, we’re not quite done yet. Just a few questions to make sure everything is alright before we give clearance. It's standard procedure, I assure you. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Never. A bit of arthritis in my hands, naturally, after all these years with the trowel, but that's it. I eat a sensible diet – mostly fish, you know – and I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My wife, God rest her soul, she always said I was too stubborn to let anything bad happen to me. I take a multi-vitamin, that’s all. And a little cod liver oil for the joints. Are we still not finished?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Very good. Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to handle all sorts of chemicals on the job, you know, polishing compounds, sealants… never a problem. Look, Doctor, I really don't see what all these questions are for. I'm a perfectly healthy eighty-one-year-old man. Shouldn't I be getting a pat on the back, not a grilling?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It’s just that surgery, even cosmetic surgery, carries some risk. We need to make sure there aren’t any hidden issues that could complicate things. Now, have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Never. I told you, I’m a healthy man. I’ve broken a few bones over the years – fell off a scaffold once, silly thing – but they all healed just fine. No need for cutting and slicing, always. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Is there a shorter form I can fill out?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ll try to be as brief as possible. Let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, stroke, cancer, or other serious illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Heart disease… my father had it, I suppose. Died young, sixty-two. Stroke, maybe my aunt on my mother’s side. Cancer… well, old man Hemmings down the street, he got it, but he smoked like a chimney. Honestly, Doctor, we all die of something eventually. It’s the way of things. Are you planning on interrogating my entire family tree now?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all. Just trying to get a complete picture. And finally – and this is important – are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides the multi-vitamin and cod liver oil?
PATIENT: Honestly, just those two. I take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And sometimes, if my hands are really bothering me, I rub some liniment on them. You know, the stuff old Mrs. Olsen used to sell down at the market? It smells terrible, but it seems to help. Now, can we please be done? I’ve got a perfectly good smoked salmon waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for your patience. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, I’d like to quickly examine you. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. It will only take a few minutes. Then, I can give you my assessment and determine if you're a suitable candidate for surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to be impressed. I’ve seen more thorough examinations from a veterinarian. Just… be quick about it, please. The salmon won’t stay warm forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. Relax your arm for me, please. Blood pressure first. 130 over 80. Not bad. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Good. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly diminished. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: No, I do not! I walk up and down three flights of stairs every day to get to my workshop! I may be eighty-one, Doctor, but I'm not useless. And diminished? What's that supposed to mean? Are you implying I'm on my last legs? Honestly, this is becoming quite offensive.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all, Mr. Orwin! Diminished simply means the sounds are a little quieter than expected, which can be common with age. It doesn't indicate anything serious. I just want to be thorough. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax, please. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No. It’s just… I had a bit of a bad oyster last week. Upset my stomach something fierce. But it’s fine now. Perfectly fine. Are you quite finished poking around? I’m starting to feel rather… violated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. That’s all for the physical exam. Abdomen is soft, and no masses or tenderness detected. Now, given your age and the slightly diminished heart sounds, I recommend a quick EKG and a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying issues before we give the clearance for surgery. It's a standard precaution. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, you’re trying my patience. Look, I’ve already told you, I’m a healthy man! But… fine. Yes. Get it over with. But I expect results quickly, understand? And I expect a full explanation of everything. I don’t want any surprises. And if it takes too long, I’m cancelling the whole thing. My salmon is waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Orwin. We’ll get the tests scheduled for tomorrow morning, and I'll personally review the results as soon as they’re available. I’ll call you with the findings, and we can discuss them in detail. Is there a number I can reach you at?
PATIENT: 555-1234. And don’t bother calling before noon. I like to have my coffee in peace. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve wasted quite enough time here. I have a lunch date with a perfectly good piece of fish.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand. We’ll call you after noon. Thank you for your patience, and have a pleasant lunch. We’ll be in touch soon. And please, don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Hmph. Good day.
