DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. My blood pressure’s been acting up, that’s why I’m here. The numbers just haven’t been right, and my regular doctor thought I should come see someone… someone like you. I don’t really understand all the fuss about numbers, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Lots of people feel that way about blood pressure numbers! We can definitely figure this out together. So, your doctor mentioned your blood pressure wasn’t quite right. Do you know what those numbers were, or roughly when they were taken?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was about a week ago, maybe a little longer. Old Man Hemlock, he took it at the pharmacy. I think… I think he said the top number was… 150-something? And the bottom one was around 90? Something like that. It's hard to remember exactly. I was more worried about getting my blueberry pie baked for the church social.
DOCTOR: Okay, 150/90… that is a little elevated. We generally like to see blood pressure under 130/80. And no worries about the pie – priorities are priorities! Just to get a clearer picture, have you been feeling any symptoms along with the higher blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick? No, not really. I feel a little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old, dear! Tired comes with the territory. I haven't had headaches or anything like that. Just… regular old aches and pains, you know? My knees bother me more than anything.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Tiredness can be very common at any age, especially at 90! It’s good to rule things out though. And knee pain is… well, very common too! Have you noticed any changes in your vision, like blurry spots, or any dizziness when you stand up?
PATIENT: Blurry spots… sometimes. But I've got cataracts, you know? Doctor said they’re just part of getting old. Dizzy… not really. I get a little lightheaded if I stand up too fast, but that's been happening for years. I just hold onto the furniture. Learned that trick a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know about the cataracts and the occasional lightheadedness. Do you have a history of diabetes, or has anyone in your family had it?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, not me. And as far as I know, nobody in my family had it either. My mama was healthy as a horse 'til the day she died, and my daddy… well, he just wore himself out working the land. We didn’t spend much time at doctors back then. Mostly just home remedies and a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take something for my arthritis, a little white pill. And… oh, yes! A water pill, because my feet swell up sometimes. And a little something for my heart, Doctor Hemlock prescribed it after I had that flutterin’ feeling a few years back. I think that's it. I keep them in a little tin box in the kitchen. It’s hard to keep track, dear. I’ve got so many little pills!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, we can take our time. Do you happen to know the names of any of those medications?
PATIENT: Names… oh, land sakes. I just tell Doctor Hemlock to keep refilling the ones I need. I don’t really pay attention to the names. The arthritis one… I think it starts with an “N”? And the water pill… it’s blue, I remember that. I’m sorry, dear. I’m just not good with remembering things like that. I'm more of a baker than a medicine woman.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Venna. Don't worry about it at all. We can figure this out. Since you don't know the names, do you have the pill bottles with you today?
PATIENT: Oh! Now that you mention it… I think I do. Here they are. A right mess, aren’t they? Doctor Hemlock keeps changing them around. You’ll have to excuse the condition of my purse, dear. It’s seen better days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. This is very helpful. Let’s see… Naproxen 500mg, that's the arthritis medication. Furosemide 20mg, that’s the water pill. And… Digoxin 0.125mg, that's for your heart. Okay, so you’re taking Naproxen, Furosemide, and Digoxin. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take penicillin when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I get a little itchy sometimes, but I think that’s just the dry air. And I get heartburn if I eat too much chocolate, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I do love my chocolate, you see.
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn't an allergy. Okay, so no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama always said they were the devil's sticks, and I listened to her. Bad for your lungs, she said. And they smelled awful. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, myself. Much better for you.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little sip of wine on special occasions. Like Christmas, or when the church ladies get together. Nothing regular, you understand. Just enough to take the edge off. And I always eat something with it. Doctor Hemlock says a little bit is alright. It's good for the heart, he says. A little bit, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wine on occasion. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit. I've had doctors poke and prod at me for ninety years, I reckon I’m used to it. Just be gentle with my old bones, alright? They creak a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing deeply for me, please. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 88 beats per minute. And I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we'll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear, but a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Your pulse is regular but a bit weak. Your blood pressure is 162/94 today, which is elevated. Given your blood pressure readings and the murmur I heard, I would like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a few other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A murmur, you say? Blood work… is it going to hurt? I don't like needles much. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. I just want to get this sorted out. I’ve got a pie to bake for the church social, you know. And I need to be around to enjoy it.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Venna, but it’s good we’re getting a closer look. The blood work will help us figure out what’s going on and make sure we're on the right track. And yes, it will involve a needle, but it’s a quick pinch, and then it’s over. We’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. The lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form, and they’ll take care of everything. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. If you think it's best. A quick pinch, you say? I suppose I can handle a quick pinch. A pie isn't going to bake itself, but I can’t enjoy it if I’m not feeling well. Write me that form, and I’ll head down to the lab. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll try not to cause too much trouble. Old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Venna. The lab is just down the hall to your left. Tell them Dr. Rosanova sent you, and they’ll take good care of you. It shouldn't take long. And don't worry about causing trouble – they're used to patients of all ages. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can go ahead and relax. I'll give you a call as soon as the results are back, usually within a couple of days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… please call me as soon as you get those results. I want to get this sorted out, you know? And thank you for being so patient with an old woman. It’s not easy keeping track of things these days. I guess I’ll head down to the lab now. Wish me luck with the pinch. And thank you again, Dr. Rosanova.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. And don't worry about the pinch – you'll be just fine. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and enjoy your pie! .
