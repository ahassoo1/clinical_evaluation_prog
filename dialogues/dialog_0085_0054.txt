DOCTOR: Good morning, Rayshon. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I’m a family medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning, Doctor Lahn. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… cough. Yeah, I got cough. Long time already. And… tired also. Very tired. I dunno… just feel not good, you know? Sometimes… my nose… blocked. A lot. Then runny. Happens a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough that's been going on for a while, feeling tired, and a stuffy and runny nose. That does sound frustrating. Let's try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, about the cough – how long exactly has it been going on?
PATIENT: Long time… really long. Maybe… six months? Or more? I forget already. It comes and goes, but… it always comes back. I work… fixing tires. Dusty work, you know? Maybe from dust? I dunno. I try drink water… doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more, coming and going. And you work fixing tires, so there’s a lot of dust exposure. That’s good information to have. It certainly could be related to the dust. And when the cough is happening, what does it sound like?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… not dry cough. Got… stuff coming up. Phlegm. Sometimes… yellowish. Sometimes clear. Not… much blood. I think. I forget. It's… a bad cough. Makes me… wake up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, productive cough with phlegm – sometimes yellow, sometimes clear, and no blood that you recall. Wakes you up at night. That’s helpful. Now, about the tiredness – is it constant tiredness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… most of the time tired. Even after sleep. Not… good sleep, maybe? I work long hours, you know? My wife… she say I snore a lot. Maybe that’s why I tired? I dunno. Just… feel weak all the time. Hard to lift tires sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly constant tiredness, even after sleep, and your wife mentions you snore a lot. That’s good information; snoring can definitely disrupt sleep and lead to fatigue. Feeling weak and having trouble lifting tires is concerning as well. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you had any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever… I think… sometimes feel warm. Not… high fever. Just a little warm. Chills… not really. Body ache… sometimes after work. But… I lift heavy things, you know? So maybe from that. Hard to tell. I don't really check temperature or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional feeling warm, but no high fever, no chills, and body aches that might be related to work. That helps narrow things down. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Sometimes… when I walk up the stairs, feel a little bit… breathless. Not… bad, but… noticeable. Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes… a little bit uncomfortable when I cough very hard. But… not pain. Just… ouch. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with stairs, and some discomfort with hard coughing, but not actual pain. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung condition?
PATIENT: Lung condition… uh… no, I don’t think so. Doctor never told me anything like that. I… I got sick sometimes, normal sick. Cough, flu… but never… special sick. I dunno what you mean, special sick. I just fix tires, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnosis of lung conditions. That’s good to know. Let's talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have asthma, allergies, or any other respiratory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother... she used to cough a lot when she was old. Not like me, but... always cough. My father... he was strong, never sick. My wife... she sometimes got allergies. Flowers... makes her nose itchy. That's all I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a cough when she was older, and your wife has flower allergies. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… no, I don’t think so. Never got allergic to anything. I eat everything. My wife… she allergic to some seafood. But me… no. Never got rash or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No... nothing. I don’t take anything. Just drink water. And coffee... for work. My wife... she take some vitamins. But me... no. I try to be healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Thank you, Rayshon, that gives me a good overview of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take your temperature. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah... okay. That's okay. Listen to my lungs… okay. Check… heart. Okay. Temperature… okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Alright, I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs. That suggests some inflammation or narrowing of the airways. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise normal. Temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit – slightly elevated. Your lymph nodes feel normal, and I don't notice any significant abnormalities. Given your symptoms and the findings on the exam, it sounds like you may have bronchitis, potentially complicated by some mild asthma. The dust exposure from your work is definitely a contributing factor. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum sample. Would you be able to come back to the clinic tomorrow to get those done?
PATIENT: Chest... X-ray? And... sputum? What is sputum? Is... bad? I don't want anything bad, Doctor. I just want to fix tires, you know? Is the X-ray... safe? And… how much cost? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Rayshon. Let me explain. A chest X-ray is a quick and painless imaging test that lets us see your lungs more clearly. It's very safe – the amount of radiation is very low. It helps us rule out things like pneumonia or other lung problems. A sputum sample is just a small amount of mucus you cough up from your lungs. We send it to the lab to check for any infection. As for the cost, the X-ray will be around \$150, and the sputum test is about \$50. I know you mentioned not having much money, and I can definitely see what resources are available to help with the cost. We might be able to offer a discount, or connect you with a program that can assist with medical bills. We'll figure something out. Do you feel comfortable proceeding with the tests?
PATIENT: \$150? And \$50? That's… a lot of money. I dunno… my wife… she will be worried. Hmm. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe… medicine? Just to make the cough better? I really don't want to do the tests if it costs so much. Maybe… I can just try to avoid the dust?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Rayshon. It's perfectly reasonable to feel hesitant. While I can prescribe some medication to help manage your cough symptoms – like a bronchodilator to open your airways and an expectorant to help you cough up mucus – it's important to know that these will only treat the symptoms, not the underlying cause. Without knowing what's causing your cough, it’s hard to provide the most effective treatment. Given your work environment, simply avoiding the dust might not be enough, as some exposure is likely unavoidable. Here's what I can do: I'll prescribe a bronchodilator and expectorant to help alleviate your symptoms for now. We'll also discuss ways to minimize your dust exposure at work – perhaps using a mask or improving ventilation. I strongly recommend we try to find a way to get the X-ray done, even if it means scheduling it in installments or looking into financial assistance options. If your symptoms worsen – especially if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – you need to seek medical attention immediately. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Okay... medicine sounds good. A mask... yeah, I can try a mask. And... not so much dust. My wife... she can help me find a good mask. If it gets worse... I will come back. No X-ray... for now. Just medicine. Okay? I really don't want to worry my wife with more bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rayshon, that’s perfectly understandable. We’ll start with the medication and focus on minimizing dust exposure. I’m going to prescribe you Albuterol, which is a bronchodilator that you’ll inhale using an inhaler. It will help open your airways when you feel your cough getting worse or you're short of breath. I’ll also prescribe Guaifenesin, which is an expectorant that will help you cough up mucus. I’ll also give you a written plan on how to use the inhaler and when to take the medication. Please follow these instructions carefully, and remember, if your symptoms worsen – fever, severe shortness of breath, or chest pain – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about the medication or the care plan?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Inhaler… when cough… and guaife… when got mucus. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. My wife will be happy I don't need the… X-ray. And… I will try to not so much dust. Okay… I think that’s all. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or you're not feeling better, please don't hesitate to come back. We're here to support you. Take care, and get some rest. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
