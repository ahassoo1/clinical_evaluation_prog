DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit of a bother, really. I just haven't been feeling right, and it's been going on for a little while now. Mostly, I feel sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't get hungry like I used to. Even a small bite of food… well, it just fills me up too fast. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain sometimes, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. Right. Nausea and early satiety… so you feel full quickly. And how long has this “not feeling right” been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… that’s a good question. It feels like… a couple of months, maybe? Or has it been longer? Time just seems to slip away these days. I remember it started gradually, not all at once. At first, I thought it was just a little upset stomach, you know? Something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away. It's just… persistent. And it’s making it hard to enjoy things, even simple things like a nice cup of tea with a biscuit. I used to love my biscuits…
DOCTOR: Persistent nausea for a couple of months… alright. And is there anything specifically that seems to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat. Sometimes it's worse in the mornings, but other times… it just comes on randomly. It's not tied to a certain food, or a certain time of day. That's what's so strange about it. I've tried eating bland things, like crackers, and that doesn't seem to help much either. It just… happens. Is that normal, Doctor? I’ve always been pretty regular, so this is a new thing for me.
DOCTOR: “Regular” is a very subjective term, Raymonde. Let's not jump to conclusions. Have you experienced any weight loss along with this nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. I suppose I have. My daughter, Sarah, she pointed it out a few weeks ago. She says I'm looking… thinner. I hadn’t really noticed it myself, to be honest. I just haven't had much of an appetite, and when I do eat, it's not much. I used to weigh a bit more, I think. But I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore. It’s just… less energy to worry about it. It’s hard to explain. I try to eat, but it's not enjoyable when you feel sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weight loss and nausea… and for how long approximately has this weight loss been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Probably… a few months as well, I reckon. Around the same time as the nausea, maybe a little longer. It’s been a slow thing, not like I suddenly lost a lot of weight overnight. Just… gradually. Sarah's a worrier, bless her heart, she keeps checking on me. She's been making me soups and things, but I can only manage a few bites. I don’t want her fussing too much, but she’s a good daughter. She reminds me of my mama sometimes. Is that… important, Doctor? Knowing how long it's been happening?
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Raymonde. We’re trying to establish a timeline here. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea and weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit tired lately, more than usual. Just… sluggish. I put it down to my age, mostly. But now that you mention it… I have been feeling a bit weaker, too. It takes a lot of effort to get things done around the house, things I used to do without even thinking. And… sometimes I feel a little bit… breathless. Not all the time, but especially when I try to do something strenuous. Like carrying groceries. Is… is that something to worry about, Doctor? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath… Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. I haven’t been… regular, I suppose you could say. It’s been a bit… unpredictable. Sometimes I feel like I need to go, but… nothing comes out. And other times… well, let's just say it's not as firm as it used to be. I thought it was just something I ate, but now that you ask… it’s been going on for a while too. I really don’t like talking about this, Doctor. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Raymonde. We need to get a full picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, back in… oh, I don’t know, the seventies maybe? And I have arthritis, in my hands mostly. It’s just a little bit achy, nothing too bad. And… oh, yes! I was diagnosed with… with something a few years back. Cancer. Lung cancer. It was small, they said, and they did some… treatments. Radiation, I think. They said it was under control, but I’ve been… a little forgetful since, so I don’t really remember all the details. It’s been a while, you see. Does that… matter, Doctor? I hope that doesn’t change things.
DOCTOR: Lung cancer… and you’ve completed treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As far as I know, I did. It was… a long time ago, maybe five or six years now. I had lots of appointments, and they said everything looked good at the time. I was supposed to go for check-ups, but… honestly, I'm not very good at keeping track of appointments. And I just… I didn't want to worry about it all the time, you see? I just wanted to get on with things. It’s probably nothing, though. Just my age, maybe. Or something I ate. I really don’t like to be a bother. I just wanted to get this nausea sorted out, so I can enjoy my tea again. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor? I'm getting a bit tired now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s standard procedure. Then, given your history of lung cancer, and these new symptoms, I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. That’s just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… serious. But I suppose it’s best to be sure, isn’t it? Blood work and an X-ray. I can do that. Though, I do get a little nervous with doctors. All those machines. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem very… efficient. Is it going to take long? I have a bit of a program on the television I like to watch later. But I’ll do whatever you think is best. Just… please be gentle. And try not to take too much blood, if you can. My veins aren’t very good these days.
DOCTOR: It won't take long, Raymonde. And I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me...
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breath… like this? Raymonde takes a slow, shaky breath. Is that good? I used to be a pretty good breather, back when I was dancing. It was a long time ago now, though. I haven't danced in years. It’s… hard to get motivated sometimes. But I can still remember the steps, if you ask me. She pauses, then coughs softly. There. Is that alright? I hope I’m doing it right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I’ll just gently press here… and here… Does this cause any pain, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little bit tender, yes. Just there, on the right side. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe. It's been like that for a while, I suppose. I just thought it was… gas. Or something I ate. But it doesn’t go away, does it? I really don’t like having things poked and prodded, Doctor. Is something wrong? I can feel my heart racing a little bit now. Maybe I shouldn’t have had that biscuit with my tea this morning. It was a nice biscuit, though.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right upper quadrant… Alright. Given your history, and these findings, I think it’s best to proceed with the blood work and chest X-ray. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It’s standard procedure, Raymonde. It will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we're addressing everything appropriately. And just to clarify, have you noticed any change in your stool color, recently?
PATIENT: Oh. More blood? Raymonde sighs softly. Well, alright. If you think it's necessary. But I really do get faint sometimes, with all this… poking and prodding. As for my… stool color? Goodness, I haven’t really been paying attention, Doctor. I just… go to the bathroom when I need to, you see? I don’t really look at it. Is that bad? I’m probably a terrible patient. I just want to feel better, so I can have my tea again. And maybe… maybe have another biscuit. Is that too much to ask? I haven’t been enjoying much lately, you see. Everything just feels… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try to relax. We’re just being thorough. And frankly, paying attention to your bowel movements is a part of maintaining your overall health. The nurse can provide you with information on what to look for. We'll get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I… I appreciate you taking the time. She looks down at her hands, her expression worried. I hope… I hope it's nothing serious. A long pause. I really do want to have my tea again.
