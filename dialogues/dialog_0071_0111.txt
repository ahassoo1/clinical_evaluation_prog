DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, Doctor. Look, I haven’t got all day. It’s… my skin. It’s getting darker, you see. And I tire so easily these days. It’s quite bothersome, really. Frankly, I suspect it’s nothing serious, but my wife insisted I come. A woman… always worrying.
DOCTOR: Right, skin darkening and fatigue. I understand. It's good your wife encourages you to get things checked out. While it may be nothing, it’s always best to be sure. Now, when did you first notice the skin darkening?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. Some time ago, I should think. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It all blends together, you know. I’ve been… occupied. Important work, reinforcing iron. Not like these young people today, always needing to document everything. It just happened. Is it really necessary to be so precise?
DOCTOR: I appreciate that it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, Mr. Drahota. Weeks to months is helpful, though. And you mentioned "reinforcing iron"…are you involved in metalworking or something similar?
PATIENT: Metalworking? Good heavens, no. I am reinforcing iron. It’s a trade, Doctor. A respectable one. I’ve been doing it for… well, a very long time. It’s strenuous work, naturally. All that bending and lifting. Perhaps it’s simply… the work. Though I’ve always been a strong man. It’s just… more noticeable now, this fatigue. And the… discoloration. It's not a pleasant look, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a long history of strenuous physical work. And the skin discoloration…where exactly are you noticing it, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. It’s not… localized. My arms, my face… perhaps a bit more on my hands. It's difficult to say. I don’t spend much time examining myself, Doctor. I have more pressing matters, you understand. Important projects. Though my wife keeps pointing it out, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things… and a talent for unnecessary worry.
DOCTOR: Everywhere… I see. And has anything changed recently with your work?
PATIENT: Changed? No! What would change? Iron is iron, Doctor. One bends it, one secures it. The process remains the same. Perhaps a slightly different supplier lately, but the metal itself is… metal. Honestly, are you implying something about the quality of the materials? I’ve been using the same methods for decades! This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all! I’m just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Drahota. Different suppliers can sometimes have subtle variations. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I'm tired, as I’ve already stated. And… occasionally a bit achy. But that's to be expected, wouldn't you agree? A man my age doing physical labor? It’s hardly a medical marvel. No, I don’t believe I have any… other symptoms. I eat reasonably well, sleep when I can, and avoid unnecessary excitement. A simple life, Doctor. A simple, tiring life. Is this all? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional aches. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly… intact. But, fine. Do what you must. But please be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And do be gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. Just a quick look. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart sounds are normal. I'm going to examine your skin more closely now. I notice some hyperpigmentation – that’s the darkening you mentioned – and it appears more prominent on your hands and exposed areas. The skin feels…slightly thickened in some areas. No rashes or lesions. Now, let’s check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly tender. No obvious masses.
PATIENT: Enlarged? What do you mean, enlarged? Is something wrong? This is precisely why I didn't want to be poked and prodded. Look, Doctor, I'm a practical man. Tell me straight. Is it serious? And if so, what are we going to do about it? I haven't got time for… vague observations. I have a project to finish, you know. A very important project.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, please don’t worry. “Enlarged” can mean many things, and it’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm. It simply means your lymph nodes are a bit bigger than usual. Given your history of strenuous physical work and the skin changes, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I want to check your iron levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. We’ll also check a liver panel. It’s possible this is related to your work, but we need the tests to rule out other possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More waiting, more poking. Fine, Doctor. Do what you must. But I expect results quickly. And no unnecessary delays. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. This is all rather inconvenient. Can I at least get a written referral? My wife insists on… second opinions. It’s a long story. Just… get it done. Quickly. And tell me, honestly… is this going to interfere with my work? That’s what I truly want to know. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I'll arrange the blood tests immediately, and we’ll get the results back as quickly as possible – typically within 2-3 business days. I'll also write a referral for a dermatologist, just to get a second opinion, as your wife suggests. As for your work, it's difficult to say definitively at this point. We need to see the test results first. But, to be cautious, I would recommend minimizing strenuous activity until we have a clearer diagnosis. I'll also send the results directly to the dermatologist. Here are the lab requisition and the referral slip. Let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
