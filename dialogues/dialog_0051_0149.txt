DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, good morning to you. It’s not exactly a pleasure, you know. My niece insisted I come. Said I was being…difficult. Truth be told, I don’t even need a doctor. I’ve been a podiatrist for…oh, goodness, a lifetime. Longer than you’ve been alive, I’d wager. But she worries too much, that girl. Something about…not wanting to “intervene”? Honestly, sounds like nonsense to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when family members are worried, and you feel perfectly capable. Still, it's good to get things checked out, even if just for peace of mind. You were a podiatrist, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly capable is an understatement. I was one of the best! Back in…well, never you mind where. Point is, I’ve seen everything. Broken bones, infections, all sorts of…foot problems. And I fixed them! So, don’t tell me about feet, young man. It’s rather insulting, frankly. What exactly are you hoping to find? I haven’t been feeling particularly unwell, if you must know. Just…older. Which isn't a disease, last I checked.
DOCTOR: I certainly wasn’t trying to imply anything of the sort, Wynell. It’s quite impressive to have dedicated a lifetime to medicine – especially as a podiatrist. I apologize if I came across as dismissive. It’s just…sometimes even those with extensive medical backgrounds benefit from a fresh perspective. And you’re right, getting older isn’t a disease. But our bodies do change, and it’s good to understand those changes. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what prompted your niece to suggest you come in?
PATIENT: Prompted? Honestly, it was a fuss over a little…slowing down. I used to walk every morning, you see. A good brisk walk, rain or shine. Now, I take it a bit slower. And she says I’ve been “shuffling.” Shuffling! As if I’m some old…well, never you mind. She worries about me falling, I suppose. Says I need tests. All sorts of poking and prodding. It’s ridiculous. I haven't fallen once! Well...there was that time on the ice, but that was years ago, and it wasn’t my fault. The ice was slippery!
DOCTOR: So, the main concern seems to be a change in your gait – a bit of slowing down and some shuffling, as your niece described. And no falls recently, aside from the incident on the ice years ago. That’s good to hear. It’s understandable that she’s worried about you maintaining your independence. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmmph. Well, my memory isn’t what it used to be, that much is certain. I forget names, sometimes. And where I put things. The television remote is always hiding. But who doesn't misplace things? It's part of getting older, isn't it? Oh, and my feet…they ache a bit, especially in the evenings. But I’ve always had aches and pains. Comes with the territory, being on your feet all day for…well, a long time. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Wynell, those things are common as we get older. Memory lapses, aches and pains…they’re not necessarily cause for alarm. But it’s good to rule out anything more serious. You mentioned aches and pains in your feet, especially in the evenings. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well…it’s a dull ache, mostly. A throbbing, sometimes. Especially around the…the arches, I suppose. And the heels. They feel a bit tender. It’s worse after I’ve been standing for a while, or…well, after I’ve been doing anything, really. It doesn’t keep me up at night, but it’s…uncomfortable. It’s just…old age creeping in, I expect. Honestly, I've seen much worse in my practice. Broken toes, plantar fasciitis, bunions…you name it. This is nothing compared to those cases.
DOCTOR: A dull ache and throbbing in the arches and heels, worse after standing, and not disrupting your sleep. And you’ve seen much worse in your practice, certainly. That’s helpful context. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about other parts of your body. Have you noticed any pain in your hips, knees, or back?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well…my back aches a bit now and then. It's not constant, mind you. Mostly when I bend over to pick something up. It's just…stiffness, I suppose. And my knees…they creak a bit when I go up the stairs. Like old hinges, my niece says. She's always making little jokes. Honestly, I think she enjoys seeing me complain. It makes her feel…needed, perhaps. But yes, there's a bit of stiffness and creaking in the knees. But it's nothing I can't handle. I've been dealing with aches and pains my entire life.
DOCTOR: Aching in your back when bending, and creaking in your knees. It sounds like typical wear and tear, but it’s good to document everything. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm…sometimes, yes. My ankles sometimes look a little puffy at the end of the day. But I thought that was just…the heat, perhaps? Or maybe I ate something salty. I can't really say for certain. It comes and goes, really. Not enough to bother me much. I just put my feet up and it usually goes away. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to it. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Occasional puffiness in the ankles, relieved by elevating your feet. That’s helpful. Alright, Wynell, if you’re agreeable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion. And I'll take a look at your feet, of course. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All this poking and prodding… Honestly, I knew it would come to this. Very well. Get on with it, then. But don’t expect me to be impressed, young man. I've seen it all before. And don't tell me my reflexes are slow, I know they're not what they used to be. Just be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I promise. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/75, and your pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age, but still present. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. Could you please remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Be careful, young man. These feet have carried me a long way. They’re not as spry as they used to be, but they’ve seen a lot. And don’t poke too hard. I might just have to examine your feet next.
DOCTOR: I notice some slight swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. And there’s some tenderness when I press on the arches and heels of both feet. No signs of any open wounds or infection, which is good. Your toes look straight and healthy. Your range of motion is a little limited, but still adequate. Your sensation is intact. Alright, Wynell. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems consistent with typical wear and tear for someone your age. However, given the swelling and tenderness, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests just to rule out anything else. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Honestly, it never ends, does it? Very well. If you must. But don’t expect me to be grateful. It's just more poking and prodding, isn't it? I suppose it can't hurt. But if they find something, I'm blaming you. And don't tell me it's "routine." I know what routine is. It's a waste of time. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. And I assure you, these tests are just to be thorough. It’s not about finding something wrong, it's about having a complete picture and ruling out any less common causes of your symptoms. The tests I’d like to order are a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a C-reactive protein to check for inflammation. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw some blood. It’s a quick procedure. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your feet when possible, wearing comfortable, supportive shoes, and avoiding prolonged standing if it causes pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Elevate my feet… comfortable shoes… Honestly, I've been telling people this for fifty years. It's common sense, isn't it? But fine, I'll do it. Just to keep you happy. And no, I don't have any questions. You've poked and prodded enough for one day. Just get those tests done, and let me go home. I have a television show to watch, you know. And a remote to find.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I understand. I won't keep you any longer. The lab technician should be up shortly. They will explain the procedure to you. It was a pleasure meeting you, despite the…circumstances. And thank you for your patience. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe pain, redness, or swelling, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. .
PATIENT: Hmph. The pleasure was…minimal. And don't expect me to sing your praises if everything turns out fine. It's what I expected all along. Now, if you'll excuse me… Poking and prodding… honestly. Young people these days… .
