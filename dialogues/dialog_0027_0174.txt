DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… low, I suppose. I understand you’re here to help with things like this, yes? I’d like to get this sorted, if possible. I don’t have all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can certainly explore that. Feeling “not yourself” is a perfectly valid reason to seek medical attention. I appreciate you coming in. And I understand you’re short on time, I’ll do my best to be efficient. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about what “low” feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It's… a weight, Doctor. Like everything requires too much effort. Things I used to enjoy… the garden, even watching the news… they just don't hold my interest anymore. And I sleep… too much, sometimes. Other times, I can’t sleep at all. It’s very frustrating. It started… oh, maybe three months ago? After my grandson went off to university, I believe. Though, I shouldn't blame the boy, should I? He's a good lad.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not blaming anyone. Life changes can certainly affect us, and three months ago is helpful information. That sounds… difficult. A loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, changes in sleep… those are important things to discuss. So, you said it started around the time your grandson left for university. Was there anything else happening around that time?
PATIENT: Not that I can readily recall, no. My divorce… that was a good ten years ago now, and I’ve largely adjusted. I keep busy, you know? I volunteer at the community center, I… well, I used to ski patrol. Had to retire that last winter, though. Bad knee, you see. The doctor said it was time. That was… disappointing. But no, nothing else springs to mind that would coincide with this feeling. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for dwelling on things. I just want to feel like myself again, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. You've certainly been through some changes, and it sounds like you're a very resilient person. And wanting to feel like yourself again is a very reasonable goal. Let’s talk a little bit about your day-to-day life, just to get a better picture. Do you have much support from friends or family?
PATIENT: Well… my daughter calls occasionally. She’s very busy with work, you understand. And I see my grandson when he comes home for holidays. But mostly, I keep to myself. I have neighbours, of course, but we don’t… socialize much. I manage perfectly well on my own, always have. It’s just… quiet. Perhaps too quiet now. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone, you see. It’s why I hesitated so long to come here, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Nani. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things. Feeling isolated can definitely contribute to how you're feeling. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions, just to rule out any physical causes for your symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes, you know? Some days I have no interest in food at all. Other days, I eat… too much comfort food, perhaps. Biscuits, mostly. And yes, I’ve likely gained a few pounds. Nothing drastic, but noticeable. My clothes feel a bit tighter. It's not something I'm particularly proud of, but it’s the truth. Is that… relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's definitely relevant. Changes in appetite and weight are important pieces of the puzzle. Alright. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like headaches, dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue, certainly. A lot of it. I could sleep all day and still feel exhausted. Headaches… occasionally. Not severe, just a dull ache. I thought it was just from staring at the television too long, to be honest. And dizziness… sometimes when I stand up too quickly. It's nothing major, Doctor. I’m an older woman, you know. These things happen.
DOCTOR: Yes, those symptoms can occur as we age, but it's important to rule out any underlying causes. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about five years ago. I take medication for it, as prescribed. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. A bit of arthritis in my knees, of course, but that’s to be expected. Nothing else that I can readily recall. My doctor, Dr. Anya, always said I had a strong constitution. Though, she’s retired now.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see here your diagnosis of hypertension and your current medication, amlodipine 5mg daily. Good. And you mentioned arthritis. Do you take anything for that?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, as needed. Mostly when my knees are particularly painful after gardening. I try to avoid taking it too often, you know? It’s not good for the stomach. I manage, mostly. I just… pace myself. And I wear a knee brace when I’m doing anything strenuous. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Nani. It helps to get a clear picture. Now, one final quick question before we do a brief physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... Just a multivitamin, every morning with my breakfast. And occasionally, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take some Vitamin C. That’s it, Doctor. I don’t believe in loading up on pills. Natural is best, in my opinion. Though, I suppose the blood pressure medication is necessary.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. Alright. Well, Nani, based on what you've told me, you’ve been experiencing low mood, fatigue, changes in appetite and sleep, and some mild dizziness. It sounds like we need to explore a few possibilities. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Get it over and done with, I say. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have a bridge club meeting later, you see. I wouldn't want to miss that. Though, truthfully, even that doesn't sound appealing at the moment.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look in your ears and throat. Just a standard check-up. Alright, blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs sound clear... Do you have any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s alright. No pain. It feels… just like being poked, if I’m honest. I’ve had a lot of doctor visits over the years, you know. This all feels quite routine. Though, I must say, I’m not enjoying this particularly. Is there a swift conclusion in sight? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, almost done. Just checking your reflexes now… And everything seems normal there. Alright, everything appears physically normal. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other causes first, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood tests to check those levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Honestly, Doctor. I was hoping to avoid those. All that poking and prodding… But, if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. Get it over with, I say. Though, I must warn you, I’m not very good with needles. Is there… is there a way to make it less painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a lot on, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Nani. We can certainly try to make it as comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can use a numbing cream if you’d like. And we can draw as little blood as possible. The results usually take 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some options with you. We could consider some lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet. And if the blood tests confirm our suspicions, we could also discuss medication or therapy. Would you be open to exploring those options?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Therapy… Honestly, Doctor, I’ve lived a full life. I’ve seen enough therapists, done enough exercise. I just want to feel normal again. I don’t want to spend months talking about my feelings. Is there… is there a pill I can take? Something to just… lift my spirits? I’m not one for dwelling, you see. A quick fix, if possible. Though, I understand if that’s not realistic.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Nani. You’re right, there are medications that can help lift your spirits, but it’s important to understand they work best in combination with other strategies. We'd start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. Before we consider medication, let’s get those blood tests done. It’s important to rule out any other underlying causes first. I will write you a requisition and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Get the tests done. That's the most sensible thing. I suppose I can tolerate a bit more poking and prodding, if it means getting this sorted. Here, let me just get my coat… and the requisition, yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you not keeping me longer than necessary. Hopefully, we can get this over with quickly. I have a bridge club to attend, you know. A very important bridge club.
DOCTOR: Certainly. And I understand about your bridge club. I’ll get the lab results sent to me as soon as they’re available. I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment once I've had a chance to review them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Nani. And have a good time at your bridge club.
