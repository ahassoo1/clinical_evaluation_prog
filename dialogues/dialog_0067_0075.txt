DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tiredness during the day. Even though I’m using the machine every night, you see. The one for the…sleep apnea, that is. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the trick anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're still experiencing daytime tiredness despite using your CPAP machine for your sleep apnea. That's good information to start with. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up, but…it’s a struggle. You know, like wading through molasses. I have to really make myself concentrate, and even then, I find myself…drifting off in the afternoon. It’s mostly when I’m sitting, reading or watching the news. It's been going on for…oh, maybe a month or so now. I used to feel so much better after starting the machine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a struggle to stay focused and you’re experiencing this mostly when you’re sitting and relaxing, and it’s been happening for about a month. You noticed a change after initially feeling better with the CPAP. That's helpful. First, let's talk about the CPAP machine itself. Do you know what pressure it's set at?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I… honestly, I don’t. The technician set it up for me when I first got it, and I haven’t touched it since. I just plug it in and put on the mask. It has a little screen on it, but all I really look at is the hours I've used it. Is that bad? Should I know that number?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all that you don’t know the pressure setting. Many people don’t. It's good you’re using it consistently, though – that's the most important part. We should definitely check that pressure setting to make sure it’s still optimal for you. Before we do that, let’s talk a little bit more about your sleep. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my wife and I divorced a few years back, so I’ve been sleeping alone since then. So, no snoring complaints anymore, thankfully! But… I do get up to pee a couple of times most nights. Always have, really. It's just part of getting older, I suppose. And sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, even though I'm tired. Just my mind racing, you know? Thinking about things. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Getting up to urinate frequently at night, and having trouble falling asleep with a racing mind, are both important things to mention. So, to recap: You're experiencing daytime tiredness despite CPAP use, you're getting up to pee a couple of times a night, and you sometimes have trouble falling asleep due to racing thoughts. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor put me on a water pill for that years ago. And my cholesterol is a bit high too, but I try to watch my diet. Otherwise… I think I’m pretty healthy for an 83-year-old! I walk most days, if the weather's good, and I try to eat my vegetables. Oh, and I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. High blood pressure and cholesterol are important, and it's great that you're managing them with medication and lifestyle changes. Medicare is good information to have as well. Let's quickly go through a few other things. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back, that went well. Nothing else major, really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old!
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and cataract surgery. And yes, aches and pains are very common! Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything the doctors have given me. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. My wife, God rest her soul, was allergic to penicillin, but that's not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, besides the water pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the water pill, yes. A small, white one. And I take a multivitamin every day, but that's just for general health, you know? Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the water pill and a multivitamin. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Paske. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148/85. Your pulse is regular at 78. Your lungs are clear to auscultation – no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs. Your ears look clear, and your throat is clear as well. I don’t see any significant swelling in your legs or ankles. Now, given your symptoms and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It’s possible that your CPAP pressure needs adjusting, or that something else is going on contributing to your tiredness. I'm going to order a blood test to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and kidney function. I’m also going to order a sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and rule out any other sleep disorders. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests and another sleep study… whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate. My Medicare should cover all that, shouldn't it? I hope so…
DOCTOR: Yes, your Medicare should cover both the blood tests and the sleep study, although there may be a deductible or copay depending on your plan. We'll verify that with them before proceeding, of course, and our billing department can help you understand any potential costs. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use your CPAP machine as prescribed. And if your tiredness gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we’re looking into it. You’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I'm glad I could help. We'll get those tests ordered for you right away, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Here’s a summary of our plan and the orders we're submitting. Please take this with you. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
