DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Like, a long, long time ago. I hear they can do tests now, with spit… to see what people you are related to? I want to do that test.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing – learning more about your family’s origins through a DNA test, specifically a saliva test. That's becoming more common. Before we go ahead and order that for you, though, I want to make sure we cover a few things. It’s important to understand what those tests can and can’t tell you. And also, to make sure it’s appropriate for you, considering your overall health. First, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I feel good. Old, of course! But good. I make things with wood, you know? Little boats, little houses. Keeps my hands busy. No sickness, no big pain. Just… old. Is the test… hard? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re staying active and enjoying your hobbies! Woodworking is great for keeping the mind and hands sharp. And no, the test isn't hard at all! It doesn’t involve any needles. It's just a saliva sample – you’ll simply spit into a tube. The company sends you the kit, you mail it back, and they do the analysis. I see here you have Medicare. Most of these tests are not covered by Medicare, unfortunately, so we’d need to discuss the cost with you beforehand. Before we go further, can you tell me a little bit about why you’re interested in learning about your ancestry now?
PATIENT: Ah, okay, no needles, that's good. Cost… hmm. I have a little money saved. We can talk about that. Well… my mama, she told stories. About the islands, and the people. But she’s gone now. And I forget things. I want to know… for sure. About where I come from. For my heart, you know? And maybe… show my niece. She never met my mama.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. That's a very meaningful reason. It’s wonderful you want to preserve your family history and share it with your niece. It's perfectly normal to want to connect with your roots, especially as memories fade. Before we discuss specific testing companies and costs, let’s quickly review your medical history to make sure there aren’t any contraindications, just as a precaution. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I get itchy sometimes from the mosquitos on the islands, but that's not an allergy, right? Nothing the doctors ever told me about. I had a little trouble with my heart a long time ago, but they gave me some pills and I’m okay now. Been okay for many, many years. I don't take any pills now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies and no current medications. You mentioned a little trouble with your heart a long time ago. Do you recall what that was, approximately when it happened, and what kind of pills you were taking at the time, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time ago… maybe thirty years? More? I was living on Majuro then. The doctor said my heart was… beating too fast sometimes. Palpitations, he called it. I took little white pills. Small ones. I don’t remember the name. I stopped taking them after a while. He said I was better. I haven’t been back to a doctor since, until now. Mostly just the clinic nurse for my check-ups. Does that matter? For the spit test?
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations about thirty years ago, treated with medication you no longer take. It’s good you haven’t had any problems since then. While the information you've provided doesn't sound like a major contraindication for the spit test, it's always best to be cautious. Given your history of palpitations, I'd like to quickly check your heart rate and rhythm before proceeding, just to be on the safe side. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay, Doctor. If it makes you feel better. My heart feels good now. But check it if you want. Better safe than sorry, right? What does the test tell you, exactly? What kind of things will I find out? I mostly want to know about my ancestors, the people from the islands. But does it tell you other things?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Scobie. Better safe than sorry is always a good approach. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, please. Your heart rate is regular and sounds good. No murmurs or irregularities that I can detect at this time. Now, as for what the test can tell you, it depends on the company. Most of these tests analyze your DNA to estimate your ethnic origins – what percentage of your DNA comes from different regions around the world. They can often narrow it down to specific islands or groups of islands, which is what you’re hoping for. They can also tell you about potential relatives who have also taken the test – which is sometimes a fascinating part. Some tests also provide information about your predispositions to certain health conditions, but those results aren’t always definitive and should be discussed with a doctor. They cannot tell you about your individual ancestors by name, unfortunately. It’s more about broad ethnic groups. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad my heart sounds okay. Broad ethnic groups… hmm. I was hoping for names, but I guess that's too much to ask. Islands is good, though. That's what I really want. To know which islands my mama came from. And maybe find cousins? That would be nice. Which company do you think is best, Doctor? The one that tells you about the islands, and maybe find family? Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable goal, Mr. Scobie. For Marshallese ancestry, 23andMe and AncestryDNA are both popular options. AncestryDNA has a larger database, which increases your chances of finding relatives, but 23andMe often provides a slightly more detailed breakdown of ethnic origins. However, both have limitations when it comes to specific island ancestry, as their databases are still primarily focused on larger ethnic groups. The cost is around $99 to $199 for the basic test, depending on sales and whether you choose a subscription plan. The subscription plans offer additional features, like access to more detailed reports and genealogical records, but aren’t essential. I can provide you with brochures and links to both websites if you'd like. They both have very user-friendly interfaces and explain the process in detail. I recommend reading through their terms and conditions and privacy policies before making a decision. Also, keep in mind that these tests are not foolproof, and the results should be interpreted with caution. It's simply an estimate based on your DNA.
PATIENT: Brochures would be good, Doctor. Thank you. I'm not so good with computers. My niece helps me with those things. So, $100, about? That's okay. I can manage that. And it tells me about the islands… which ones? Does it show me pictures of the islands? I want to see where my mama came from. If it can, that is. And find family… that would be the best part, I think. Thank you, Doctor Alzoubi. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. Both 23andMe and AncestryDNA show you a map with an estimated breakdown of your ethnic origins. They may be able to pinpoint specific islands, but it depends on how well-represented those islands are in their database. They also often have historical information and photographs related to the regions your ancestry suggests. Finding family is, of course, not guaranteed, but the larger database of AncestryDNA does increase your chances. It’s best to manage your expectations, but it’s certainly a possibility. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Just the brochures, and to know it's okay to try. I’ll talk to my niece, and we’ll look at the computers together. Thank you very much. You’re a very kind doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions after you've had a chance to review the information with your niece. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy preserving your family history. .
