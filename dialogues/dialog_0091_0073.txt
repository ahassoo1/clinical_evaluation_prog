DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't really have time for pleasantries. It's…it's my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. It’s been going on for weeks, and nothing the other doctor gave me is working. Honestly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and that it’s uncomfortable to discuss these issues, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, this is a safe space, and we will get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. We’ll take things one step at a time. “Weeks,” you said. Could you describe when this first started and what a typical day looks like with this issue?
PATIENT: Ugh, “safe space.” Whatever. It started…probably around the end of June, maybe the first week of July. It's just…constant. I wake up needing to go, and then it's every couple of hours after that. I barely leave the house anymore. I can't even drink a full cup of coffee without regretting it. It’s ruining everything. I used to be able to… well, never mind. It's just a mess. And I'm tired of explaining it to people.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Woodring. It sounds incredibly disruptive to your life, and I understand your desire for a resolution. So, beginning around the end of June, early July, you’ve experienced frequent bowel movements, requiring you to use the restroom often, impacting your ability to leave the house and enjoy things like a full cup of coffee. Could you describe the bowel movements themselves?
PATIENT: Look, do I have to? This is…personal. Fine. They're…watery. Really watery. And…a lot of them. It's not like normal, you know? It’s just…gushing. And sometimes there’s cramping. Bad cramping. Like, I have to lie down. Is that enough detail for you? Honestly, I don’t see how knowing exactly what’s coming out of me is going to help.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, the details are important for understanding the cause of your symptoms. It’s not about dwelling on the specifics, but about gathering information to arrive at the correct diagnosis. “Watery,” and frequent, with cramping significant enough to require you to lie down. Thank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. No blood. Look, if there was blood, I would have gone to the emergency room already. I'm not completely ignorant. It's just…constant diarrhea, okay? Not some dramatic emergency. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just trying to scare me?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Woodring, I am not attempting to scare you. I am simply gathering information to assess the situation accurately. The absence of blood is helpful to know. “Constant diarrhea,” as you described. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside this?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little bit of nausea, but it's probably just from…well, everything. And no vomiting. I haven't thrown up once. I just feel weak and exhausted, and I've lost a few pounds, which is the last thing I needed. Honestly, it feels like I'm just…wasting away. Can we please get to the point? What are you thinking this is?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire for answers, Ms. Woodring. We are getting to the point. No fever, minimal nausea, no vomiting, and you’ve experienced some weakness and weight loss. Before we discuss potential causes, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Okay, fine. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. And…I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but I don't really take anything for it. It's usually fine if I watch my salt. Other than that…no. And I’m Tlingit, if that matters. My grandmother always said…well, it doesn’t matter. Look, I’m a pretty healthy person normally. This is just…weird. Are you going to ask about my diet now? Because I swear…
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. Gallbladder removal ten years ago, diagnosed with high blood pressure but currently unmedicated, and identifying as Tlingit. It’s helpful to know. Knowing your cultural background can sometimes be relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. And yes, I do need to ask about your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. The diet lecture. Fine. I usually have coffee and toast for breakfast. Lunch is…whatever I can grab. Sometimes a sandwich, sometimes leftovers. Dinner is usually fish – salmon, mostly. I try to eat healthy. I grew up eating traditional foods, but I mostly just get it from the store now. I don’t drink a lot of soda, and I don’t eat a lot of junk food. Honestly, I’m probably healthier than most people. This whole thing is just ridiculous. I'm starting to feel like you don't believe me. Are you suggesting I’m making this up?
DOCTOR: I absolutely believe you, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my questions are giving that impression. I am not suggesting you are making this up in any way. I simply need a complete picture of your health to understand what might be going on. So, coffee and toast for breakfast, variable lunch, and mostly salmon for dinner. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't really take anything. Maybe some ibuprofen for a headache now and then, but that's it. I don't like taking pills. Honestly, I think I'm allergic to a lot of them. I had a bad reaction to something a few years back, so I just avoid them. And I definitely don't take any of those fancy vitamins or supplements. That’s all nonsense, if you ask me. Can we just skip this part? I feel like we're going in circles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the repetitive questioning. It’s important to document everything, even what you aren’t taking. So, infrequent ibuprofen use, with a history of a previous adverse reaction to an unspecified medication. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Family history? What are you, a detective now? Fine. My mother had…high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother had diabetes. That’s about it, as far as I know. My dad died when I was young, so I don’t really know much about his side of the family. Honestly, we didn't really talk about health stuff much. Can we please get to the point? I’m starting to feel really lightheaded. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and apologize if this feels intrusive. It’s important to gather a complete picture of your health history. So, a family history of high blood pressure in your mother, and diabetes in your grandmother. I’m noting your feeling of lightheadedness. I want to ensure your safety. May I check your blood pressure and pulse at this time?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. But if I faint, I’m blaming you. Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole thing is just stress. My life has been really…difficult lately. But I don't need a doctor to tell me that. Just hurry up, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148/92, and your pulse is 88. That's consistent with some stress, but also warrants attention. Now, to try and get a better understanding of your condition, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination of your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Seriously? Fine. But be gentle, okay? I don't like being touched. And if it hurts, I'm telling you. I swear. Just…get it over with. But honestly, I still think this is just stress. A little vacation is what I need. Not a doctor's visit. But go ahead, I guess. Just…don't be rough.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Woodring, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses. Okay. I'm noting some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. There’s no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now… …they are hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. Your abdomen is soft, but I can feel some mild distention.
PATIENT: Distention? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Honestly, this is making me really nervous. Are you going to send me to the hospital? I don't have time for that. I have…things to do. Just tell me what you think it is, okay? And no medical jargon, please. I want to understand what's going on. And if it's serious, just be honest with me. But if it's nothing, just tell me that too. Please. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: “Distention” simply means your abdomen feels slightly swollen. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s something I need to note. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the examination, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a viral or bacterial gastroenteritis – essentially, a stomach bug – which is causing the diarrhea and cramping. However, the persistence of your symptoms for weeks, and the lack of improvement with previous treatment, suggests we need to investigate further. Another possibility is Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, which can cause similar symptoms. Less commonly, it could be a sign of a more significant issue, like Inflammatory Bowel Disease. To help determine the cause, I’d like to order some laboratory tests. These will include a stool sample to check for infection, and blood work to evaluate your overall health and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? A stool sample? Are you serious? This is ridiculous. I knew I should have just stayed home and taken some Imodium. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. I don't want to spend my whole life getting poked and prodded and running tests. I just want this to go away. But…fine. If you think it's necessary, I guess. But if it turns out to be nothing, I'm sending you the bill for my wasted time. Just…hurry up and get it over with. And tell me exactly what I need to do. Don't leave anything out. I'm not going back in here again if I forget something. This is… exhausting. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary to get you a diagnosis and help you feel better. I'll have the nurse provide you with the collection kit and instructions for the stool sample. It's a simple process, and the nurse will walk you through it. For the blood work, we can draw it here in the office. It will take only a few minutes. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, please ensure you’re staying hydrated. Small, frequent sips of clear fluids are best. And try to eat bland foods – toast, rice, bananas – that are gentle on your stomach. Do you have any questions about the tests, or anything else we’ve discussed?
