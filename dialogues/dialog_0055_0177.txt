DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... what did bring me in? It's this... thing. Down there. It's... leaking. That's what my niece told me to say. She's a nurse, you know. Smart girl. It's been happening a little while now, I think. Not a lot, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” you say. Very well. Could you be more specific, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Specific? Well... it's not water. Definitely not water. It's… kinda sticky. And it smells a little funny, if you ask me. Not like flowers, that's for sure. It's just… coming out. From… there. I don't know what else to tell ya. It’s always been a little… sensitive, but this is new.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And for how long has this… discharge been occurring, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… A few weeks, maybe? Could be longer, hard to say. I don’t really keep track of things like that, you know? It just started bothering me more recently. When I went swimming with my grandkids, I think. It smelled… worse then. That's when I really noticed it. That's why I called my niece.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… not really. A little bit of a… burning feeling sometimes, when I go to the bathroom. But I get that sometimes anyway, you know? Old age. And… maybe a little tired. But who isn’t tired these days? No, I don’t think so. Just the leaking and the smell. That’s pretty much it. Is that all you need to know? It's embarrassing to talk about, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary… habits? You mean… going to the bathroom? What do you mean, “changes”? I go when I need to go! Like everybody else. Maybe I’ve been going a little more often lately, now that you mention it. But that could be all the iced tea I've been drinking. It’s hot out, you know! I don't know what kind of question that is, Doctor. It just feels… rude.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Genard. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, now! That is a personal question, young lady! What kind of doctor asks something like that?! I came here because of a… a leak, not to be interrogated! Honestly, I think I want to see another doctor. This is just… inappropriate. I haven’t even gotten a proper greeting, and now you’re asking me about that?!
DOCTOR: Please, Ms. Genard, do remain seated. It is standard procedure to gather a complete medical history, and these questions are pertinent to determining the cause of your… issue. It is not my intention to offend you. However, I assure you, it is necessary for proper diagnosis. Perhaps we should proceed with a physical examination?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? You want to look at it? Absolutely not! No, thank you. I don’t even know you, young lady. And I’m not comfortable with that at all. I think I've said enough. I want a referral. To a male doctor. Someone who understands some… boundaries. This is ridiculous. I'm leaving now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Genard. I will provide you with a referral to a specialist of your choosing. Here is a list of physicians in the area. Please schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. I wish you well. .
