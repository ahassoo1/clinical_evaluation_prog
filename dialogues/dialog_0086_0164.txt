DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and sort of yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I didn't think beans could do this to a person! It's been happening for a few times now, and I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Tired and… yellow?
PATIENT: Yes, tired like… really dragging. And my skin and the whites of my eyes… they get a yellowish tint. Not bright yellow, but noticeable, you know? It fades after a while, but it’s worrying me. And like I said, it always seems to be after I eat fava beans. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" is a relative term, Ms. Haggar. It’s… unusual, certainly. Fava beans causing fatigue and jaundice… that does raise a flag. We need to explore this further. Let's start with some basics. When you say "after you eat fava beans," how long after eating them does this typically begin?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It's usually within a few hours, I think. Maybe 3-4 hours after I eat them? Sometimes it feels quicker, but it's hard to be precise. It's not instant, but definitely not the next day or anything. It kind of builds slowly, the tiredness first, and then the yellowing starts.
DOCTOR: Alright, 3-4 hours… that's helpful. And how much fava beans are you typically eating when this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, not a huge amount, Doctor. I like them in salads, or sometimes just a small side dish. Maybe… a cup or so? Cooked, usually. I don't eat them every day, maybe once or twice a week, if that makes sense. I just really enjoy them when they’re fresh.
DOCTOR: A cup… right. Ms. Haggar, while I appreciate your detailed recollection, it's rather… peculiar to attribute these symptoms to a single ingredient in your diet. However, let's rule things out systematically. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and yellowing?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it like that, it does sound silly, doesn’t it? I just thought… it always happens after the beans. Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit weak, kind of shaky, especially when I'm tired. And… I’ve noticed my pee is darker than usual, a sort of… brownish colour. Is that relevant? I don’t usually pay much attention to things like that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and weakness… yes, that is relevant. And, frankly, more concerning. It sounds like we need to investigate a possible hemolytic anemia, potentially linked to a G6PD deficiency. It's relatively rare, but common in certain populations. Now, have you had any prior medical issues?
PATIENT: G6PD… what's that? I'm sorry, I don’t really understand all the medical terms. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything serious, no. I had the flu a couple of years ago, and a bad backache last winter, but nothing chronic. I’m generally pretty healthy, or I thought I was, anyway. And I’ve never had a blood transfusion or anything like that.
DOCTOR: G6PD deficiency is an enzyme deficiency that can cause your red blood cells to break down, especially when exposed to certain triggers – like fava beans. It’s hereditary. Alright. Have either of your parents had any health problems you know of?
PATIENT: That sounds… scary. Red blood cells breaking down? Oh dear. Let me think… my mother passed away a few years ago, she had high blood pressure, I think, and some arthritis. My father… he was healthy for most of his life, but he had some problems with his liver towards the end, but the doctors never really explained it well. He lived in Romania all his life, and things were… different there, you know? Not much talk about specifics. I don’t know if either of them had any… enzyme deficiencies, or anything like that. They weren’t really the type to go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, arthritis, and potential liver issues… noted. We'll need to consider a genetic predisposition. Now, before we go further, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s it. And I haven’t taken anything for a cold or anything like that in months. Just… try to rest and drink tea when I’m feeling unwell, that sort of thing. I really don't like taking pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, occasional multivitamin. Good. Now, Ms. Haggar, I’m going to need to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. The tests will include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. We'll also check your bilirubin levels, as that will help explain the yellowing. Can I proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on and feel better. Blood tests are fine, a physical exam is fine. Please, just let me know if anything is… alarming. And what exactly does a G6PD enzyme assay do? I’m sorry to keep asking, I just like to understand what’s happening to my body.
DOCTOR: It measures the level of the G6PD enzyme in your blood. A low level suggests a deficiency. It's a standard test. Alright, let’s start with the exam. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen to check your liver and spleen. Then we'll draw some blood. It’s fairly routine. If you could just loosen your clothing… and please, try not to worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Loosening my clothing… here we go. I'm trying not to worry, but it's hard, you know? Especially with the red blood cells breaking down… it sounds frightening. I do trust you, though. Just… tell me if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. A little bit… sensitive maybe, on the right side, but not painful. It feels… a bit full, if that makes sense? Like I’ve eaten too much, even though I haven’t. It's probably just my imagination. Oh, maybe there… just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the right upper quadrant… possibly some hepatomegaly, though it’s subtle. Liver may be slightly enlarged. I’m going to need to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder. While I do this, is there anything else you’ve noticed, anything at all, that you haven’t mentioned yet?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit nauseous lately. Not every day, but maybe a couple of times a week. And I’ve lost my appetite a little bit. I just thought it was… stress. Work has been busy. And sometimes, my urine is…foamy. It's strange. I didn't think that was normal either. I feel like I'm just listing odd symptoms now, and I'm probably making things worse.
DOCTOR: Nausea, loss of appetite, foamy urine… yes, that's more relevant, Ms. Haggar. It paints a clearer picture. The foamy urine suggests protein in your urine, which, combined with the other symptoms, raises concerns about possible kidney involvement. Alright, I've ordered the complete blood count, liver function tests, G6PD assay, and abdominal ultrasound. We'll need a urine analysis as well. I'm also ordering a protein electrophoresis to assess the protein levels in your urine. You'll need to go to the lab downstairs. They'll take blood and a urine sample. The results should be back in a few days. Once I have them, we'll discuss them and determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Blood, urine, ultrasound… I’ll go downstairs right now. Thank you for listening, and for taking everything seriously. It’s… a lot to take in. I hope it's not anything too serious. I'll see you in a few days, then.
