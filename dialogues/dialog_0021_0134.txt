DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…well, it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling quite poorly these past few weeks. Not strong, you know? And I don’t seem to be able to eat much at all before I feel full. It’s…peculiar. I can’t rightly say when it started, exactly. Seems like a long time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “not strong” and feeling full quickly… a few weeks, you said. It's good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about what "poorly" feels like?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not pain, exactly. More like…a queasiness. Like I might be sick to my stomach, but I usually…don’t. It just sits there, this…uncomfortable feeling. And then, like I said, even a little bit of food…fills me right up. It’s a bother, really. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now…not so much. My appetite just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no actual vomiting, just nausea and early fullness. And a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… I've been…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But at my age, aren’t we always a little tired? I don't know if that’s…related. And…oh dear. Now what was I saying? I just…forget things so easily these days. It’s dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue. It could be related, Ms. Kelder. We'll try to sort through it. And it's perfectly normal to experience some memory changes with age. Now, besides the fatigue and stomach issues, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, now that you mention it… my clothes have been feeling a little looser. I hadn’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I just figured… well, I haven't been eating much. I used to weigh a good bit more, so maybe it’s not a bad thing. But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that makes sense. It just…happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, so unintentional weight loss along with the nausea, early fullness, and fatigue. That's…concerning enough that we should investigate further. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bowel habits… Now that’s a subject. I… well, let’s just say they haven’t been regular. Mostly…constipation, I think. It's been difficult. And uncomfortable. I’ve been trying to drink more water, but it doesn't seem to help much. It’s been going on for…oh, I don’t know. A while now. Everything feels like a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constipation on top of everything else. Any blood in your stool, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Blood…? Oh my. No, dear, not that I’ve noticed. I…I always check, you know? After. But no. No blood. Just…well, you know. Hard to pass. It’s not something I particularly enjoy talking about. But I’m trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder, and you are being very helpful. One last question for now. Do you have any family history of stomach problems, like stomach cancer, or problems with digesting food?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she was sick for a long time, when I was a little girl. She had trouble eating, I remember that much. They didn't really say what was wrong with her, back then. It was… a long time ago. And my Uncle Silas, on my father’s side… he had something with his belly, I think. They took him to the hospital. But I don’t know what it was. I was just a child. It wasn’t a happy time. I wish I remembered more. It’s all so…fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Ms. Kelder, based on what you’ve told me – the nausea, early fullness, unintentional weight loss, constipation, fatigue, and a vague family history of digestive issues – I think we need to do a few tests to figure out what’s going on. I'm concerned about the possibility of something more serious.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests? Serious…? What kind of tests, dear? Will they…hurt? I don't do well with pain. And…what are you thinking it could be? I'm not good with these things. I get so frightened easily.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be frightened, Ms. Kelder. We're going to take things one step at a time. The first thing I want to do is a blood test to check for anemia and other things. I also want to order a stool test to look for any signs of bleeding or infection. And, to get a better look at what's going on in your stomach, I'd like to order an upper endoscopy. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus and stomach to look for any abnormalities. It's usually well-tolerated, but you will be sedated for it. We’ll talk more about the preparation if we decide to go that route. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh my… a tube… in my stomach? Sedated…? It sounds…frightening, dear. Very frightening. What are you looking for? What if you find something…bad? Will it hurt? I really don’t do well with pain. And I get so nervous… Is there…is there another way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. The endoscopy is the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. We are looking for things like ulcers, inflammation, or any signs of tumors. I want to be clear, it doesn't mean you have any of those things, but we need to rule them out given your symptoms and family history. As for pain, you won't feel anything during the procedure because of the sedation. It's similar to having a very light anesthetic. And we’ll have you monitored closely throughout. There are other tests we could do, like a CT scan, but they aren't as accurate as an endoscopy. We could also try a trial of medication for your symptoms, but that wouldn’t tell us what’s causing them. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I believe an endoscopy is the most responsible course of action. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That sounds… a lot. A lot to take in. Tumors… that’s…a frightening word. And being sedated… I don’t like feeling out of control. If it's the best way, I suppose… but could we… could we start with just the blood test? And maybe the stool test? I need to… process things slowly. Just one step at a time. I don’t want to be rushed. And…what if it is something bad? What would happen then? I don't want to think about it, but I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. We can absolutely start with the blood test and stool test. That's a perfectly reasonable approach. It will give us some initial information and allow you time to process things. We'll schedule those for you today. As for what would happen if it is something serious… it depends on what we find. If it's an ulcer, we can treat it with medication. If it's a tumor… there are various treatment options available, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. We would discuss all of those options with you in detail and help you make the best decision for your health. I would also refer you to a specialist, a gastroenterologist and potentially an oncologist, if necessary. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll start with the tests, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds okay. One step at a time. Will the tests… take long? And will they hurt? I know you said not during the endoscopy, but… the blood test… and the stool test…? I worry about these things, you know. It’s just… I’m an old woman. I’ve lived a long life, but… I’m still frightened.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly natural to be frightened. The blood test will only take a few minutes, just a quick prick of a needle. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt. As for the stool test, it's a simple collection process. You’ll receive a kit and instructions on how to collect a sample at home. It’s not painful at all. We’ll get you scheduled for the blood test right away, and I'll have the nurse explain everything to you in detail. She’s very good at making people feel comfortable. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. We're here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just…thank you, dear. For being patient with me. And for explaining things. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose… I suppose I’m ready for the blood test. If you think it’s best. I just…hope everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kelder. That's what I'm here for. And I understand your anxiety. Let’s get you set up for the blood test, and then we'll go from there. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain everything to you. She’ll take good care of you. And remember, we don't know anything for sure yet. We're just gathering information. We’ll take it one step at a time.
