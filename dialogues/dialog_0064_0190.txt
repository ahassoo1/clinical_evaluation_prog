DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s not constant, but… it’s concerning. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Perhaps a few weeks ago? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: A few weeks ago… alright. Unsteadiness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… like losing my balance for a moment. Not falling, usually, but feeling like I might. It happens most often when I’m… walking, I suppose. Or sometimes just standing. It’s quite disruptive, especially with my line of work. I operate a rotary drill, you see, and… well, needing a steady hand is rather important.
DOCTOR: I see. A rotary drill… that does require a good deal of steadiness. And it's happening primarily when walking or standing. Is it associated with any dizziness, or anything else that happens at the same time – like blurry vision, ringing in your ears, nausea, or headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, I don't believe so. No dizziness, not exactly. Sometimes… a slight feeling of… lightness, perhaps? But not like I'm going to faint. And no blurry vision, no ringing, and thankfully, no nausea or headache. It’s mostly just the feeling of being… off-balance. It’s rather frustrating, because I can’t pinpoint anything with it, you see? It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. No associated symptoms… that makes it a bit trickier, but we’ll get to the bottom of it. Just the unsteadiness itself. Now, have you noticed any patterns?
PATIENT: Patterns…? I’m not sure I have, truthfully. It doesn’t seem to be worse at a certain time of day, or after eating, or with any particular activity besides walking and standing. Sometimes it happens when I’m quite tired, but other times I feel perfectly rested. It’s… random, I suppose. It feels terribly inconvenient, but I haven’t been able to identify anything that triggers it. It’s been… quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lilyanna. It's unsettling when something happens without a clear cause. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit difficult. My husband… he handled most of that, you see. He passed away last year. I believe I’m generally healthy, but I don’t recall specific diagnoses. I do have private insurance, so I’ve had regular check-ups, but… I don’t have the records with me. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a partner is incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly alright if you don't have everything at your fingertips right now. We can access your records through your insurance. In the meantime, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been… rather fortunate in that regard. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I broke my wrist once, when I was a child, but that healed quickly. Nothing since then, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries, no hospitalizations, just a childhood wrist fracture. And you said you have private insurance and have had regular check-ups. That’s good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, neurological problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we aren’t very forthcoming with medical information. It’s… a cultural thing, I suppose. We don’t discuss illness much. I know my mother had high blood pressure, but beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much to tell you. There haven't been any… obvious hereditary conditions that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. We'll work with what we have. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I haven't needed any medication, thankfully. Not even over-the-counter things, usually. Perhaps some pain relievers for a headache, occasionally, but nothing regular. And no supplements. I prefer to… rely on good food and rest, when possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No medications or supplements. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. No known allergies. I’ve always been rather lucky in that regard as well. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any reactions to anything, as far as I’m aware. No, I don’t recall any allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Thank you for that information. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your balance, coordination, reflexes, and blood pressure. It’s nothing to worry about, just a routine assessment to help us figure out what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement completely. I just… I want to understand what’s happening, and hopefully find a solution.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Now, let’s check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular and strong. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly. Good. Now, can you close your eyes and extend your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. Is everything alright? I do feel… a little unsteady, even now.
DOCTOR: I see a slight tremor in your right hand, and a bit of difficulty maintaining a straight line. Now, I’m going to check your gait. Could you please walk a few steps forward, and then turn around and walk back?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I… I do feel rather clumsy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Thank you. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. This will involve a small tap on your knees and ankles. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I trust your judgement. Just… let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m a bit nervous, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished bilaterally, but within normal limits. Now, let's check your… …your cranial nerves. This involves following my finger with your eyes as I move it in different directions. It helps assess your eye movements and nerve function. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes only, keeping your head still?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m following your finger. Is that alright? It feels… a little strange, but I’m doing my best to keep my head still.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your eye movements appear normal. Now, one last thing. Could you please tell me if you've experienced any changes in your vision, speech, or swallowing recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No changes at all. My vision is the same as always, my speech is clear, and I haven’t had any difficulty swallowing. Everything feels… normal in that regard. It’s just this unsteadiness that’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. Thank you for your patience. Based on the examination, your blood pressure and pulse are normal, your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits, and your cranial nerves appear intact. The primary findings are the unsteadiness you described, the slight tremor in your right hand, and the tendency to lean during gait. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a vestibular issue – a problem with the inner ear that affects balance. It could also be related to some mild neurological issues. However, without further testing, it’s difficult to say for certain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend a comprehensive blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and an MRI of the brain to assess your neurological function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, I believe so. Blood tests are fine as well. Whatever is necessary to find out what’s happening, Doctor. I just… I want to understand what’s going on and hopefully find a solution. It’s been quite unsettling living with this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilyanna. Uncertainty is unsettling. The blood tests will give us a baseline, and the MRI will provide a more detailed view of your brain. I'll write the orders for both now. The blood tests can be done at the lab downstairs, and they'll only take a few minutes. The MRI will require an appointment, and it's best to do it as soon as possible. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. I recommend avoiding any activities that could increase your risk of falling, such as climbing ladders or operating heavy machinery. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as dizziness, blurred vision, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. Avoiding activities that could cause a fall… that’s sensible. I’ll certainly do that. It’s just… I worry about my work. But I suppose my health is the most important thing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your thoroughness. I trust your judgement completely. What’s the next step, after the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. Your health is the most important thing, and you're right to prioritize that. After the tests, we’ll review the results together. If the blood tests are normal, and the MRI shows no abnormalities, we may consider this to be a benign issue, perhaps related to mild vestibular dysfunction. We can then discuss some exercises and therapies to help improve your balance. However, if the tests reveal any abnormalities, we’ll need to investigate further and discuss appropriate treatment options. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a week, once the results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. Do you have any limitations at work that I should document for a potential short-term note?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Operating the rotary drill requires precise movements and a steady hand, which… is becoming increasingly difficult. I can still perform some lighter tasks, but anything involving heavy machinery or heights is… out of the question. Perhaps a note stating that I have a temporary balance issue and should avoid those specific tasks would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll document that you have a temporary balance issue requiring avoidance of tasks involving precise movements, heights, and operating heavy machinery. Here’s a copy for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time, your patience, and your thoroughness. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. I appreciate your help very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take it easy, avoid activities that could increase your risk of falling, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
