DOCTOR: Hi Betty, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are a bit muffled, like talking through cotton. Not sure when it started, really. A little bit at a time, I suppose. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual muffling of sound… that's helpful to know. It is common for hearing to change as we get older. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. When you say “a little bit at a time,” can you give me a sense of how long ago you first noticed this?
PATIENT: Oh dear... how long ago? That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a good while now. Maybe a year? Two? I used to be able to hear the birds so clear in the morning, but now… not so much. I don’t watch much television, so I didn’t really notice it at first, I don't think. I mostly just… get by.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year or two… that gives us a starting point. And it’s good you mention the birds – that’s a specific example. So, it's definitely impacting your ability to hear everyday sounds. Is it worse in one ear than the other, or about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think maybe my left ear is a bit worse. It’s hard to tell, honestly. I tend to turn my head a lot to hear better, if that makes any sense. I don’t think it’s a big difference, but… maybe a little. It’s just… quiet, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, turning your head to hear better is a common sign. Alright, let's do a quick check of your ears. I'm just going to take a look with this light and an instrument called an otoscope. It doesn't hurt, I promise. Just relax and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Could you tell me if you’ve had any ear pain, drainage, ringing in your ears, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Oh, ear pain… no, not really. No drainage either. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? A little bit of a hum, but I figured that was just… old age, you know? It comes and goes. Dizziness… well, I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I chalk that up to my knees, mostly. They aren’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of ringing, and the unsteadiness you attribute to your knees… good to know. Let’s take a look in those ears. Okay… I’m seeing a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled sound. The ear canals themselves look okay, no obvious signs of infection. Your eardrums look a little… dull, but that isn't necessarily concerning on its own. I’m going to perform a quick hearing test now, just to get a better idea of the extent of the hearing loss. It’s simple – I’ll put headphones on you and play some tones, and you just let me know when you hear them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Wax… well, I don’t do much cleaning, I suppose. Never thought about it much. A hearing test… yes, that sounds fine. Headphones… I used to have a nice pair, but they broke years ago. Just let me know if it’s loud, alright? I don’t want to startle myself.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll keep the volume at a comfortable level, and we can stop at any time. Okay… just raise your hand when you hear a tone, any tone at all. Don’t worry if you miss some. Alright, the test indicates some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies in both ears, and slightly more pronounced in your left ear, as you mentioned. This is fairly common with age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it's good we've identified it. Given the wax buildup and the test results, I think a simple wax removal might help improve your hearing. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… complicated. Wax removal… what does that involve? Is it… painful? I don’t like things poked and prodded, you know. And is this something I have to do often?
DOCTOR: No, it's not complicated at all, and it’s generally not painful. We can use a few different methods. The simplest is usually irrigation – gently flushing the ear canal with warm water. It might feel a little strange, like bubbles popping, but it shouldn’t hurt. I can also use special tools to gently remove the wax if you prefer. As for how often you'd need it, that depends on how quickly the wax builds up again. Some people only need it done once, others a few times a year. We can discuss that after we’ve removed the wax and see how your hearing is. Would you like to try the irrigation first?
PATIENT: Irrigation… warm water, you say? That sounds… better than poking. Still a bit nervous, but… alright. If you think that’s best. Just… be gentle, please? And tell me what you’re doing as you go, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain every step as I go, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Okay, Betty. I'm going to warm up some water to body temperature. It's very important that it's not too hot or too cold. Then, I’ll gently flush your ear canal with the water. You might hear a little bit of swishing and popping, and possibly feel some pressure. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll start with your left ear, since that’s the one you mentioned having more trouble with. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a bit strange, alright. Warm… and swishing, like you said. A little bit of pressure, yes. Not painful, just… odd. I can feel the water moving around. Is it… working? Is the wax coming out?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's working. I can see some wax fragments starting to come out. It may take a few minutes to remove all of it. Okay… I think we've gotten the bulk of it out of your left ear. Let me take a look. Alright, that looks much better. The canal is clearer now. Let's move on to your right ear and do the same thing. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. A bit uncomfortable, but… manageable. My left ear feels a little… lighter, maybe? Hard to explain. Yes, go ahead with the right ear. Hopefully it won’t take as long.
DOCTOR: Alright. It might not take as long, yes. Okay… and how’s that feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that one seems a bit easier, actually. Not much pressure at all. Just warm water… and a little bit of swishing. Yes, that's alright. It doesn’t feel blocked anymore, if that makes sense. Is it… done?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think we're done. Let me take a look and see. Alright, both canals are nice and clear now. The wax is gone. Now, let's repeat that quick hearing test to see if there's any improvement. Just raise your hand when you hear a tone, any tone at all. Don't worry if you miss some. Okay… excellent! Your hearing has improved in both ears, especially in the higher frequencies. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely better. Do you notice a difference?
PATIENT: Oh… my. Yes! Yes, I do! Things sound… brighter, somehow. Clearer. I can hear the hum of the machine in the room now, I couldn't before. And… I think I can hear you a bit better too. That’s wonderful! It's not perfect, but it’s a big improvement. Thank you, Doctor. That was very kind of you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I'm glad we were able to help. Now, to prevent the wax from building up again, I recommend using these ear drops once a week. They'll help soften the wax and prevent it from becoming impacted. Also, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to check your hearing and make sure everything is still going well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, ear drops… once a week, you say? Yes, I can do that. I’ll put a reminder on my calendar right away. And six months… yes, that sounds sensible. Just to make sure everything stays alright. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman like me. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or… anything I should be avoiding?
DOCTOR: You're not an "old woman" at all, Betty! And you're very welcome. As for things to avoid, try to avoid using cotton swabs in your ears. They can actually push the wax further in and cause more problems. Also, if you're around loud noises, consider wearing earplugs to protect your hearing. Otherwise, just continue using the ear drops as directed, and let me know if you experience any pain, drainage, or changes in your hearing. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. No cotton swabs… I’ll remember that. And earplugs for loud noises… good advice. My grandson takes me to concerts sometimes, so that’s useful to know. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been a great help. Now, I think I’d better be going. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’m glad I could help. Here’s a card with the clinic’s number and address. Feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and enjoy your time with your grandson! And remember those earplugs.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you kindly. I will. And I shall remember the earplugs! You have a good day now, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. .
