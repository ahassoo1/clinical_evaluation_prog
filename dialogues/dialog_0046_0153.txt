DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Glowka, you said? Yes, yes... It’s… something about a check-up? For… work. A performance thing. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. They just told me to come in for clearance, I think. A physical. Is that right? I work at the theatre, you see. Mostly just showing people to their seats, taking tickets... that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, a physical examination for work clearance is perfectly reasonable. We'll certainly get that sorted out for you. It sounds like a fairly active role at the theatre, even if it’s primarily ushering. Just to clarify, has anything specific prompted this request for a clearance now?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… not that I recall. Everything’s been… normal, I suppose. Old age creeping up on me, that’s probably it. I haven’t been feeling ill, if that’s what you mean. Just… tired, maybe? But I’ve always been a bit tired. Honestly, I couldn't tell you what changed. They just sent a notice. A form. Said I needed to get checked out. It's probably just a formality.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No specific complaints, just general fatigue. We will certainly do a thorough check-up to ensure everything is functioning as it should be. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s… a long time ago. I haven’t really been to the doctor in… well, decades, probably. Let me think… I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix taken out when I was in my thirties, but that was ages ago. And… I think I had a bad back once, but that healed. I don't remember much else, truthfully. I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. We’ll take our time. So, appendix removed in your thirties, and a back issue that resolved. Do you recall approximately when that back issue occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that was… probably in the late seventies, maybe early eighties? I was working a different job then, a delivery service. Lots of lifting. It was a strain, that’s all. Nothing broken, I don’t think. Just a lot of aches and pains. I saw a chiropractor for a while, and it got better. It hasn’t bothered me in years. Honestly, I'm terrible with dates. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll focus on what’s relevant now. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s a bit sad, actually. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. Both of them. I had a younger sister, but we… we lost touch years ago. Haven’t spoken to her in… decades. I was never very good at keeping up with people, I'm afraid. Divorced, you know. No children. So, not much family to speak of, really. I mostly keep to myself these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements… I try to eat healthy, but mostly just regular food. I drink tea, a lot of tea. That’s about it. I really don’t bother with much else.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing. Nothing serious. I don’t have any skin allergies, or food sensitivities… No, I think I’m pretty clear. I’m a fairly simple man, you see. Don't have many… complications.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never. Always hated it. Always thought it was a terrible habit. My parents didn’t smoke, and I just never picked it up. Never even been tempted, truthfully. I try to stay away from people who smoke, actually. Bad for the health, you see. Always thought so.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, I used to have a glass of wine with dinner now and then. A little bit of sherry, perhaps. But I haven't really been drinking much lately. Not for years, actually. It doesn't agree with me, I find. Makes me feel a bit sluggish. So, I mostly stick to tea. Just a habit, I suppose. Not much of a drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, before we proceed with the physical examination, is there anything else you'd like to share with me?
PATIENT: Hmm… anything else? Let me think… No, I think that’s about it. I’m getting a bit tired, to be honest. All these questions… it’s a bit much for an old man. I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. Get back to work, you see. The show must go on, as they say. I just hope I'm not holding you up.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Krahn. We are almost finished with the initial questions. And I understand being tired; it's perfectly natural. We’ll keep things as efficient as possible. Let’s proceed with the physical exam. Would you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it's all part of the process. Heart and lungs… blood pressure… yes, yes. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I have a matinee to get to, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We’ll monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll note it. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear as well, some mild age-related changes, but nothing concerning. Everything appears generally within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? Oh dear. What does that mean? Is something wrong? I just want to make sure I can still… do my job. Ushering, you see. It's not strenuous work, but… the patrons expect to be shown to their seats. Will I need… tests? Injections? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, Mr. Krahn. Further investigation simply means we need to gather a bit more information to get a clearer picture of your overall health. In your case, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to check your general health and kidney function. We'll also do an EKG, which is a painless test that measures your heart's electrical activity. It will help us evaluate the murmur I detected. As for injections, no, we won't need any injections at this time. These tests are routine and will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. It's just a precautionary measure. The EKG and blood work will help us to determine if we need to consult with a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear, oh dear. That sounds… serious. I just want to get a note saying I'm fit to work, that's all. Is that too much to ask? I don't want to cause any trouble. The theatre manager sent me here, and I don't want to get him worried. He's a good man, but… easily flustered. Can't you just… write something down? Say I'm fine? I can take it easy, I promise. I won't lift anything heavy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we’re taking a cautious approach to ensure your well-being. While I appreciate your desire for a quick note, it would be unethical and irresponsible of me to provide a clearance without gathering the necessary information. The elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur, while potentially benign, require further investigation to rule out any underlying issues. Providing a clearance without proper assessment could put your health at risk. The tests are relatively simple and quick. It's better to be safe and have a clear understanding of your health status. I will personally review the results and discuss them with you in detail. If everything is normal, I will gladly provide the clearance you need. However, if further evaluation is necessary, we can discuss it together and determine the best course of action. Would you like me to explain the process for the blood tests and EKG in more detail?
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, I suppose you're right. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I just… I don't like doctors. Never have. Too many… poking and prodding. But if you think it's necessary… I'll do it. Blood tests and… EKG, you said? Can you at least tell me where to go? And how long it will take? I have a matinee to get to, you know. And I really don't want to cause any trouble for the theatre manager. He’s already stressed about the new lighting system.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your reluctance, and I assure you, we will make the process as comfortable as possible. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They can draw the blood samples, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG will be performed by the technician in room 205, and that will take another 10-15 minutes. In total, you should be done within 45 minutes to an hour. I’ll have the results sent to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. Here’s the information. Please let the technicians know that I ordered the tests for Brando Krahn. Once you’re finished, you can come back to my office, and we can discuss the results. I’ll also prepare a note for your theatre manager outlining the tests that were performed and the reason for them. Do you have any questions before you head over?
