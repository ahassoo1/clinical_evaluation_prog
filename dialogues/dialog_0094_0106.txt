DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Gegan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about my foot. It’s been giving me trouble for… oh, a good while now. It’s a sore, a nasty sore. And frankly, I expect you to do something about it. I’ve had diabetes for years, you know. It’s not something new.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see in your record you’ve been managing diabetes for some time. That's important information. A sore on your foot, especially with diabetes, is something we want to address carefully. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… it's on the bottom of my foot, towards the heel. It just started as a little bit of redness, you see. I thought it was a blister, maybe from my shoes. But it didn’t go away. And now… well, now it’s a hole. It's been leaking, and it's quite painful when I walk. I try to stay off of it, but… you know how it is when you’re older. Everything hurts anyway. It’s just… bothersome. Very bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on the bottom of your heel, started as redness and has progressed to an open wound that's leaking and causing pain with walking. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned it's been this way for a while. Approximately how long would you say?
PATIENT: Let me see… it must be… oh, at least three months now. Maybe four. It started right around the time my nephew, Jimmy, came to visit. Yes, that’s right. He stayed for a week, and I remember noticing it the day he left. Such a nice boy, but always tracking dirt in. But that’s beside the point. The sore, you see. It’s been three, maybe four months. And it doesn't seem to be getting better.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. Thank you. That's important to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, it hurts, obviously. And it’s… smelly. Not a pleasant odor, I assure you. And sometimes, when I’m trying to sleep, I get a little… shaky. Not all the time, just sometimes. And my leg… it feels a little warm around it, you know? But that could just be the heat. It’s terribly hot these days. Really, Doctor, are you sure you’re a doctor? You're asking me the most basic things.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem basic, Louine. It's important for me to get a complete picture, and everyone experiences symptoms differently. You're right to tell me everything, even if it seems obvious to you. So, to recap, you've experienced pain, an unpleasant odor from the sore, and occasional shakiness and warmth in your leg. Have you noticed any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Goodness, no. I haven't been sick, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable. My old bones ache, that’s all. I’m eighty-nine years old, you expect me to feel like a spring chicken? This whole experience is rather… frustrating, actually. I came here for someone to fix my foot, not to be interrogated about whether I have a cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Louine. I apologize if it feels like an interrogation. My goal is to ensure we address the sore properly, and your history helps me do that. Now, regarding your diabetes, how well controlled has it been recently?
PATIENT: Controlled? As well as can be expected for someone my age! I take my pills, you know. Every morning. And I try to watch what I eat, although a little treat now and then never hurt anyone. I haven't had my blood sugar tested in… well, it’s been a while. My son used to take me, but he moved away, you see. And frankly, I haven't gotten around to making a new appointment. It's not that I enjoy being poked and prodded, Doctor. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to become more difficult with changes in routine, and moving can definitely disrupt those routines. It sounds like it's been some time since your blood sugar was checked. Do you know roughly when the last time was, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it must have been… before the pandemic. Yes, definitely before everything shut down. So… over two years ago, probably. My nephew Jimmy reminded me the last time I saw him. He was concerned with my health. Such a kind young man, always looking out for me. But really, Doctor, I’m here about my foot! Are we ever going to look at it? I've been sitting here answering questions for ages.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Louine. I apologize for the delay. We will look at your foot. I just wanted to gather some important information first. Now, if you’re comfortable, could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine the sore?
PATIENT: Finally. It’s about time. Honestly, the things I put up with… And be careful, Doctor. My feet are… sensitive. Very sensitive. And try not to make a mess, will you? I just had these stockings washed. It’s a nuisance, getting old, a complete nuisance. But here… go ahead. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore now. It's on the bottom of your heel, as you described. It's open and there's some redness around it. It does appear to be quite deep. And I can feel some warmth in the area. I’m also noting the skin around it is quite dry. This is concerning, Louine, and requires careful attention. It looks like this wound may have become infected. I will need to order some tests to confirm that.
PATIENT: Infected? I knew it! I told you something wasn’t right. Honestly, Doctor, you were taking forever to even look at it. So, what does this mean? Am I going to have to get an amputation? My cousin Edna had to get her leg removed, and it was a terrible ordeal. I don't want that to happen to me. Are you sure it's infected? Perhaps it's just a little… irritated. Do you have any creams or ointments? Something to make it better quickly? I’ve got a garden party next week, you know. I need to be presentable.
DOCTOR: Louine, let’s not jump to conclusions. An amputation is certainly not what we're expecting at this point. It's good that we're catching this early. The infection, if that’s what it is, appears localized at the moment. We can usually manage these infections with appropriate treatment, such as antibiotics and wound care. First, I’d like to order a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, if any. I'll also order blood tests to check for signs of a wider infection. We’ll need to get your blood sugar under control, as that can significantly impact healing. I'd like to see your primary care physician regarding that, and I can send them a summary of our findings today. For now, I’m going to gently clean the wound and apply a special dressing. I will also prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics. I’ll show you how to care for the wound at home. We’ll need to see you back in a few days to check on your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, blood tests… it’s all so much. A garden party, Doctor! Do you have any idea how important this is? My best friend Millicent is flying in. Still, I suppose it's better than losing my leg. Alright. Blood tests and antibiotics. And wound care… what does that involve, exactly? Don't tell me I have to soak it in anything unpleasant. And can you write the prescription for a stronger antibiotic, just in case? And send all of this to my doctor, you said? Make sure they understand the importance of this garden party! Honestly, the things I go through...
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. I’ll prescribe an antibiotic that should be effective against common skin infections. As for wound care, it's quite straightforward. We’ll start with gentle cleaning with mild soap and water once a day. Then, you'll apply a special dressing to keep it protected and moist. I will give you detailed instructions and a demonstration before you leave. I will also send a comprehensive summary of our findings, including your medication list, the importance of blood sugar control, and a request for them to follow up with you on that, to your primary care physician right away. I will make sure to highlight your concerns about the garden party, as well. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
