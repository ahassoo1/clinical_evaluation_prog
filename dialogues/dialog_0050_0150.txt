DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, frankly, I don't have time for this, Doctor. But my… situation is this. I want to be pregnant. And I want it to be… easy. No problems. I’m 51, and I’d like to avoid any… complications that come with being, shall we say, mature. Is that a good enough explanation? I expect you to be able to make it happen.
DOCTOR: "Easy," is rarely a term one associates with pregnancy, Ms. Shteynberg, regardless of age. However, I understand your desire for a straightforward path. To assess the feasibility and safety of pursuing pregnancy at your age, we will need to gather a comprehensive medical history and perform some preliminary examinations. First, let’s discuss your medical background. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Do I look like someone who hasn’t had a check-up before? Yes, I’ve been pregnant. Once. A very long time ago. It was… fine. Perfectly normal. A son. He’s… grown now. Divorced, actually. Doesn't want anything to do with me, but that's another story. Is that what you need to know? The details of my failed marriage? Because honestly, I don't see what that has to do with anything. Let's just say it was… uncomplicated. The pregnancy, not the marriage.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… directness, Ms. Shteynberg, a full medical history is essential, even if the previous pregnancy was “uncomplicated.” Details matter. However, we can move on. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I am perfectly healthy. I exercise – I repair bicycles, doesn’t that tell you something? – and I eat… reasonably. Look, I’m not some frail old woman, Doctor. I can assure you, my body is… functional. I take vitamins. Is that good enough? And I have Medicare, if that’s what you’re worried about. I expect it to cover everything.
DOCTOR: Medicare coverage is noted, thank you. And while bicycle repair is commendable exercise, it doesn’t preclude the need for a thorough assessment. Let’s discuss medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A little ibuprofen now and then for my hands, from the… work. And a multivitamin, as I said. Nothing else. Honestly, you’re treating me like I’m… decrepit. I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of remembering what I put in my body. It's not as if I have a drawer full of pills, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. It is simply standard procedure to ascertain all medications, even those taken infrequently. Now, regarding allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Dust. I’m allergic to dust, obviously. I work with bicycles. And… cats. I loathe cats. Is that what you need? A comprehensive list of things I dislike? Look, I haven’t had a serious allergic reaction since I was a child. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just trying to waste my time? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Noted – dust and cats. While not life-threatening, allergies can sometimes complicate matters. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any genetic predispositions you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, please. My mother lived to be ninety. Ninety! Perfectly healthy until the very end. My father… heart trouble, I think. But he smoked three packs a day. Hardly relevant. And an aunt had… something. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago, and frankly, I didn’t pay much attention. We weren’t close. Is this truly necessary? I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, while your family history may seem “irrelevant” to you, it provides valuable insight. Knowing about potential predispositions allows us to proactively monitor for risks. However, I can see you are… displeased with this process. Given your age and desire for a pregnancy, a comprehensive evaluation is essential. This includes blood work to assess hormone levels, ovarian reserve, and overall health, as well as a pelvic ultrasound. Would you be amenable to proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m not a complete imbecile. I understand some of what you’re saying. But I don’t have time for endless tests. If you can’t just… make it happen, then frankly, I’ll go somewhere else. I’m paying for a service, not an interrogation. Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. And I expect results promptly. I haven’t got all day. And no lectures, please. I'm perfectly aware of the… complications that could arise. Just tell me if it's possible, or if I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I will order the necessary blood work and schedule a pelvic ultrasound for you. The lab order and appointment slip are being printed now. Please be aware that the results will take a few business days to process. I must also inform you that, given your age, the likelihood of natural conception is significantly reduced. We may need to discuss assisted reproductive technologies if the initial results are not favorable. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand perfectly. Don't patronize me. I’ve read things, Doctor. I’m not completely ignorant. Just… do the tests. And then tell me what my options are. Quickly. I need to get back to work. And please, no more talk about “likelihoods.” Just the facts, Doctor. The facts.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Shteynberg. The lab is located on the third floor, room 312. The appointment for the ultrasound is scheduled for August 9th at 10:00 AM. I will review the results with you when they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, or dizziness – please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just get it done. And please, don't waste my time with unnecessary questions. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. You may proceed. I trust you will find your way out.
PATIENT: .
