DOCTOR: Hi Edric, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s…well, my muscles feel weak. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it's getting harder to do things. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I work as an insurance appraiser – auto damage – so I need to be on my feet and moving around all day. It’s becoming difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness is definitely something we want to look into, especially with your job. “A little while now” – can you give me a rough timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I’d say, about three months ago. At first, it was just feeling tired at the end of the day, you know? But it’s gotten steadily worse. Now, I notice it even in the mornings. It’s like… lifting things feels heavier than it should, and my legs get tired quicker when I’m walking around job sites. Three months, definitely. Maybe a little longer, actually. It's hard to pinpoint exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months or so. And is this weakness all over, or is it more in certain areas?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my legs and arms, I think. My arms get tired when I’m writing up reports, and my legs… well, like I said, walking around a wrecked car feels like climbing a hill now. It’s not painful, exactly, just… heavy and weak. My back feels a bit stiff sometimes too, but I'm not sure if that’s connected, honestly. I haven’t noticed it anywhere else, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, legs and arms mostly, some stiffness in your back. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I’ve been sleeping alright, I guess. Maybe a little more than usual, but I figured that was just because I’m tired from the weakness. No fever, no… dizziness, nothing like that. I haven’t lost any weight, and my appetite is normal. I'm trying to think if anything else is different, but not really, no. It’s just the weakness, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other symptoms are helpful to know. Now, just to get a better picture, have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold or the flu – before this started or while it's been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. I had a pretty bad cold back in February, around the same time things started feeling a bit off, actually. It knocked me around for a good week, but I recovered. Nothing else, though. No flu shots, either, if that matters. Just the regular cold. It felt like a normal cold, nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cold in February. And have you had any injuries – like a pulled muscle or anything like that – that might have contributed to this?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm pretty careful, actually. Being an appraiser, you gotta be, you know? Lots of walking around broken glass and twisted metal. I haven’t fallen or twisted anything. No injuries that I can think of, no. I'm almost positive it didn't start with an injury. It just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent injuries. Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly, not much. I’ve been pretty healthy my whole life. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course, but that’s about it. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, no regular medications. I don't even take vitamins, really. I'm not a big fan of doctors, if I'm being honest. That's probably why I waited so long to come in. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and perfectly alright. It’s good you’re here now. No significant medical history is helpful. Okay, and what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My father had high blood pressure, but that was later in life. My mother… she had arthritis in her hands, but that’s pretty common, I think. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that on either side of the family, as far as I know. My parents are both… well, they’ve passed away now, so it’s hard to be totally sure. But I don’t remember anyone having muscle weakness or anything similar.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of muscle weakness. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, no reactions to bee stings or anything like that. And like I said, I don’t take any medications, so I haven’t had any bad reactions to those either. Clean bill of health on that front, I guess. Sorry to be so…long-winded. I don't usually talk this much.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, you’re doing great. It’s good to get a complete picture. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Just a few things to check your strength and reflexes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm ready when you are. Just want to figure out what's going on, like we said. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’d like you to sit on the exam table and I’ll check your reflexes. After that, we’ll do a little strength testing. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, can you just let your arms relax by your side?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relaxed. Like this? I’m a little nervous, so hopefully, that doesn't mess anything up. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, a long time. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. A little nervousness is normal. Okay, your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as hard as you can. Just when I say “stop”, let go. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Squeeze as hard as I can. Like this? I'm trying to squeeze pretty hard, Doctor. Just let me know when to stop.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That’s good strength. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hands with your feet while you’re lying on the table. I’m going to start with your right leg. Just push as hard as you can. I’ll hold my hands still and just give me resistance. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Push with my right leg. Like this? I'm pushing as hard as I can, Doctor. Let me know if you need me to push harder or something. It's…getting a little tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s do the left leg. Push against my hands with your left leg. Okay. Your strength is 4+ in all extremities, slightly reduced in the legs, but not significantly. Reflexes are normal. Overall, there is mild weakness in your legs, but no other concerning neurological findings on initial exam. Given your history and the exam findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause immediately. A few possibilities come to mind. We could consider vitamin deficiencies, particularly Vitamin D, or it could be related to the cold you had earlier this year. Sometimes viral infections can cause temporary muscle weakness. It could also be something musculoskeletal, though you haven’t reported any specific injuries. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, Vitamin D level, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood tests, whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Vitamin D… I guess I don’t get much sun, now that I think about it. Working all day, mostly indoors. So, yeah, blood tests are fine. Whatever you need. When can I get those done? And how long will it take to get the results? Hopefully, it’s not anything too serious. I really need to get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can get those tests done right here at the clinic. The phlebotomist is available now, if you’re ready. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically come back in 3-5 business days. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d also recommend trying to get a little more sun exposure if possible, even just 15-20 minutes a day. And I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief as needed, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, for any muscle soreness. Given your lack of insurance, the cost of the tests will be approximately $150. We do have a payment plan available if that’s helpful. And if you don’t see any improvement within a week, or if your symptoms worsen, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests, the payment plan, or anything else?
PATIENT: $150… okay, I can manage that. A payment plan would be helpful, actually, thank you. I appreciate that. No, I think I’m good for now. Blood tests, payment plan, see if it’s a Vitamin D thing… and try to get more sun. Okay. Where do I go to get the blood drawn? And will I need to make another appointment after the results come back? I really hope it's not something major. I have bills to pay, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The phlebotomist’s office is just down the hall, room 3. Just tell them Dr. Amussen sent you for the blood tests. They’ll get you all set up. Yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today to discuss the results. You can do that at the front desk on your way out. That way, we can review the findings and determine the best course of action. And don't worry too much. We’re going to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully, it’s something simple. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Room 3, follow-up appointment… got it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for the payment plan. I really do. Hopefully, it’s just a Vitamin D thing. Alright, I’ll go find room 3. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
