DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chakka. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…rather bothersome, actually. I’ve been feeling quite tired lately, despite getting adequate rest, and I seem to be losing weight without any…intentional effort on my part. Additionally, I’ve been experiencing excessive sweating at night, which is most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Adequate rest, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Approximately seven to eight hours nightly. It's not as though I am deliberately depriving myself of sleep, Doctor. I find it…disrespectful to imply otherwise. I maintain a very structured schedule.
DOCTOR: Structured, hmm. And when did you first start noticing this fatigue and weight loss?
PATIENT: It began…approximately three months ago, I believe. Perhaps late April? I recall it coinciding with the start of the monsoon season, though I doubt that is of any clinical significance. It was gradual at first, but it has become increasingly noticeable in recent weeks. The night sweats are…more recent, perhaps a month or so.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. My dietary habits are…quite refined. My husband prepares all meals, and he adheres to a very strict regimen of traditional Nepalese cuisine. It's a balanced diet, rich in… wholesome ingredients. We have not deviated from it. I find your inquiry somewhat…presumptuous, Doctor. Are you suggesting I am not mindful of what I consume?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Chakka, I wasn't implying that. I simply need a complete picture. Let’s move on. Do you have any fevers, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I do not “do” illnesses. I maintain a very high standard of personal hygiene and rarely associate with those who are unwell. A fever would be…most inconvenient, and frankly, unacceptable. I have experienced no chills, nor any respiratory complaints. My breathing is perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Doctor, I find this line of questioning…impertinent. While I understand you are attempting to gather information, I believe some details are unnecessarily…personal. My bodily functions are functioning perfectly adequately, thank you very much. I assure you, there have been no significant deviations from the norm. Must we delve into such…graphic specifics?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chakka, these questions are necessary to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. It's standard medical practice. However, if you are truly uncomfortable discussing this, we can proceed, but it may limit my ability to provide an accurate assessment. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, I do not suffer pain. Occasionally, I experience a slight discomfort in my lower back after gardening, but that is merely a muscle strain, easily remedied with a warm compress. I do not believe that is relevant. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. Are we any closer to a diagnosis, or will you continue to interrogate me about…trivial matters?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. My family has a long and…distinguished history of good health. My father lived to be ninety-seven, and my mother is currently eighty-five and remarkably spry. I maintain a vigorous exercise routine and prioritize healthy living. I assure you, chronic illness is…entirely foreign to my lineage. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that is of any significance.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospitalizations. I have a very high pain tolerance and pride myself on avoiding unnecessary medical intervention. A minor tonsillectomy as a child, perhaps, but that was decades ago and hardly warrants mention. I consider myself remarkably resilient. Are we approaching the end of this…assessment, Doctor? I have a luncheon engagement shortly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My family history, as I mentioned, is impeccable. No instances of cancer, heart disease, or any debilitating illness. My maternal grandmother had mild arthritis in her later years, but she lived a full and active life despite it. My husband's family is equally healthy; generations of strong farmers and resilient individuals. Frankly, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of endlessly reiterating my family’s good fortune. Are you seeking any specific ailments, or are we simply compiling a list of non-existent medical problems?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chakka, I understand your frustration. However, it is essential for me to gather a thorough history. Now, let’s discuss your social habits. Do you smoke or consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! The very notion is…repulsive. Smoking is a barbaric practice, and alcohol impairs judgment and degrades one’s constitution. I maintain a very strict lifestyle, focused on health and well-being. My husband occasionally enjoys a small glass of rakshi during festivals, but I do not partake. I find your inquiries increasingly…unprofessional, Doctor. Is this standard practice when evaluating a patient presenting with legitimate concerns?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining a natural and holistic approach to health. I do not believe in relying on artificial substances to remedy ailments. A daily multivitamin is merely a preventative measure, a supplement to my already healthy diet. I occasionally consume ginger tea for digestive ailments, but that is a traditional remedy, not a medication. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning…demeaning. Are you implying I am neglecting my health, when quite the opposite is true?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chakka, with all due respect, I am trying to understand what may be causing your symptoms. Now, let's proceed to a brief physical exam, if you'll permit me. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Perhaps that will provide some insight.
PATIENT: Palpate my abdomen? Doctor, I believe this examination is…unnecessary. I assure you, my internal organs are functioning perfectly. However, if you insist, I suppose I can tolerate a brief auscultation of my heart and lungs. But I will not consent to any invasive procedures or prolonged physical contact. And please, be gentle. I have sensitive skin. And do wash your hands thoroughly beforehand, if you will. Hygiene, Doctor, is paramount.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. Your heart rate is…slightly elevated. Lungs sound clear, but a little fast breathing. Palpating your abdomen now. Do you experience any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Elevated? That is…most peculiar. Perhaps I was simply anxious due to the…unpleasantness of this examination. I do not detect any tenderness, Doctor. Though I must admit, your touch is rather…cold. And I feel slightly…exposed. This entire experience is deeply unsettling. Is there anything you have discovered of significance, or are we merely engaging in pointless physical probing? I do have a luncheon engagement, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – fatigue, weight loss, night sweats – and the slightly elevated heart rate, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your iron levels. This will help us rule out a number of possibilities. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? Doctor, are you suggesting I have a serious ailment? I assure you, I am in perfectly good health. However, if it will expedite this…ordeal and allow me to return to my scheduled activities, I suppose I can consent to your…probes. But I expect a prompt and thorough explanation of the results, and I will not tolerate any unnecessary alarm. And please, ensure the laboratory technician is proficient and utilizes sterile equipment. I have…standards, you understand. Is there anything else you require of me? I trust this concludes the physical portion of the examination?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chakka, this concludes the physical exam for now. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk. They will schedule you for an appointment. I'll also send a referral to a hematologist as a precaution, given your symptoms. It's best to rule everything out. And I will, of course, review the results with you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, unexplained bruising, or significant bleeding – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A hematologist? Doctor, this is becoming…increasingly concerning. Are you suggesting I have a blood disorder? This is simply unacceptable. However, if it will provide me with peace of mind, I suppose I can consult with your…specialist. But I expect a swift and conclusive diagnosis. And please, assure me this is merely a precautionary measure and not an indication of a grave illness. This is…most distressing. As for questions, I do have one. How long will I have to wait for these…results? And will the hematologist require a lengthy examination? I have a very busy schedule, you understand. This entire experience is…most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chakka, I understand your anxiety. A referral doesn't mean you have a serious condition. It simply allows us to investigate your symptoms thoroughly and rule out any potential causes. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. The hematologist will likely want to repeat some of the blood work and may perform a physical exam, but it shouldn't be lengthy. I'm ordering these tests as a precaution, to ensure we’re being as thorough as possible. We'll discuss the results in detail once they’re available, and I’ll explain all your options. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Address? No, I believe that concludes our…discussion. Though I must express my profound dissatisfaction with this entire experience. It has been…disruptive, unpleasant, and frankly, rather alarming. I trust you will provide me with a prompt and conclusive diagnosis, and that these…tests will not reveal any serious ailments. I have a luncheon engagement to attend, you understand, and I require my energy. I shall await your…assessment with a mixture of apprehension and…irritation. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chakka. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule your appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. And…have a good day. .
