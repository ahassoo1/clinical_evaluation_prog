DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise – a rather nice one, actually – and the cruise line needs some information from a doctor. Just a standard thing, I believe. They sent a form.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A pre-cruise medical questionnaire is quite common. They want to ensure we've addressed any potential health concerns before your voyage. I see. To begin, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I mean, I’m not as young as I once was, of course. Forty-five years old. But no major illnesses, if that’s what you mean. I do get a bit of…well, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Nothing I can’t manage. I lost my husband a few years back, and that was…difficult. But that’s more emotional than physical, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. Losing a loved one is profoundly difficult, and it certainly can impact one’s well-being. Thank you for sharing that with me. To clarify, when you say “usual aches and pains,” could you tell me where you experience these and how frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Mostly in my lower back, Doctor. It flares up if I’ve been on my feet all day, which happens a bit with my job – I arrange displays in shops, you see. Window trimming and such. It's not constant, thankfully. Perhaps two or three times a month it gets bad enough to bother me, and I need to sit down for a bit. Otherwise, just a general stiffness, really. And sometimes my knees ache, especially if the weather is changing. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful indeed, Ms. Squiers. So, lower back pain, exacerbated by prolonged standing, occurring two to three times monthly, and occasional knee pain related to weather changes. Do you notice anything specific that relieves this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. A warm bath usually does the trick, Doctor. And a good sit down, naturally. I also find that if I move about a bit, gently, it eases up after a while. Nothing drastic, mind you. Just a bit of stretching, really. And I take paracetamol sometimes, if it’s particularly bad. Just over-the-counter stuff, nothing prescribed. It usually does the job.
DOCTOR: Very good. Warm baths, gentle movement, and over-the-counter paracetamol for relief. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms – the lower back and knee discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been a while now. I’d say… probably the last five years or so, on and off. It started gradually, just a little niggle here and there. It’s never been anything debilitating, thankfully. It just… comes and goes. It’s more annoying than anything else, to be honest. I mostly ignore it unless it gets really bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand. Five years of intermittent lower back and knee discomfort. Now, Ms. Squiers, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about other areas of your health. Have you experienced any other medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've never been diagnosed with anything, thankfully. I get a yearly check-up with my GP, just to be on the safe side, and he always says I’m as right as rain. Blood pressure is always normal, and I don't have any problems with my heart. I do wear glasses, of course, as you can see, but that's the only thing. I'm quite a healthy eater, too – lots of fruit and vegetables. I try to stay active, despite my job being a bit physical at times.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Squiers. It sounds like you take good care of yourself. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I've been very fortunate, I suppose. No broken bones, no operations, nothing like that. I’ve always been quite careful, and I haven’t had any serious accidents, thankfully. I did have my tonsils out when I was a child, but that was a very long time ago, and it wasn’t particularly complicated, as far as I remember. My mother did most of the worrying about that, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a bit of a tricky one, Doctor. My mother lived to a good age – eighty-nine, I think – but she did have arthritis in her hands, quite badly towards the end. And my father… he had a heart attack when he was in his sixties, sadly. That was a shock to us all. My brother is fit and healthy, as far as I know, but we don't see each other very often these days. He lives down south. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. History of arthritis in your mother and a heart attack in your father. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, other than the paracetamol you mentioned for pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the paracetamol when I need it. Nothing regular. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to get everything I need from my food, if I can. I'm not a fan of taking pills unless I absolutely have to, to be honest. I think a good diet and a bit of exercise are much better for you in the long run.
DOCTOR: Very good. So, no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, Ms. Squiers, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I do get a bit cold easily, mind you, so perhaps a blanket might be nice?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely provide a blanket. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll examine your back and knees. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Just take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything. I’m quite relaxed, so you needn’t worry about rushing. It’s good to be thorough, I always say. And thank you for being so patient with me. It’s nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I believe a thorough assessment is important. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. And your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you would please take a deep breath for me, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright. There you go. I hope I’m not making too much noise breathing! I do tend to breathe a bit heavily sometimes, especially if I’ve been doing a lot of walking. It's probably just my age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are normal – regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or extra sounds detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you could please lie on your back on the examination table, I would like to examine your lower back. I'll gently palpate along your spine and assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. There you go. Just let me know if I need to move or adjust in any way. I do get a bit of a twinge in my back sometimes if I move too quickly, so please be gentle. And thank you again for being so considerate. It’s very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Squiers, I'm palpating your spine now. Do you experience any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just a little there. That's about the spot where it usually bothers me. Not excruciating, but definitely a niggle. It's more of a dull ache, really. It's been like that for a while now, on and off, as I said. Is that what you expected?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s consistent with what you’ve described. There’s some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, specifically at the L4-L5 level. Your range of motion is slightly limited with forward flexion, and there’s mild discomfort with extension. Now, let’s examine your knees. Could you please bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Alright. There you go. It’s a bit stiff, to be honest, especially first thing in the morning. And sometimes it cracks a bit, which doesn't hurt, but it’s a bit unsettling. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, some crepitus – that’s the cracking sound – is quite common, especially with age and normal wear and tear. There’s no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation. Your range of motion is full, although you do report some stiffness. Alright, Ms. Squiers, I’ve completed the physical examination.
PATIENT: Good. Well, that wasn’t too bad at all, was it? What do you think, Doctor? Is it anything serious? I’m not particularly worried, to be honest, but I just wanted to get it checked out before I go on my cruise. I wouldn’t want anything to spoil my holiday.
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the physical examination, it appears you have mild lower back pain and some stiffness in your knees, likely due to age-related wear and tear and possibly some mild osteoarthritis. There are no signs of anything more serious. It is very unlikely that this will impact your cruise. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other underlying conditions, I recommend a simple X-ray of your lower back and knees. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An X-ray, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt, would it? I'm not terribly keen on radiation, if I'm honest, but if you think it's best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I just want to be on the safe side, as you know. And I don’t want to be worrying about it while I'm away. So, yes, alright. Let’s go ahead with the X-rays. Is it something we can do here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly do the X-rays here at the clinic. It’s a quick and painless procedure. The amount of radiation is minimal. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend continuing with the over-the-counter paracetamol as needed for pain relief. I also suggest gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, such as walking or swimming, to help maintain your flexibility and strength. While the radiologist reviews the images, I will also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and recommendations. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Gentle stretching and walking – I can certainly manage that. And a written summary would be very helpful, thank you. I like to keep track of things, you see. It’s good to have everything in writing. You’ve put my mind at ease, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and examine me so thoroughly. I feel much more confident now about going on my cruise.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. I will have the nurse take you to the radiology department to get the X-rays done. Once they are completed, we can review the results together and discuss a more specific treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, numbness, or weakness, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. And thank you again for your reassurance. I’m looking forward to my cruise now, without worrying quite so much. Please just let me know when the nurse is ready for me, and I’ll go and get the X-rays done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will inform the nurse immediately. She will be with you shortly, Ms. Squiers. Enjoy your cruise, and please have a wonderful time. If you need anything at all, don't hesitate to reach out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I certainly will. Goodbye!
