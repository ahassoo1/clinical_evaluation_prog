DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally, for a few months now. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s becoming quite noticeable, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Weakness and drooping eyelids – that’s certainly something we should investigate. “Weakness generally” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to narrow it down. Could you describe the weakness a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… it's not like a sudden thing, more like it takes more effort to do things. Like, carrying groceries upstairs is harder than it used to be. And even holding my head up for long periods feels… straining. It’s mostly in my arms and legs, I think, but sometimes it feels like it’s everywhere, if that makes sense? It’s… hard to pinpoint exactly.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Gradual onset is important information. And it’s helpful to know it affects your arms and legs primarily, but can be more widespread. When you say "straining," are you experiencing any actual pain with these activities, or is it more of a fatigue or heaviness?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. It’s more… heaviness, yes. Like I'm fighting against something. And the fatigue comes on quicker than it used to. I used to be able to work in the garden all afternoon, no problem. Now, an hour and I'm completely wiped out. It’s… unsettling. I don’t understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Let’s move on to those eyelids, then. When did you first notice them drooping?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe three or four months ago? I thought it was just tiredness at first, working long hours. But it hasn’t gone away. And it seems to be getting worse, especially in the evenings. My wife – my ex-wife, I should say – she pointed it out, actually. She said I looked… tired. More tired than usual. Which… wasn’t a compliment, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, progressive, noticed by others. That’s helpful. Does the drooping happen with certain activities, like when you're concentrating or reading, or is it consistent throughout the day?
PATIENT: It seems… worse when I’m tired, naturally. And if I’m looking down for a long time, like when I’m reading or doing paperwork. I work with a lot of documents, so that’s… frequent. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely noticeable when I’m focused on something for a while. It’s… it’s making it hard to see properly sometimes, which is a bit worrying when you’re trying to be precise with your work.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any double vision or blurry vision at all, besides what you’re noticing with the drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision feels strained, like I said, but not blurry or doubled. Just… tired. It's difficult to explain. It’s almost like my eyes are heavy, and it takes effort to keep them open, even when I’m not tired. I’ve tried getting more sleep, but it doesn’t seem to make a huge difference. It's… frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schaust. Alright, let's switch gears a bit. To get a better picture of what might be going on, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I haven’t really had to see a doctor much over the years. My ex-wife always handled those things, usually. She was very… organized. It’s… difficult remembering everything now. Is it okay if I pause if I need to think?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schaust. Take your time. It's perfectly alright to pause and think. No need to rush. We'll get through this together. So, no prior medical diagnoses?
PATIENT: No, none that I recall. Nothing diagnosed, at least. I did have a bout of… a really bad flu a few years ago, maybe five years? I was bedridden for a week, but I recovered completely. And I broke my arm when I was a child, playing football, but that healed well too. Otherwise… I'm afraid that's about it. It’s a fairly uneventful medical history, I suppose. I hope that’s not… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Schaust. A childhood broken arm and a bout of the flu don't seem to be related, but it's good to have the information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve… avoided hospitals whenever possible, to be honest. I don’t have a good relationship with them. My ex-wife… she would schedule yearly check-ups for everything, but I always tried to reschedule. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. It’s… irrational, I know. But I’ve never had any reason to be in a hospital, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, perfectly alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep, but as you know, that hasn’t been working particularly well lately. I used to take a multivitamin occasionally, but I stopped a long time ago. I… I’m not much of a supplement person, if that makes sense. Just… prefer to let my body do its own thing.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No current medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My ex-wife always checked everything very carefully when we traveled, but I’ve never had any issues with allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. She… she was very cautious about that, too. It’s… difficult not to compare everything to how she would have handled it, I suppose. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Mr. Schaust. It's perfectly alright to share what you're thinking. And no allergies is good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, but it wasn’t too severe. I don’t recall anything else particularly significant. My grandparents… they lived fairly long lives, but I didn’t know them very well. My ex-wife… she always asked about family history, of course, but I never paid much attention. It’s… not something I’ve ever really thought about much. Sorry, I'm probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schaust. You're providing what you know, and that's what matters. High blood pressure and arthritis are good to note. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I work as a facilities manager, so I’m on my feet a fair bit. Mostly office work, but I have to go around checking different buildings sometimes. I used to go to the gym regularly, but I haven’t been in months. I… things have been a bit difficult lately, as you can probably tell. I don’t drink or smoke. I live alone now, so I mostly cook for myself. Simple meals, nothing fancy. And… I sleep… when I can. It’s… not a very exciting lifestyle, to be honest. But it’s my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. Facilities manager, on your feet, used to go to the gym, no smoking or alcohol. Thank you. Now, finally, a bit of a sensitive question. Are there any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Yes… there are. My divorce… it was finalized about six months ago. It's… difficult. My ex-wife and I… we're not on very good terms. And I’m… still adjusting to being on my own. It’s… isolating, to be honest. I don’t have much family nearby, and I’ve lost touch with a lot of my friends. It's… it’s been a lot to deal with. I’m… trying to be positive, but it’s difficult, as you can imagine. I suppose that explains why I’m not sleeping very well. It’s… a bit embarrassing to admit, but it’s the truth.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all, Mr. Schaust. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that it’s been affecting your sleep and overall well-being. Thank you for sharing that with me. Alright, now I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will help me to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly acceptable. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. I’m… rather worried about it, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I apologize if my pulse is a little fast… I get a bit nervous at doctors’ offices. It’s… an irrational fear, I suppose. But I can’t help it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schaust. It's very common to feel a little anxious during a medical exam. Your blood pressure is 135/85, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Slightly elevated, but understandable given your anxiety. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, with no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer… This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Look left… look right… look up… look down… Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Alright, that completes the brief physical exam. Overall, there are no significant abnormalities detected, but your slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse are something to keep an eye on. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The drooping eyelids, along with the weakness, could be indicative of a neuromuscular issue such as myasthenia gravis. However, it’s also possible that these symptoms are related to stress and fatigue. To rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a test for acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which can help to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… sounds sensible. Blood tests… if that’s what you think is necessary, then please, go ahead. Myasthenia gravis… that sounds… rather serious. I’ve never heard of it before. Is it… treatable? And… what does it mean if the tests are positive? I suppose I should probably prepare myself for the worst, shouldn’t I? I… I just want to know what’s going on, and what I can do about it. I’m… rather frightened, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be frightened, Mr. Schaust. Myasthenia gravis can be a serious condition, but it is treatable. The good news is that with proper management, most people with myasthenia gravis can live full and productive lives. The treatment typically involves medications to suppress the immune system and improve muscle function. If the tests come back positive, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a severe case. We’ll need to further evaluate the severity of your symptoms and develop a personalized treatment plan. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the results. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle adjustments to help manage your symptoms. Getting enough rest is crucial. Aim for at least eight hours of sleep each night. Try to reduce stress as much as possible, and consider talking to a therapist or counselor to help you cope with your divorce. Eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated are also important. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist, who is a specialist in neuromuscular disorders. They can perform further testing and provide expert guidance. I’m going to order the blood tests now, and the results should be back in about a week. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. A neurologist… eight hours of sleep… I’ll try my best. It’s… a lot to take in. Thank you for… being so patient with me. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. I was… rather worried they were all in my head. One small question, if you don’t mind. What… what does it feel like if it is myasthenia gravis? What should I be looking out for? Besides… difficulty breathing, which you already mentioned. I just… I want to be prepared. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Schaust. It’s good you’re asking. The symptoms of myasthenia gravis can vary quite a bit from person to person, but the hallmark symptom is muscle weakness that worsens with activity and improves with rest. It often affects the muscles that control eye movement, causing drooping eyelids, double vision, or blurred vision. It can also affect the muscles that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking, leading to difficulty with these activities. Some people experience weakness in their arms and legs, making it difficult to walk or climb stairs. The weakness tends to fluctuate throughout the day, being worse in the evening or after prolonged activity. It’s important to note that not everyone experiences all of these symptoms, and the severity of the symptoms can vary greatly. If you notice any new or worsening muscle weakness, especially if it’s associated with activity and improves with rest, please let me know immediately. I’m going to give you a written handout with more information about myasthenia gravis, including a list of symptoms to watch out for. I also want you to keep a symptom diary, where you can track your symptoms and note any triggers or patterns. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's… all. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and your patience. I'll try to remain calm and monitor my symptoms. And I'll keep the symptom diary. I suppose I'll be going now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schaust, you can go now. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the blood test results are back. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself, and remember to prioritize rest and stress reduction. I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
