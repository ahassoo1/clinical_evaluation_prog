DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even with the machine… the one I use at night for the… sleep apnea, you see. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the trick completely. I still find myself dozing off during the day, and it’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea – that’s definitely something we need to look into. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm… well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up, thankfully. But I’ll be reading, maybe in my armchair, and before I know it, I’ve nodded off for… oh, twenty, thirty minutes sometimes. Or watching television, same thing. It happens mostly when I’m relaxing, quiet activities. It doesn't happen when I'm doing things, if that makes sense. Walking, talking with friends… that keeps me awake. It’s just… when I settle down. And I feel quite tired even before I start to nod off, if I’m honest. It’s a sluggish kind of tired.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Paske. So, it seems to be more prominent during quiet, relaxing times, and you experience a feeling of sluggishness even before the sleepiness hits. And you’ve been using the CPAP machine consistently, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, consistently. Every night. I wouldn’t skip it. My ex-wife… well, she made sure of that, initially! But even she wasn't wrong, it does make a difference in how I feel in the mornings. Just… not enough, it seems. I put it on before bed, wear it all night, take it off when I wake up. I clean it regularly, too. I’m pretty good about following the instructions.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’re consistent with the CPAP and diligent about cleaning it. It’s important. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your typical day?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, I’m retired now, you see. Used to be a professor – Ethnic Studies, at the university. Very interesting work. Now, I mostly keep busy with reading – history, mostly, biographies – and I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. I help with shelving and sometimes assist people with research. I have lunch with friends most days, usually. And I try to walk for about half an hour, if the weather’s good. Not much strenuous activity, mind you, but I like to stay moving. Bedtime is usually around ten, maybe a little later if I’m reading a particularly good book. Oh, and I take a short nap after lunch sometimes, but it's usually only twenty minutes or so, if that.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling retirement, Mr. Paske. It's good you're staying active both mentally and physically. And the short nap after lunch – is that something you need to do to get through the day, or more of a pleasant habit?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It’s… becoming more of a need, I think. A few years ago, it was just a nice thing to do if I had the time. Now, if I don’t take it, I find myself feeling… well, that sluggishness creeping in again by mid-afternoon. It’s not a long nap, and I try to keep it short, but it definitely helps. Without it, I’m much more likely to doze off in my armchair later on. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So the nap is becoming increasingly important to manage the daytime fatigue. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of – things like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, that was no big deal. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s manageable with over-the-counter pain relief. Oh, and I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I see my primary care doctor regularly, and they monitor it. I don't have diabetes, and my heart's always been strong, thankfully. I had a stress test a couple of years ago, and everything was fine. I've been quite lucky, really, all things considered. Aside from that, nothing major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and well-controlled high blood pressure. And you see your primary care doctor regularly. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And sometimes, if my arthritis is particularly bad, I’ll take Ibuprofen, but just as needed. Not every day, mind you. And that’s it, really. Just those two. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I'm a bit old-fashioned that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily and Ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in years. I eat just about everything, and I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, too. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or sleep disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had heart disease, unfortunately. He had a heart attack in his early seventies. And my mother had type 2 diabetes, but she developed it later in life. My brother is fine, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other often. He lives out west. As for sleep disorders… not that I’m aware of. No one in my family snored particularly loudly, or ever mentioned having trouble sleeping. It’s funny you ask, because this daytime sleepiness feels… rather unique in my family. It's not something that's ever been a common issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had heart disease, your mother had type 2 diabetes, and no known history of sleep disorders in the family. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I'm divorced, have been for quite some time now. No children, unfortunately. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, if I’m feeling festive. I used to enjoy gardening, but my arthritis makes it a bit difficult these days. I live alone in a small apartment downtown, close to the library and a few restaurants. It's convenient. I enjoy reading, volunteering, and spending time with friends. Nothing too exciting, really. A quiet life, but it suits me just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, no children, non-smoker, occasional alcohol consumption, enjoys reading and volunteering. Now, Mr. Paske, it sounds like you’ve been very thorough in providing me with your medical and social history, and I appreciate that. Before we move on to the physical exam, I’d like to quickly review your CPAP machine settings. Do you know what pressure it’s set to?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, actually. My sleep doctor – Dr. Ramirez, lovely woman – she adjusted it last year. It’s set at 12 centimeters of water pressure, I believe. She said it was a good setting for my size and the results of my sleep study. I have a card with the details at home, but I remember her telling me 12. I make sure to keep it updated whenever she makes changes. It's important, you know, to have the right setting.
DOCTOR: Okay, 12 centimeters of water pressure. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Mr. Paske, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. And I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to these things, you know. I've had quite a few check-ups over the years. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs sound clear, though a bit quiet. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not dramatically so. And your oxygen saturation is good. I’m now going to gently palpate your neck to feel for any enlarged lymph nodes or abnormalities in your thyroid. I don’t feel any obvious swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reassuring. A bit quiet, you say? Is that something to worry about? I do get short of breath sometimes, when I walk uphill, but I just figured that was due to my age, you know? I’m not as young as I used to be! But it’s good to know you’re checking everything thoroughly, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: The slightly diminished lung sounds aren't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, Mr. Paske, but they do warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things – age-related changes, mild asthma, or even just positioning. The occasional shortness of breath when walking uphill is also common with age, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Now, based on your history, the physical exam, and the fact that you're still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine, I think it would be helpful to order a few tests. Would you be agreeable to a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps to figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to have those tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and… TSH, you said? Yes, go ahead. I trust your judgment. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I thought the machine was supposed to fix everything. It’s good to know you’re looking into it further.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It's disappointing when things don't go as planned. The CPAP machine is excellent for treating sleep apnea, but it doesn't address all potential causes of daytime sleepiness. The CBC will check for any underlying infection or anemia, the CMP assesses your kidney and liver function and electrolyte levels, and the TSH test checks for thyroid problems, which can cause fatigue. I’ll also want to review the data from your CPAP machine to see how consistently you’re using it and whether there are any issues with the mask seal. I'll send an order to the lab, and they’ll schedule an appointment for you to have your blood drawn. After the results come back, we’ll discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I want you to continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Continue with the machine, of course. That makes perfect sense. And the data from the machine… good idea. It's good to have all the information. You're very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate it. I feel much better knowing we're looking at all the possibilities. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I don't understand all the medical jargon, but you make it easy to follow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s important to me that my patients understand their health and feel comfortable with their treatment plan. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I’m sure I’ll think of something once I get home, but for now… I think I’m good. Just… thank you again for your time and patience. It's reassuring to know you're taking this seriously. I'll wait for the lab to contact me, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. If anything does come to mind, please don't hesitate to call the office. We’re here to support you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you after the lab results are in.
