DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about…my skin? I feel rather tired, yes, quite tired, but I’ve been working. Always working. Is that not enough of an explanation? Frankly, I haven’t much time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It’s quite alright if you’re unsure. Your wife is very thoughtful to bring you in. Just let me ask a few questions, and we’ll try to get to the bottom of things as efficiently as possible. You mentioned feeling tired…has that been a recent change, or is that something you’ve been experiencing for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Decades, probably. Since…well, since I started reinforcing iron. It's a strenuous job, you understand. Always has been. I don’t understand what more you need to know. It’s work. It makes one tired. Is that not…logical? I’ve never needed a doctor to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Perfectly logical, Mr. Drahota. I simply want to rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue. Sometimes, tiredness can be a symptom of something else entirely. Now, apart from the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my wife keeps going on about my skin. Says it’s…darker. I haven’t paid it much mind, to be honest. Old age, perhaps? Or the sun. I work outdoors, you know. Though I do use a hat… sometimes. Is that what this is about? This…skin business? I'd rather not discuss it further, frankly. It's quite…unimportant.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota. It's good you mention the skin changes, though. Let's take a closer look, if you wouldn’t mind. It will only take a moment, and it can help us determine if any further investigation is needed. Just a quick examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Really? Must you poke and prod? I suppose… if it will hasten this process. But I assure you, Doctor, it's merely the sun and…the hardships of a working man's life. I've no time for unnecessary fuss. Get on with it, then. Quickly, please. I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. I’m noting some areas of hyperpigmentation, particularly on the dorsal surfaces of your hands and forearms. And the skin feels somewhat rough to the touch. Are there any areas that are particularly itchy, painful, or blistered?
PATIENT: Itchy? No. Painful? Occasionally, when I’ve been handling particularly rough rebar, naturally. Blistered… perhaps. Sometimes, from the sun. It’s hardly a matter worth mentioning. I use gloves when I can, you understand. But they get…damaged. This is all quite obvious, Doctor. Are you a medical professional or simply a…noticer of things? I fail to see the point of this detailed observation. It's work, sun, and aging. Simple. Now, can we conclude this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. However, even seemingly simple things can have underlying causes we need to rule out. While it’s certainly possible these changes are due to sun exposure and work, we should also consider other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? Good heavens, Doctor, are you interrogating me now? I eat when I'm hungry, and my weight fluctuates with the demands of the job! I lose weight in the summer heat, gain it back with the colder months. It's…basic biology! I find your line of questioning rather intrusive, and frankly, a waste of both our time. Is there something specific you’re fishing for, or are we simply cataloging the mundane realities of a working man’s life? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of recognizing my own body. Now, if you'll excuse me…
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I'm only trying to gather enough information to provide the best possible care. We're simply trying to rule out anything serious. Now, regarding your medical history… Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the slightest idea. I've never bothered with such things. When I was a young man, we didn’t have time for allergies. Work was the priority. Now…I suppose I eat everything my wife puts in front of me. She's a good cook. No…no allergies that I am aware of. This is all rather ridiculous, you know. I feel perfectly fine, aside from the usual aches and fatigue. Can we simply agree that it's work and aging and be done with this? I have a delivery to oversee this afternoon. And a schedule, as I’ve already mentioned. It’s a rather important schedule. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. I do want to quickly assess your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs, if you'll permit. It’s a standard part of any medical evaluation. It will only take a few moments. After that, we can discuss a plan, and if necessary, a referral to a specialist. Would that be acceptable?
