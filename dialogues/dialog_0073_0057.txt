DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone. It's been a little hard to understand everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say. Yes, I see a note here about a preliminary diagnosis… though honestly, the paperwork is rather…sparse. Before we delve into that, could you clarify what kind of cancer you were told about?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I don’t really know what kind. They just said it was… bad. It’s in my lungs, I think? And they sent me here. I'm sorry I can’t be more help. It all happened so fast after the tests.
DOCTOR: “Bad” isn’t terribly specific, is it?
PATIENT: No, it isn’t. I… I wish they had explained it better. I was still trying to process everything after losing my husband last year. It feels like one thing after another.
DOCTOR: Well, grief is… unfortunate, certainly. But we need to focus on this. Lungs, you said. Any cough?
PATIENT: Yes, I have a cough. It’s been getting worse for a few months now, but I thought it was just a cold that wouldn’t go away. And I get tired very easily. I used to be able to walk for hours, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: A cough for months… and fatigue. Any fever?
PATIENT: Not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I would call a fever. I haven’t taken my temperature, though. I don’t usually get sick, so I didn’t think anything of it.
DOCTOR: Right. And any… weight loss?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I hadn’t really noticed it until my friend pointed it out. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. I just figured it was the stress, to be honest. It’s been a hard year.
DOCTOR: Weight loss…stress. Very well. Let’s do a quick examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… alright. I hope it won’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be extensive. Just listening to your lungs, checking your lymph nodes…routine things. Please, have a seat. And try to relax. Now, take a deep breath for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this?
DOCTOR: And again… yes. Hmm. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just feels… normal, I guess. Like you're touching me. Is something wrong, Doctor? You're looking very serious.
DOCTOR: There is some… diminished breath sounds on the lower left lobe. And the lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged. Now, tell me about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. But nothing serious, really. My husband, he had some heart trouble… but I haven't had any real health problems until this.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, fractured arm… Your husband's heart condition…relevant, I suppose. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve only ever taken over-the-counter things for colds and headaches. I try to stay away from medicine if I can. It’s all a little overwhelming, Doctor.
DOCTOR: "Overwhelming." Yes, well, we’ll try to be…efficient. Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not even vitamins. I just… try to eat healthy and get enough rest. When I can. Are we getting closer to finding out what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: We are gathering information. Now, regarding your social history… do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked for a while, but I always told him it was bad for him. He quit a few years before he… before he passed away.
DOCTOR: Very well. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I… I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. But not often. Really. It doesn’t… sit well with me.
DOCTOR: Right. Finally, family history. Any history of cancer in your family?
PATIENT: My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer. But that was a long time ago. And my uncle had… something, I think. Lung cancer, maybe? I don’t remember all the details. It was a very difficult time. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: We are…sufficiently informed for the moment. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary report, we need to confirm a diagnosis with further imaging. A CT scan of your chest, and likely a biopsy of the lymph nodes. I'll have the nurse schedule those for you. Don't panic; these are just standard procedures. It's likely adenocarcinoma, given your history, but we must confirm. We will also send your records to an oncologist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Adeno… what? I’m sorry, I don’t understand. And an oncologist? Is that… a cancer specialist? This is a lot to take in all at once. I… I don’t know what to ask. I just want to know what’s happening to me.
DOCTOR: Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer. And yes, an oncologist is a cancer specialist. They will be able to provide you with a more detailed explanation of your condition and treatment options. Look, I understand this is overwhelming. But we'll take it one step at a time. The scan and biopsy will give us a clearer picture. I'll have the nurse come in and explain the scheduling process. Try to remain calm. And don't hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. We will get to the bottom of this. Though I must say, you really should have been more forthcoming with details from the start. It makes my job so much more difficult.
PATIENT: I… I’m sorry. I just… I get confused easily. And I didn’t want to worry anyone until I knew for sure. I just want to get better.
