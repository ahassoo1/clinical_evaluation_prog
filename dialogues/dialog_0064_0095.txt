DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It's my ear. Can't hear out of one of them, and half my face feels like it's drooping. It started yesterday, just... happened. Is that enough information to start, or do you need a detailed life story?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good start, thank you. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… that does sound concerning. We definitely need to investigate. It’s good you came in promptly. Just to clarify, which ear is it, and when exactly did you first notice the hearing loss and the drooping?
PATIENT: The left ear, naturally. And I told you, yesterday. I woke up, and it was just... gone. The face thing wasn’t immediate, maybe a few hours later I noticed it was harder to smile on that side. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a radiologist. I know what “sudden” means. Do you need me to draw you a timeline? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, my apologies. I understand you’re busy and a medical professional yourself. “Yesterday” is perfectly fine. And you're right to point that out – I shouldn't assume anything. Facial drooping that developed several hours after the hearing loss is important information. Let's just run through a few more quick questions, if you don't mind, and then we’ll do a quick exam. Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in the ears, headache, or any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No dizziness. A little bit of ringing, but I'm old, Doctor, things ring. No headache, and definitely no pain. Look, is this something serious? Because if it's just an ear infection, I really don't need a battery of tests. I have things to do. And frankly, I don’t have insurance, so keep that in mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, ringing but chronic, no headache or pain. I understand your concerns about time and cost, and I absolutely will keep your insurance situation in mind. Sudden hearing loss with facial drooping… it makes me think of something called Bell’s Palsy, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Bell's Palsy is often temporary, but it's important to get a proper diagnosis. There are other, more serious causes we need to exclude. First, let's quickly look in your ears and do a brief neurological exam – just to check your facial muscle strength and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I really don’t want anything poked or prodded for long. And please explain what you’re doing as you go. I’m a radiologist, remember? I need to know why you’re doing things, not just that you’re doing them. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors do things just to hear themselves think.
DOCTOR: A fair point! I appreciate your directness. Alright, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears with this otoscope. I'm checking for any signs of infection, blockage, or anything else unusual that might be causing the hearing loss. It won't be painful, just a quick peek. Okay, ears look relatively clear. No obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I'm going to ask you to do a few simple things – like raise your eyebrows, close your eyes tightly, smile, and puff out your cheeks. This lets me assess the strength of the facial muscles on both sides of your face. I'm looking for any weakness or asymmetry. Okay, raising eyebrows is symmetrical. Closing eyes… good. Smile… There's definite weakness on the left side. And puffing cheeks… same thing, left side doesn’t inflate as fully. It's subtle, but noticeable. These findings are consistent with weakness of the facial nerve. I am going to quickly test your corneal reflex, just to make sure your eye is protected on the left side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't poke my eye. I read about corneal reflexes, I know what you’re trying to do. But honestly, this all seems very… obvious. I mean, I told you half my face isn’t working. What’s the point of all these tests if you already suspect something’s wrong? Are you trying to justify a bill? Honestly, it's… frustrating. Just tell me what you think it is, and what we can do about it. I don’t need a lecture on facial anatomy.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask that. It is frustrating when things seem obvious, and I apologize if it feels like I’m going through the motions. However, even though your description is very helpful, I have a professional responsibility to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms before making a diagnosis. We need to be certain it’s not something more serious, like a stroke or a tumor, before attributing it to something like Bell’s Palsy. Okay, the corneal reflex is present on both sides, which is reassuring. Based on your history and the physical exam, my leading suspicion is Bell’s Palsy – paralysis of the facial nerve. It’s often caused by a viral infection, and in many cases, it resolves on its own within a few weeks or months. However, we need to consider other possibilities. Given your age and symptoms, I would recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out other causes, just to be safe. It's the most accurate way to get a definitive diagnosis. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: An MRI… honestly, it's going to be expensive, isn’t it? And I still don’t have insurance. Look, Doctor, I’m a radiologist. I understand the value of imaging. But if the likelihood is Bell’s Palsy, which is what you’re saying, and it typically resolves on its own… I’m not sure I need the added expense and worry of an MRI. Is there anything else I can do? Any medication, physical therapy… anything that might help without breaking the bank? And frankly, can you be direct? I hate beating around the bush. What are the real risks if I don’t get an MRI?
DOCTOR: You are right to question the necessity of the MRI, and I appreciate your directness. You’re a radiologist, and you understand the benefits and drawbacks of imaging very well. Let me be direct. The real risks if we don’t get an MRI are missing a rare, but more serious cause of your facial weakness, such as a tumor or stroke. These conditions require immediate treatment. However, the likelihood of those causes is low, especially given your otherwise healthy appearance. For Bell’s Palsy, the primary treatment is corticosteroids – prednisone – to reduce inflammation. We can also prescribe antiviral medications, though their benefit is still debated. Physical therapy – facial exercises – can also help prevent muscle atrophy and promote recovery. Given your financial constraints, we can proceed with a trial of corticosteroids and close monitoring without the MRI. If your symptoms don't improve within a week or two, or if they worsen, then we would strongly reconsider the imaging. We can also discuss options for financial assistance or reduced-cost imaging at the local hospital. Would you be comfortable with that approach – corticosteroids and close follow-up – and we’ll reassess in a week or two?
PATIENT: Fine. Corticosteroids, then we'll see. But please, write the prescription clearly. I've had pharmacists question my handwriting before, and I don't need that aggravation. And give me the number for that financial assistance at the hospital, just in case. Look, Doctor, I'm not trying to be difficult, but I'm a practical person. I need solutions, not hypotheticals. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just like to order tests. So, corticosteroids… what dosage? And any side effects I should be aware of? Just give me the facts, please. No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all. Practicality is exactly what we need. And you’re right to ask about side effects. I’m prescribing Prednisone, 60 milligrams, once daily, for five days, then tapering down by 10 milligrams each day for the next five days. Common side effects of Prednisone include increased appetite, difficulty sleeping, and a temporary rise in blood sugar. It can also cause mood changes. If you have diabetes or a history of stomach ulcers, it’s important to let your pharmacist know. Here’s the number for financial assistance at the hospital: 555-123-4567. Ask for the patient assistance department. They can help you determine if you qualify for reduced-cost care. I also recommend keeping the eye on the affected side moist, as you may not be able to blink fully. Artificial tears can help with that. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then – especially if you develop any weakness on the other side of your face, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Honestly, Doctor, you haven't been as bad as I expected. Still, I’m a radiologist. I’ll be monitoring my own progress, and I'll know if something isn’t right. Thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have appointments to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright, very well. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Get well soon, Stephane. .
