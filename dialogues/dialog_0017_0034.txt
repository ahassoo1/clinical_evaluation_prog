DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's… well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get signed up for healthcare stuff? I have Medicare, I think? My husband helped with that. It’s all kinda new.
DOCTOR: Right. Medicare. Yes, I see that noted here. While establishing coverage is important, that isn’t quite what a consultation with a physician entails. We address medical concerns. Do you have any current health issues you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Medical… hmm. I… I don’t really know. I mean, I get tired a lot. But everyone does, right? And my back sometimes aches after I’ve been working… I fix things, see? For a job. It’s… mechanical stuff. But it's probably just from bending over a lot. I don’t think it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: "Everyone gets tired" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Bonck. And while occupational aches are common, we need to determine the cause and severity. You state you fix “mechanical stuff.” Is this full-time employment?
PATIENT: Yeah, full-time. I’m a… a technician, I guess. I work with engines and… stuff. It’s a lot of lifting, and sometimes I’m in awkward positions. It’s… pretty physical. I don’t usually complain though. I kinda just… push through it. Does that make sense? Is pushing through it bad? I don’t wanna cause trouble.
DOCTOR: "Pushing through it" is precisely the type of behavior that creates trouble, Ms. Bonck. We're attempting to ascertain if there’s underlying pathology, not applaud stoicism. Let’s begin with a more thorough review. Do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Pathology? What’s that mean? Um… well, sometimes I get headaches. Not all the time, just when I’m really stressed, I guess? And… oh! My hands sometimes feel kinda numb. Like, when I’ve been working on something really small for a long time. But that’s probably just from, like, cutting off circulation, right? Is that normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. Bonck. Numbness in the extremities, coupled with headaches and fatigue… We need to establish a baseline. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. No chills, definitely not. Weight loss… maybe? My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t really been paying attention. And night sweats… I dunno. I kinda just sleep, you know? I'm a pretty heavy sleeper. Does that help? I don’t wanna worry you.
DOCTOR: “Not paying attention” is not a reliable medical history, Ms. Bonck. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, hypertension, asthma, anything at all?
PATIENT: Uh, no. Not that I remember. I… I haven't really been to the doctor much. Like, ever. My husband usually takes care of that stuff. He… he worries more than me. I think I had chickenpox when I was a kid, but that’s it. I don’t think I’ve had any… serious stuff. Really.
DOCTOR: And what about surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical…? I… no. I don’t think so. Definitely not. I mean, I haven’t had anything… cut open or anything. I chipped a tooth once, but that was just the dentist. Is that what you mean? Like, a real surgery?
DOCTOR: Very well. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think? And my dad… he just… he got sick, kinda quickly. It was a long time ago. I don’t really remember much about it. He passed when I was pretty young. My grandma… she lived a really long time. I think she just… got old. Is this important? I'm not very good at remembering stuff.
DOCTOR: It is critically important, Ms. Bonck. While your recollection is… lacking, we must attempt to establish a pattern. Let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! Definitely not. Never. My husband doesn't either. He… he says it's bad for you. We’re both pretty healthy, I think. Well, except for the tiredness and the aches… But that's just from the work, right?
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. Like, on weekends. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe? Or a beer if we're watching a game. Nothing crazy. We don’t… party or anything. Just, like, relaxing. Is that bad? My husband and I just like to unwind after a long week.
DOCTOR: And any illicit drug use?
PATIENT: What?! No! Absolutely not! I… I don’t even know what you mean! My husband and I are… normal people. We work hard, we pay our bills… That’s a really rude question, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: Oh. Allergies. Um… I think I’m allergic to cats. I get kinda sneezy when I’m around them. But we don’t have any pets. And… I think pollen bothers me a little in the spring. Makes my eyes itchy. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: And current medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh! Just… just ibuprofen sometimes. When my back really hurts. And… I take a multivitamin, I think. My husband buys them for me. He says it’s good to have. Is that all? I don't really take much. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Bonck, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Please proceed to the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Um… what exactly are you going to do? I’m not really good with… medical stuff. It makes me kinda anxious.
DOCTOR: A standard examination, Ms. Bonck. I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, assess your reflexes, and a few other basic checks. It's entirely routine. Please lie down on the table, face up. We will begin with auscultation of the chest.
PATIENT: Auscultation…? Is that going to hurt? And… is it cold? I'm a little chilly, actually.
DOCTOR: It will not hurt, Ms. Bonck. Auscultation simply involves listening to your internal sounds with this instrument. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but clear. No wheezes or crackles auscultated. Heart rate is regular at 72 beats per minute. Normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout all lobes…
PATIENT: Is everything okay? What did you hear? Did you find anything bad? You're not going to send me to a hospital, are you? I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, you are perfectly healthy, aside from a slight tendency towards anxiety, which, frankly, is exacerbated by your relentless questioning. However, for the sake of thoroughness, I will proceed with palpation of your abdomen. Please lie back down, and inform me if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Ouch. That's a little… tender there. Not really painful, just… uncomfortable. I think I might have pulled a muscle when I was fixing that engine last week. It was really heavy. Is that what you're feeling?
DOCTOR: Tenderness is mild, localized to the right lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and bowel sounds are normoactive. No palpable masses or organomegaly detected. Now, we will assess your deep tendon reflexes… Please keep your legs relaxed.
PATIENT: Deep tendon… what? What are you going to do? Ouch! That tickles! And… is it normal that my leg jumped like that? Is something wrong with my nerves?
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal for your leg to "jump", Ms. Bonck. That is a reflex response. It indicates that your nervous system is functioning adequately. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, symmetric, and within normal limits. Very well. Based on my examination, your physical findings are largely unremarkable. However, given your fatigue and occasional headaches, I recommend a basic blood work panel, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… good. So, I’m not, like, really sick? Blood work…? Will that hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have to get back to work tomorrow. And… what if something is wrong? What will you do then?
DOCTOR: The blood work involves a simple venipuncture, a minor inconvenience at worst. It will take approximately 24-48 hours for the results to be processed. If any abnormalities are detected, we will discuss further evaluation and management options. However, based on my initial assessment, I do not anticipate any serious findings. I will now generate a lab order for you to take to the testing center. And Ms. Bonck, please attempt to manage your anxiety. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Here you go. The testing center is located at [address]. Please schedule an appointment at your convenience. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s it. But… what if I forget to schedule the appointment? Or what if I can’t get off work? This is a lot to remember. Could you… maybe just write down a reminder for me? Or… call and schedule it for me? I really appreciate your help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, I am a physician, not a personal assistant. It is your responsibility to manage your own healthcare. I have provided you with the necessary order; it is now incumbent upon you to schedule the appointment and ensure its completion. I am concluding this consultation. If you have any medical concerns, please contact my office. Otherwise, have a pleasant day.
