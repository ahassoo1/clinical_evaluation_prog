DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… it hurt. And heart… flutters. Like bird. Blood pressure, wife say high. Want quick, okay? Busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain and a fluttering sensation in your heart, and your wife has noticed your blood pressure is high. We'll try to be as quick as possible. First, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? It hurts! Like… squeezed. Not always. Sometimes when I… walk fast. Or upset. Wife yelling, maybe. Not… big pain, but annoying. Old man problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a squeezing sensation, not constant, and seems to be brought on by activity or stress, like when you're walking quickly or feeling upset. You mentioned it’s not a big pain, but more of an annoyance. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Hmm. Long time. Maybe… six months? Hard to say. Old man forget things. Wife keep saying “chest pain, chest pain!” like broken record. Maybe longer. Don’t make me think too hard.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll figure it out. Six months is helpful to know. So, the pain has been present for around six months, and your wife has been noticing it as well. Does the pain radiate anywhere – for example, to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What mean… go somewhere else? Sometimes… left arm feel… heavy. Not always with pain. Just… tired. And jaw… maybe. Hard to tell. Everything tired these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes you feel a heaviness in your left arm and possibly some discomfort in your jaw. It sounds like it doesn’t always happen with the chest pain. Let's talk a little bit about other things. Do you get short of breath at all, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Short breath? Little bit. When climb stairs. Or… when wife yelling! Make me nervous. Not… bad. Just… puff puff. Old man lungs, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, like climbing stairs, and sometimes when you're feeling stressed. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, wife say. Doctor… many doctors. Take pills. White pills. And… something else. Can't remember. Too many pills, too many doctors. Old man brain not so good anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can try to figure it out. You are currently taking medication for high blood pressure, as your wife has mentioned. Do you happen to know the names of any of the other medications you take, or could you bring a list with you next time?
PATIENT: List? No list. Just… take what wife give me. She handle everything. I just… old man. Don’t need to worry about pills, she say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife manages your medications. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… long time ago. Appendicitis when young. And… broken leg. Fall down. Many years ago. That’s all I remember. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendicitis when you were younger and a broken leg at some point. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or children – who has had any heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm. Mother… she die old. Very old. Father… he smoke too much. Cough a lot. I think… maybe heart trouble. Not sure. Not talk about such things. Old country people, you know? Don’t talk about sickness. Bad luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother lived to be very old, and your father smoked and had a cough, potentially indicating a heart condition. Now, do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Bad for you. Wife yell at me if I even think about it. She very strict. Father smoke, yes. But not me.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Little bit. With dinner. Small glass of soju. Wife drink too. Not much. Just… relax. Old country custom.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of soju with dinner. And finally, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise? Ha! What mean exercise? Walk to market. Walk dog. That exercise enough for old man. Not run marathon, you know? Busy man, even old man.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. Walking to the market and walking the dog is good activity. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Hurry up. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, as your wife mentioned. Now I’ll listen to your heart. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, but I don't hear anything concerning. And finally, let me listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear, although the sounds are a little quieter than usual. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here on your chest?
PATIENT: No! Stop poking! Old man bones, you know? Sensitive. Don’t like being poked. Just… leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. It’s good to know where any sensitivity is. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The irregularity in your heart rhythm and the elevated blood pressure are also factors we need to address. I think it would be best to do some further testing, like an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm, and potentially a blood test to check your cholesterol levels. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood test? More poking and prodding? Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Wife will yell if I don’t. But make it quick! I have appointments!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get it done as quickly as possible. I'll have my nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we'll do the EKG right here in the room. While we wait for the results, I’m going to write down some instructions about managing your symptoms. It’s important to avoid strenuous activity, and if you feel chest pain, stop immediately and rest. Is there anyone who can help you get to your appointments?
PATIENT: Wife. She drive. She always drive. She control everything. Just… don’t want to worry her. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good that you have someone to help you. While we wait for the results of the EKG, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just want to go home. Make it quick, doctor. Please. Old man tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll get you home as soon as we can. Let me check the results… Okay, the EKG shows some changes that suggest a previous heart attack and some thickening of the heart muscle. I’m going to consult with a cardiologist to get their opinion on the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of aspirin to help prevent blood clots, and a medication to help control your blood pressure. Would you like me to write a note for your wife explaining these changes and the new medications?
PATIENT: Aspirin? More pills? Fine. Whatever. Just… write the note for wife. She need to know everything. Don’t want her yelling. And hurry up!
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Sobkowicz. This explains everything in detail. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment with the cardiologist as soon as possible. In the meantime, please avoid strenuous activity and if you experience any chest pain, stop immediately and rest. Do you have any questions about the medications or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: No! Just… go. I want to go home. Thank you, doctor. I got appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll have my nurse escort you to the checkout desk. Please take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. It was nice meeting you.
