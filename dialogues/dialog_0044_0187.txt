DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Not much pleasure here, honestly. Chest hurts. Been feeling…flappy. Like a fish. And the number machine at the store? Always high. Very high. I don’t like it. Get on with it, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. We’ll get right to it. “Chest hurts” and feeling “flappy” – I want to understand both of those a bit better. When you say your chest hurts, can you tell me where exactly it hurts?
PATIENT: Right… here. Not sharp, not like broken. Dull. Like… heavy. And the flappy? It's when I walk up stairs. Or… sometimes just when I think about walking up stairs. Makes no sense, I know. Don’t ask me to explain. It just… happens. Quick now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache low down in the chest, worse with exertion or even thinking about exertion. That’s helpful. And it feels…flappy?
PATIENT: Yes! Flappy! Like a… a flag in the wind. Very annoying. And it's not just stairs. Sometimes just… standing. I used to be strong, you know. Very strong. Now… It’s embarrassing. Just fix it. What pills you gonna give me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life, and we want to get to the bottom of it. Before we talk about pills, let's try to understand why you're feeling this way. I want to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. It will help me to determine the best course of action. First, have you noticed any shortness of breath with this chest pain, or at any other time?
PATIENT: Shortness of… breath? Sometimes. Not always. When I… rush. Or if I try to lift heavy things. Like I said, used to be strong. It’s just old age, probably. Don't need a lot of tests. Just give me something for the… flappy and the high number. My wife keeps telling me to come here, but I don’t see what good it’s doing. It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I assure you, we'll be as efficient as possible. But even if it is just old age, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. You mentioned a "high number" - are you referring to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes! The number machine! Every time I go to the store, the lady makes a face. She says it’s too high. My wife writes it down. Very high numbers. It's very annoying. Makes me nervous just thinking about it. What kind of tests are you gonna do? More poking and prodding? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, high blood pressure readings, chest pain, and this feeling of "flappiness" with exertion. We'll do a basic physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, just to get a baseline. I also want to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing – any swelling in your ankles or feet, dizziness, or headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Sometimes. Dull. Like… the chest. Ankles… A little puffy, maybe. My wife says so. She notices everything. I mostly just feel tired. Very tired. And irritated. Like right now. Get on with it. I don’t have all day. And no poking, understand? Just… quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no excessive poking, I promise. Just a quick listen and check. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax for a moment?
PATIENT: Hurry up. This is a waste of time. My wife will be wondering where I am. And she'll be asking questions. Many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 162 over 95. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I hear some mild fluid in your lungs. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? That's what the lady at the store said. Fluid? In my lungs? What does that mean? Am I sick? My wife told me I should see a specialist… a heart specialist. Don’t tell me I need surgery. I don't want surgery. Just… give me something for the flappy and the high numbers. And let me go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, let’s not jump to conclusions. Fluid in your lungs can have several causes, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Your irregular heartbeat is also something we need to investigate, but again, it doesn’t automatically mean surgery. I want to be thorough, so I’m going to order a few tests. A chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, an EKG to check your heart rhythm in more detail, and some blood work to check your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Do whatever you have to do. But if it takes all day, I'm blaming you. And my wife. She'll be furious. Can I at least have a glass of water? This whole thing is making my mouth dry. And hurry up, please. The flappy is getting worse just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, a glass of water is a good idea. I’ll have the nurse bring one right over. The tests shouldn’t take too long – the X-ray will be quick, and the blood work is fairly straightforward. I'll also have the nurse check your oxygen saturation while we wait. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any prescriptions?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Don't take anything. Never needed to. Strong man, I told you. Well, used to be. Just… get the tests done. I want to go home. And don’t tell my wife about anything serious, understand? She worries too much. It's exhausting. Just fix the flappy. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, and we'll keep your wife informed only about essential information. I'll order the tests now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and take you for the X-ray. While we wait for the results, I’m going to ask a few questions about your diet and activity level. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. Alcohol… maybe a little beer sometimes. With dinner. Not much. My wife says it’s bad for my numbers. She’s very strict about those numbers. Everything is about the numbers with her. Just… hurry up. I don’t want to be here all day. And no poking. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, minimal alcohol intake. Good. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. The nurse should be with you any moment now. In the meantime, try to relax. I know this is frustrating, but we're working to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Is there anything else you think is important for me to know right now?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes, at night… I wake up feeling short of breath. Like I’m choking. But it goes away after a few minutes. And… I’ve been gaining weight. My wife says so. Everything is about the weight and the numbers. And the flappy. Just fix the flappy. That’s all I ask. Can I have that water yet? I’m really thirsty. And don’t tell my wife about the choking. She'll have a heart attack.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. So, shortness of breath at night, weight gain, chest pain, flappiness with exertion, high blood pressure readings, and an irregular heartbeat. That gives us a good starting point. The nurse should be right here with the water and to take you for the tests. We'll get everything done quickly and efficiently. And I assure you, we won’t tell your wife about the choking unless it becomes absolutely necessary. Let’s focus on getting you some answers and feeling better. Here comes the nurse now.
PATIENT: Hurry it up. Just… get it over with. And no poking. Please. This is exhausting. .
DOCTOR: We will, Mr. Sobkowicz. We will. The nurse will take good care of you. .
