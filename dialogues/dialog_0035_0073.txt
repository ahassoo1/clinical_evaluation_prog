DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Please have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It's… well, it’s my stomach. It just won’t stop. I've been to doctors about it before, and nothing they gave me worked. Honestly, I’m starting to think they just don’t know what they’re doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're frustrated and short on time. We’ll do our best to figure this out. When you say “won’t stop,” can you tell me a little more about what’s going on with your stomach?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's… diarrhea. A lot of it. For, like, weeks now. It's not just a little upset, it's… constant. And it doesn't matter what I eat. I’ve tried cutting things out, bland food, everything. It just… goes right through me. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. I don't even want to leave the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant diarrhea for weeks, despite dietary changes. And it's significantly impacting your daily life. I appreciate you telling me that. To help me understand what might be going on, can you describe what the diarrhea looks like?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really want to talk about what it looks like. It’s… watery. Brown, mostly. Sometimes… not. Look, is this going somewhere or are you just going to ask me a bunch of personal questions? I’ve already wasted half my morning.
DOCTOR: I understand this is unpleasant to discuss, and I apologize for that. But these details are important to help determine the cause. I assure you, everything you tell me is confidential and necessary for your care. Okay, watery stools, sometimes not brown… Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Mucus, now? Are you serious? I… I think maybe, sometimes. It's hard to tell, honestly. It's all just… a mess. Look, I'm not a doctor. I just know it's bad and it won’t go away. I already told you that. Is there anything you can do about it, or are we just going to play twenty questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, mucus sometimes present. I’m sorry you’re feeling so frustrated and unheard. We will try to figure this out. It sounds like this has been going on for a while, and it's significantly impacting your quality of life, which is concerning. To get a better understanding, let’s back up a bit. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain with this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Nausea, sometimes, but not much. More just… weak. And my stomach cramps, yeah. A lot. Like, really bad cramps. It feels like it's twisting up in knots. But it comes and goes, it's not constant like… this. I just want it to stop. Are you going to give me something or what? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, occasional nausea, weakness, and cramping. Cramping sounds pretty significant. Before we talk about potential treatments, I need to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, yeah, actually. I haven't really thought about it, but my clothes are fitting looser. Not a lot, but… noticeable. I haven’t been eating much, obviously, with everything going on. I just… don’t have much of an appetite. It feels like whatever I eat just makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss and decreased appetite. That’s important to know. And this has been going on for weeks, correct?
PATIENT: Weeks. Months, even. It comes and goes in waves, but it’s always there, lurking. Honestly, I just thought I was getting old. Or… stressed. But this is ridiculous. I’m starting to think it’s something serious. Are you going to order some tests, finally? I don't have time for this guessing game.
DOCTOR: You’re right, we need to investigate further. Given the duration of your symptoms – weeks to months – the weight loss, and the cramping, I want to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, I’d like to check a stool sample to look for any infections or parasites. We’ll also do some blood work to check for inflammation, rule out other potential causes, and assess your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have a life, you know. How long is this going to take? And will I have to come back for more of this? Because I’m really not interested in becoming a permanent fixture in this office.
DOCTOR: Okay. The stool sample kit will take a few minutes to collect, and we'll draw blood right here in the office. The blood work results usually take 2-3 business days. I’ll also need to ask you some questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any previous surgeries or medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Let's see… I had my gallbladder out… oh, about ten years ago. And I had pneumonia once, but that was ages ago. Nothing else really. My husband… he passed away a few years back. It was… sudden. And that’s about it, honestly. I’m a pretty healthy person, usually. This… this is new. And very unwelcome.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, pneumonia in the past, and I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None. I can take pretty much anything. Look, is there anything else you need to know? Because honestly, I’m starting to feel lightheaded just sitting here. I really need to get going. I have errands to run and… things to do. This is taking up my entire day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I apologize for the delay. We’re almost finished. One last thing: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my arthritis flares up, but that’s not often. Honestly, I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I don't like feeling… drugged up. That's it. No fancy pills, no special treatments. Just a basic old lady trying to get by. Now, can we please be done?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Alright, Ms. Woodring, I’ve got all the information I need for now. I’m going to order the stool sample and blood work as we discussed. In the meantime, please try to stay hydrated and eat small, bland meals. I’ll have the results sent to me and will call you as soon as I have them to discuss the next steps. If you experience any severe symptoms, such as high fever, bloody stools, or dehydration, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… call me. Don't make me come back here. Honestly, I’m not sure I could face another one of these appointments. And please, don’t bother me with anything trivial. If it’s important, you'll call. If it’s not… leave me alone. Thank you. Or… whatever. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I understand. I’ll call you with any significant findings. The nurse will give you the instructions for the stool sample collection and draw your blood. Have a good day.
