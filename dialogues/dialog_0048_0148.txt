DOCTOR: Right. Noelani Stepno, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um... it's a bit embarrassing, actually. It's… well, it’s pain. Down there. It’s hard to explain, and I… I don’t quite remember when it started, to be honest. It’s just been… bothering me.
DOCTOR: "Down there," alright. Pain in the pelvic region. It’s…common. And don't worry about it being embarrassing; we deal with this all the time. You say you don't recall when it started. Roughly, can you estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Roughly… Maybe a few weeks? Or a month? It's all a bit… fuzzy. I've been quite busy with the woodworking, you see, and… things just sort of blend together. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache? Sometimes. And… sometimes it feels heavier than usual, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A few weeks to a month. Dull ache, with occasional heaviness. Woodworking, noted. Heaviness… can you be more specific about that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s hard to describe. Like… a weight. Not necessarily painful, but just… present. It’s… different than normal. And it feels… full? I'm probably not explaining this very well. It’s just… uncomfortable, and I wanted to be sure everything was alright. I haven’t had this feeling before.
DOCTOR: Alright. A sensation of fullness and heaviness. Not necessarily painful, but definitely new. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… I don’t think so. No fever, no… discharge. No changes in urination. Everything seems normal, besides the… ache and fullness. Oh! I have been a little more tired than usual, now that I think about it. But I just assumed it was from working long hours in the shop. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: No fever, no discharge, no urinary changes. Increased fatigue… potentially. Alright. And are your menstrual cycles regular?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, doctor… that’s a bit of a complicated question. They’ve been… irregular for a while now. Especially with the stress of the shop. It's been… unpredictable. I haven't really kept track, to be honest. I suppose that could be the reason for the tiredness, too?
DOCTOR: Irregular cycles… unpredictable. Right. We'll need to explore that further. Now, have you experienced any bleeding between periods?
PATIENT: Bleeding between periods… Not that I recall. No, I don’t think so. Like I said, everything has been… unpredictable, so it’s hard to say for certain. I might have noticed something, but I… well, I haven’t been paying very close attention, truthfully. It’s just been a busy time. Is that bad? Should I have noticed?
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal that you haven't been closely monitoring. But we’ll work with what we have. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. I have… well, the doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a few years back, but I haven't needed to take it lately. It was just slightly elevated, he said. And I’ve had the usual things, you know… colds, flu. Nothing serious. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful? I’m not really one for doctors, if I’m honest. I try to avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: History of slightly elevated blood pressure, now resolved. Medicare noted. Alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don't think so. Not that I can remember. Nothing major, anyway. I did have my wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that was… a long time ago. And… oh! I had a mole removed from my arm a few years back, but it was just a small thing. Nothing serious, the doctor said. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal, mole removal… noted. Alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. He passed away a few years ago. And my aunt… she had diabetes, I believe. But that’s about all I can remember, to be honest. My family isn’t very good at talking about these things. It’s just not something we do.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, heart trouble, diabetes… noted. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything. I can take most medications without any problems. I haven’t had to take many, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you see. But… honestly, doctor, I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed. All these questions… it’s making me anxious. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get through this. Now, I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be gentle. And… could you explain what you’re doing as you go? I get a little anxious when I don’t know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll do a quick abdominal exam. After that, I’ll need to do a pelvic exam. This is to assess the source of your discomfort. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A pelvic exam… right. Please, do be gentle. And… could you tell me what you’re listening for? Just so I know… you know. It helps me relax a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening for any unusual sounds - murmurs, clicks, or wheezes - that might indicate a problem with your heart or lungs. Your breathing sounds clear. Heart rate is regular, a little elevated perhaps due to anxiety, but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… A little. Just… a dull ache. Like I’ve been describing. It’s not sharp, it’s just… uncomfortable. It’s mostly lower down, on this side. And… it feels a little… swollen? I don’t know if that’s just my imagination. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness there, as you mentioned. I do feel a slight fullness, but nothing alarming at this point. Now, I’m going to need to proceed with the pelvic exam. I’ve already explained what that involves. Please let me know if you have any questions before we begin. We can pause at any time.
PATIENT: Oh… Is… is there anything else you can tell me about why you need to do that? Just so I know what to expect. I… I’ve never had one before, and I’m a little frightened, to be honest. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: The pelvic exam allows me to assess your reproductive organs – the vagina, cervix, uterus, and ovaries – for any abnormalities. It helps me determine the cause of your pelvic pain and rule out any potential issues. It might feel uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be excruciatingly painful. I will be as gentle as possible, and you can tell me to stop at any time. I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vagina so I can visualize the cervix, and then I’ll palpate your uterus and ovaries. It will take just a few moments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… I think so. It just… sounds a little scary. Okay. I… I guess I’m ready. But please, please be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, okay? Just so I know…
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just going to insert the speculum now. It may feel cold and a little uncomfortable. I'm using lubricant to make it easier. Take a few deep breaths. Now I’m looking at your cervix. It appears… slightly inflamed. I’m going to take a swab to check for any infection. That might sting a little. Now, I’m going to palpate your uterus and ovaries. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or masses. Does this feel painful anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh! Ooh, that did sting a little. And… yes, it’s a little tender on this side. When you press there, it feels… full, like there’s something there. Not painful, exactly, but… definitely something. Is that bad? What does it mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, we’re finished with the exam. Now, based on the examination and your history, it’s possible you have a mild pelvic inflammatory disease or a functional cyst on your ovary. The inflammation is minimal, but it’s enough to cause some discomfort. A functional cyst is common and often resolves on its own. However, to be certain, I want to order some blood tests and a pelvic ultrasound. The blood tests will check for infection, and the ultrasound will help visualize your reproductive organs. I’ll also order a urine sample to rule out a urinary tract infection. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… Pelvic inflammatory disease? That sounds… serious. And a cyst? What does that mean? Will I need surgery? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? I… I get anxious when I don’t know what’s happening. Is there anything I can do in the meantime to feel better? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease can be serious if left untreated, but the inflammation appears mild, and we're addressing it now. A functional cyst is usually harmless and often disappears on its own. Surgery is unlikely at this stage. We need the test results to determine the best course of action. The results should be available in about 3-5 business days. In the meantime, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to manage the discomfort. Avoid strenuous activity and sexual intercourse until we have the results. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever just in case. It’s important to follow up with me once you have the results so we can discuss the next steps. This has the lab order and my contact information. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Ibuprofen… yes, that’s good. And no strenuous activity. That’s… that’s understandable. What about… what about the chance it’s something serious? What if it’s… I get very anxious, doctor. It’s just… hard for me to deal with uncertainty.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re asking questions, and I understand your anxiety. It's important to remember that we’re still gathering information. The most likely scenario is a minor inflammation or a functional cyst, but we need the test results to confirm. If it turns out to be something more serious, we will discuss all your options and create a treatment plan together. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focus on managing your discomfort. I will call you as soon as the results are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about the instructions I’ve given you?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. No, I think I understand. Ibuprofen, no strenuous activity, wait for the results, and call you. Thank you, doctor. You’ve… you’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I think that’s all for now. I’ll… I’ll wait for your call. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. Let’s hope for the best. .
