DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Havird, right? Yes, yes. It’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, you understand. More like… a squeezing. Like a tight band. It started, hmm… maybe a week ago? It’s a little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a week. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say exactly, you know? I don’t always pay attention to dates like that. But definitely not longer than two weeks, I think. It happens when I walk a lot, mostly. Or when I get… excited. Not really excited, just… a little worked up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, exertion and… emotional upset bring it on. And you’d describe it as a squeezing sensation?
PATIENT: Yes, squeezing is good. Like someone is… hugging my chest too tight. Not painful all the time, but… uncomfortable. And yes, when I’m doing things, like walking the dog, or if my husband and I… disagree. Little disagreements, you know? Nothing big. Just… enough to get my heart going a little faster. It doesn’t last long, usually. Maybe five or ten minutes. And then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this squeezing been getting worse over the past week?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe a little? It used to just be when I really pushed myself, walking up a big hill or something. But now… I felt it yesterday just when I was making dinner. Nothing heavy, just chopping vegetables. That’s new. It worries me a bit, because I haven’t changed anything. I eat the same things, walk the same distance… It just… started happening easier, I guess.
DOCTOR: So, it’s becoming more frequent, and occurring with less exertion. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms with this squeezing?
PATIENT: Oh! Symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes, when it happens, I get a little… short of breath. Not like I’m struggling for air, but like… I need to take a few deeper breaths. And… my left arm feels a little… heavy. Not always, though. Just sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a bad pain, exactly. More like a… tiredness. And sometimes a little sweat. Just a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be clear, you’re describing this heaviness and tiredness in your left arm?
PATIENT: Yes, left arm. Definitely the left. Not the right. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not like it’s hurting, exactly. Just… feels like I’ve been carrying something heavy. Like after I’ve been gardening for a long time. A dull… tiredness. It doesn’t go all the way down to my fingers, though. Just… my upper arm.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My doctor back in Colombia, he told me years ago I had a little bit of high blood pressure. But it wasn’t so bad. I took some pills for a while, but then I moved here and… I didn’t really keep up with it. And I don’t think the doctors here have ever mentioned it. And cholesterol… I don’t remember. I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have a list of current medications with you?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I just take a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s… a small white pill. I get it from the pharmacy, but I don’t have the bottle with me. It’s not important, really. Just helps with the stiffness. I don’t remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take your blood pressure. It's just a routine check, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It’s just… it worries me a little, this chest thing. I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breath in… and out… again… alright. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Your heart… I am hearing a slight murmur, which you may have had for a while. It’s not immediately concerning, but we will need to investigate further. Now let’s check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I never knew I had a murmur. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. But I always try to be healthy! I eat my vegetables, I walk my dog…
DOCTOR: A murmur just means there's an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn’t automatically mean anything is wrong, but it's something we need to look into, especially given your symptoms and the history of high blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 145/90. It's not critically high, but it's higher than ideal. Now, I want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your cholesterol and other levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… and blood work… Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I don’t want to worry my husband. He gets very anxious. So, if it’s not serious… that would be good. Is it going to hurt? The blood work, I mean.
DOCTOR: The EKG is completely painless. We just put some stickers on your chest. As for the blood work, it will be a small prick, you’ll barely feel it. It’s standard procedure, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, stickers! That doesn’t sound so bad. And a little prick… I suppose I can handle that. My husband, he’s always getting little scratches from gardening. It's nothing compared to that. So, where do we do these things? And how long will it take? I have to pick up my granddaughter from school later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The EKG technician is just down the hall, in room three. It will only take about ten minutes. Then we'll get the blood work done right here in the lab, which will take another ten or so. We should be done well before you need to pick up your granddaughter. The results will take a few days to come back, but I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of medication to help lower your blood pressure and a referral to a cardiologist. They will want to do a more thorough evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But yes, if that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And medication… I’m not fond of taking pills, but if it will help… yes, alright. Low dose is good. I don't want to feel all… sleepy or something. So, room three for the stickers, and then the blood work. And then you’ll call me when you have the results. Okay. I think I can remember all that. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to room three. Just try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I will try. It's just… all this talk of cardiologists and murmurs… It makes me a little nervous. But I’ll try to relax. Thank you again, Doctor Havird. You've been very… thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright. See you soon.
