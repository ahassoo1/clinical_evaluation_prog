DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doctor, it's…well, it's about having a baby. I want one, and I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he was a good man, but we… we didn’t have much luck the first time, and frankly, I don't have the patience for a repeat of that. I just want to make sure everything's alright before I even try, you know? No problems, no fuss. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: “Easy” isn’t usually a word I associate with conception, Ms. Villarreal, but I understand your concerns. It’s wise to get a check-up beforehand. Let’s start with some basics. You're 43, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, 43. Though I don't see what my age has to do with anything. I feel fine. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Honestly, I ate better than most people, even after… well. Look, can we just get this over with? I have things to do. Is there a test for… for making sure it’ll just happen?
DOCTOR: Feeling fine and the actual physiological realities of the situation are… distinct concepts, Ms. Villarreal. Age absolutely has to do with it, as does prior reproductive history. It impacts egg quality and quantity. But we can certainly run some tests. First, let's go over your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was ages ago. I had… something with my appendix when I was little. And, um… I had a C-section with… with my son. Other than that, nothing. Really. I don't get sick, I eat right, and I exercise. It’s probably just a waste of time, but I guess you have to ask these things. Can we just… skip to the part where you tell me if I’m okay?
DOCTOR: The C-section is relevant. An appendectomy…less so. Skipping important steps isn’t how responsible medical care works, Ms. Villarreal. We need a complete picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I take… well, I took some blood pressure medicine, but that was after… never mind. Look, is this going to be a long process? Because I really don’t have time for a lot of questions. I just want to know if I need to… you know… prepare for disappointment.
DOCTOR: You mentioned blood pressure medication. Was that for a prolonged period?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! For a few years, after… after my husband passed. It made me… tired, so I stopped taking it when I could. The doctor said it was fine, as long as I kept an eye on it. It’s been normal ever since, really. Honestly, I just want to know if this whole baby thing is going to be a problem. Is my body still… working, you know? Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your desire for expediency. However, "working" is a rather broad term. We need to assess several factors. Have you been tracking your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Tracking? Seriously? No! Who has time for that? I just… know when they come. Look, Doctor, I’m a busy woman. I don’t need a detailed calendar of my… monthly events. I just want to be told whether or not I can realistically expect to get pregnant without a whole lot of… hassle. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It is difficult to assess your hormone levels and overall reproductive health without some data, Ms. Villarreal. It's not simply about wanting to know; it’s about having the information needed to provide appropriate care. Fine. We'll do some blood work to start. That will give us a baseline. Then, depending on those results, we may need to consider a pelvic ultrasound.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Blood work, ultrasound… whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… It's just… undignified. And please, don't tell me a lot of complicated things. Just… yes or no. Can I have a baby easily, or not? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's irresponsible to guarantee a specific outcome, Ms. Villarreal. I can’t provide a simple “yes” or “no” answer. But we can determine if there are any immediate red flags. Let's start with the blood work. I’ll need to draw a few vials. We’ll check your hormone levels, complete blood count, and some basic metabolic markers. Please follow me, and we’ll get that done. The lab technician will explain the process.
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Just get it done. And make it quick. Honestly, I have more important things to do than spend all day in a doctor's office. .
