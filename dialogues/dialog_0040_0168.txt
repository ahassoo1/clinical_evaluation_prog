DOCTOR: Right. Esthela Pandolfi, 44. Medicare. Look, I’m rather busy today, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osga, it’s about this… gentleman I’ve been seeing. It’s all rather new, you understand, and I simply want to be certain everything is… as it should be. One must be prudent, especially at our age. It’s not like when we were girls, things aren't as straightforward.
DOCTOR: "Gentleman," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Mr. Caldwell. He’s… a retired accountant. Perfectly respectable, I assure you. Though, he does have a rather unfortunate fondness for plaid. It’s the principle of the thing, you see. One expects a certain level of… discernment. But that’s beside the point. I’m concerned about… well, the usual things. You know. Making sure everything is… healthy. Before things go any further, of course.
DOCTOR: Right. “The usual things.” Look, are we talking about a sexually transmitted infection screening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor. While I appreciate your… directness, let's not be vulgar. It's not that sort of concern, not precisely. Though, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to be certain. No, I’m more… concerned about my general well-being. Ensuring I am in good health, you understand. Before I commit to anything serious. It’s simply responsible. Are you going to ask me about my medical history, or are we going to sit here discussing men's fashion all day?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's get this over with. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have a touch of arthritis in my knees. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just a little stiffness in the mornings. And my blood pressure runs slightly elevated, but I watch my salt intake. My primary care physician, Dr. Ramirez, has been monitoring it. He's quite good, though I do wish he had a better sense of style. Honestly, the man wears the most dreadful ties. But, to answer your question, nothing serious. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just a tonsillectomy when I was a child, Doctor. A perfectly routine procedure. And I had a rather unpleasant bout with wisdom teeth years ago, but I hardly consider that a surgery, more of an… extraction. It was quite traumatic, actually. The dentist was a young man, very clumsy. Honestly, the whole experience was quite dreadful. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging my childhood mishaps?
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my mother, God rest her soul, had diabetes. Type 2, I believe. And my father had heart problems. He wasn't one for watching his diet, you see. Loved his fried chicken, he did. A perfectly good man, but rather reckless with his health. And my aunt Mildred, on my mother’s side, had… well, I believe it was breast cancer. It's all rather bleak, isn't it? It does make one think twice about everything. Do you need a detailed genealogy, Doctor, or are we focusing on the pertinent details?
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Just a slight sensitivity to penicillin, Doctor. A mild rash, nothing life-threatening. And I find that certain perfumes give me a headache, particularly those with a strong floral scent. Honestly, some people have no consideration for others. It’s simply dreadful to be overwhelmed by such strong odors. Are we nearing the conclusion of this… inquiry? I do have a luncheon engagement, you understand.
DOCTOR: And you're currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, as I mentioned earlier. And I occasionally take ibuprofen for my arthritis, only when it flares up, of course. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, you understand. It's simply not natural. Honestly, all these chemicals… it’s rather frightening. Are we quite finished, Doctor? I’m beginning to feel rather lightheaded. Perhaps it’s the scent of disinfectant. It's quite overpowering.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just have a quick listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll check your blood pressure, just to confirm. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. Not ideal, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Any unusual symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I've been feeling rather… fatigued lately. Just a general lack of energy, you understand. And I do seem to be sleeping more than usual. It could be the stress, of course. Worrying about this… gentleman. And my appetite has been rather poor. Nothing tastes quite right, to be honest. Honestly, it’s all rather unsettling. Is that what you were looking for? Or are we expecting me to recite the symptoms of every known ailment?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, family history and current symptoms… it could be a number of things. We’ll need to run some blood work to rule out anything serious. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid function test. And a urinalysis, just to be thorough. I’ll order them now. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those tests… it sounds rather… extensive, doesn't it? Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, couldn't we simply monitor my symptoms for a while? Honestly, I’m not particularly fond of needles. And all the waiting… it’s simply dreadful. Are you certain it’s not just stress? Perhaps a change of scenery would suffice. Honestly, I do believe a holiday is in order.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your concerns. However, it's my professional obligation to rule out potential underlying medical conditions. Ignoring these symptoms could be detrimental to your health. The tests are standard procedure, and frankly, non-negotiable. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse draw the samples now. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. Though I must say, I find it rather unsettling to be subjected to such… invasive procedures. Honestly, I do believe a cup of tea would be in order before this ordeal commences. It’s simply dreadful to face such things on an empty stomach. And please, do ensure the nurse is… gentle. I have a rather low tolerance for discomfort.
DOCTOR: I’ll have the nurse bring you some tea. Please, just try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
