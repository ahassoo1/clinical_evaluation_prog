DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… am here for this… telehealth thing? My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I not so good with the computers, so she say to come here instead. She worry about my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful. So, it's your back that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Yes. It… hurts. Not all the time, but when I bend over, or… lift things. It started a few months ago, I think. Maybe longer? It is hard to remember exactly. It not a sharp pain, more… a dull ache. It makes it hard to do things around the house, you know? Gardening… cleaning… things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache that worsens with bending and lifting… that gives me a little more to work with. And it’s affecting your ability to do things you enjoy, that's important to address. Could you tell me a little more about where exactly on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Hmm… it is… lower back. Not high up, more… where the pants go. On both sides, mostly. Sometimes more on the left. Not in my hips, though. Mostly… the back. Is that… clear? I try to explain good.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, Ms. Benites. Lower back, both sides, sometimes more on the left, and not radiating into your hips. That's helpful. Has anything specific made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… yes. I was helping my grandson with his… trampoline. He is very big boy now! I was trying to hold it steady while he jumped. That made it very bad for two days. But it get little better now. Just still… achey. I take some pills, the white ones, but they not help so much. My daughter give them to me. I not remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was aggravated by helping your grandson, and the white pills aren't providing much relief. Do you remember approximately how long ago you were helping him with the trampoline?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… last week, I think. Maybe eight days ago? It was hot day. He very excited, and I not want to say no. He is good boy, but very strong! It was Saturday, I think. Yes, definitely Saturday.
DOCTOR: Okay, last Saturday. And you said the pain is a dull ache. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you can imagine, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. It is not so bad right now. Maybe… a four? Sometimes it is higher, like a six when I try to get out of chair. But right now… a four. Yes, a four, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four right now, with it sometimes reaching a six when getting up from a chair. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness. My feet sometimes… feel cold, but that is just old age, I think. No tingling, no weakness. I can walk good. I can stand good. I can… everything good, just back hurts.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And you mentioned taking some pills your daughter gave you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I take some pills for my blood pressure, the little blue ones, but I have take them for many years, and I do not have… reaction. No, I do not have allergies. I think. My daughter always ask me if I have reaction to something, but I not remember ever having one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My old bones are not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, could you please lie down on your back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go… Is this good? I am not so good at this anymore.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just relax as much as you can. I’m going to start by feeling along your spine and the muscles on either side to check for any tenderness or tightness. I'll also ask you to move your legs in a few different directions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Just… not too much pulling, please? My back… it is sensitive. I not want to make it worse. Go slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine… and the muscles on either side. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there… on the left side. That one hurts a little. Not so bad, but… yes, that is tender. A little bit… achy even when you just… touch it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, that is okay. Not so bad. Just… the left side. That is where it hurts. Everything else is… okay. I think. My bones… they always make little noises. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, those little noises are perfectly normal, Ms. Benites. It just means the joints are moving. Now, I’m going to ask you to bend your knees up one at a time toward your chest. That’s okay if it’s a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it’s too much. Can you bring your right knee up towards your chest?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Ooh… that is little bit hard. But I can do it. Is that… okay? It not sharp pain, just… a pull.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s a little tight, but we’re not seeing anything alarming. Now, can you slowly lower your leg back down?
PATIENT: Yes. There. That is better. A little bit sore, but… okay. It is just old age, I think. I not move so much anymore. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Almost done. Now, I'm going to ask you to sit up slowly when you’re ready, and I'll check your reflexes. Just take your time.
PATIENT: Okay. There. That is… little bit hard. But I am up. My back is… achy now. Do you need me to do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. This just involves a little tap on your knees with this small hammer. It shouldn’t be painful, but let me know if it is uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Ooh! That is… surprising! It made my leg kick. Is that… good? It is not pain, just… a shock. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal. That’s a good reflex response. It means the nerves in your legs are working properly. Alright, Ms. Benites, I’ve finished the physical exam. Based on everything you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you have a muscle strain in your lower back. It’s likely aggravated by lifting and bending, like when you were helping your grandson. It's not serious, but it can be painful and limit your activity. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… sense. A muscle strain. So… it is not my bones? Not something… bad? Lifting… yes, that is probably it. My grandson, he is very heavy! So… what do I do now? Do I need pills? Do I need to… rest?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like it’s anything serious with your bones. Thankfully, a muscle strain is very treatable. For now, I recommend the following: First, rest. Avoid lifting anything heavy or doing activities that aggravate the pain. Second, ice. Apply ice packs to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially in the first few days. Third, over-the-counter pain relief. You can take ibuprofen or naproxen if you're able to tolerate them, following the dosage instructions on the package. If you can't take those, acetaminophen is another option. Fourth, gentle stretching. Once the initial pain subsides, start doing some gentle stretches to help loosen up your back muscles. I can give you a handout with some examples. We can also discuss a referral to physical therapy if your pain doesn't improve after a couple of weeks. Does that sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Rest, ice, pills… stretching. Ibuprofen… I think I have that. Naproxen… maybe my daughter has that. Stretching… yes, I can try that. A handout? That would be good. I forget things so easily. Physical therapy… maybe not yet. I want to try this first. So… if the pain does not get better, then I come back? And maybe we talk about physical therapy then?
DOCTOR: Exactly. If your pain doesn’t improve after a couple of weeks, please come back and see me. We can reassess and discuss a referral to physical therapy at that time. Here’s a handout with some information about lower back pain, including some gentle stretches you can try. It also has some warning signs to look out for, such as numbness, weakness, or loss of bowel control. If you experience any of those, please come see me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This is very helpful. No… I think that is all. Just… thank you for helping me. I feel much better knowing what is wrong. And what I can do. I will try the rest and ice, and I will take the pills. And I will do the stretching, if I can. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. Remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to come back if you have any concerns. Goodbye, and take care of yourself.
