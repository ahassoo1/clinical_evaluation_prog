DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about this tiredness, I suppose. Just… worn out. Seems to come and go, but when it hits, I can barely lift a thing. It’s most peculiar, really. I used to be strong as an ox, you know. Commercial diving isn’t for the weak.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For… a good many years. Before my hip started acting up, that is. And before this… fatigue. It’s not like the tiredness after a long day’s work, though. This is… deeper. More… unsettling. Honestly, I don’t know what is happening to me these days. Everything feels like such a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Deeper,” “unsettling”… I understand. And this has been going on for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. Time… slips away, you know? I'd say… a few months, maybe? It started gradually, just feeling a bit more… sluggish. But it’s gotten worse recently. I had to ask my husband to do the grocery shopping last week! He can’t even lift a proper bag, the poor man. It’s a disgrace, really.
DOCTOR: A few months… Alright. And would you say this tiredness is constant, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely comes and goes. Like… a bad tide, perhaps. Some days I feel… almost normal. I can potter around the house, do a little gardening. But then… wham. Just completely wiped. And it’ll last for… a day, maybe two? Sometimes longer. It's very unpredictable, Doctor. And it's quite frustrating, I must say.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, comes and goes… And are there any specific things that seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… I don't know about triggers. I certainly haven’t been overexerting myself! Though, sometimes after a bit of gardening… it seems worse. But other times I can be out there all day and feel alright. It's very… illogical. It doesn't make any sense, Doctor. Back in my day, things made sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Sometimes these things don’t have a clear cause. Now, besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, well… now that you mention it, my muscles have been… aching. A dull sort of ache, not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. And I’ve been feeling a bit… clumsy, perhaps? Dropped a teacup just yesterday. Never used to do that! I used to have a very steady hand. It's all rather upsetting, really.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches, clumsiness… Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. No chills either. And thankfully, I sleep quite well. Though I do wake up feeling… no more refreshed than when I went to bed, which is a nuisance. But no night sweats, Doctor. I assure you. Everything feels… damp enough as it is, with this humidity.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it's been a bit off, truth be told. I haven't been eating as much as usual. Food just doesn't seem… appealing. My husband tries to tempt me with all sorts of things, but… it's just not the same. A good curry used to perk me right up. Now? It just sits there.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite…Alright. Let’s take a quick look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see you’re currently insured with Medicare. Any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had my appendix out when I was young, that was quite the ordeal. And… my hip replacement a few years back, as I mentioned before. That was successful, though. But aside from that… I’ve always been a healthy woman, really. Sturdy. Commercial diving is a tough profession, you know. You can’t be sickly.
DOCTOR: Right, hip replacement… And any family history of illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Well, my mother lived to a very good age, thankfully. But she had… arthritis, I believe. Badly afflicted in her hands. And my brother… he had some sort of heart trouble. Passed away rather young, unfortunately. A shame, really. He was a good man. But aside from that… not much that I can recall. It wasn’t something we talked about much, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. A small white pill, I take it every morning. And… sometimes I take a bit of ibuprofen for my aches and pains, when they’re particularly bad. But that’s about it, Doctor. I don’t believe in taking too many pills, you know? It weakens the system.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Stand up… yes. It’s a bit difficult these days, to be honest. There. A bit wobbly, aren't I? Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I see. Your reflexes seem a bit sluggish. Balance is… compromised. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No noticeable swelling or redness in the hands. Alright. It appears your muscle strength is reduced. Let's get some blood work done, just to rule a few things out. It could be a number of things, but we need to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, is it? It never ends, does it? Always something to poke and prod at. Very well. I suppose if it will get to the bottom of this… tiredness. What exactly are we looking for, Doctor? And will it be a long wait for the results? I have a bridge club meeting on Thursday, you know.
DOCTOR: We’ll be checking for things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies – things that can cause fatigue and muscle weakness. It's standard procedure. As for the results, the lab usually takes a few days. I'll have the nurse call you with the findings as soon as they're available. Hopefully, we'll have a better idea of what's going on by then. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. And if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call the office.
PATIENT: Oh, “plenty of rest,” you say? Easier said than done when one feels as drained as I do. Very well, Doctor. I shall try. Though I doubt it will make much difference. Hydrated… yes, I’ll drink more water. My husband is always reminding me to do that. Well, I suppose that’s all for now, then? I do hope it isn't something too serious. I have a life to live, you know. Bridge club, gardening… one can’t simply rest it all away.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will schedule your blood work and give you instructions. If anything changes significantly before then, call the office. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A good day to you too, Doctor. I do hope your day is less… draining than mine. Thank you for… trying, at least. .
