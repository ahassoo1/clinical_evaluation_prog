DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia TIPPENS, 76 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. Yes, that's right. Well, I need some papers signed, if you don't mind. It’s for… verification. Health forms, you see. It’s a bit of a bother, honestly, but they need it notarized or something. I just don’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Papers?
PATIENT: Yes, papers. Just a moment… here they are. See? A whole stack of them. They're for… well, it’s about getting some help with things. Old age, you know. I think it’s for a program… or something. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It was a lot of filling things out.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you want me to… sign these forms for you. And you don't even know what they're for?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly. I know they’re for help… getting some assistance. But all the details… the names of the programs, the specifics… it all blurred together after a while. So many questions! I just need someone to say they’re official, you know? A notary, or a doctor… someone they’ll believe. Is that… alright? I can try to explain more, but I might get confused.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m a doctor, not a rubber stamp. I need to know what I'm signing. What kind of assistance are you applying for?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it was… something about help with the house. Repairs, mostly. And… some help with meals, maybe? I’m not very good at cooking anymore. And… I think there was something about help with getting around? It’s all very confusing! The lady at the office… she explained it all, but I just… I don’t remember the names of the programs. She said it was a state thing, I think? Is this a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s a problem when someone asks a doctor to sign paperwork they don't understand for programs they can’t even name. You’re 76 years old, and you’re applying for state assistance, and you don’t know what you’re signing up for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I just needed help. I thought a doctor signing it would… make it easier. I didn't mean to cause any trouble! I’m just… a bit overwhelmed, that’s all. I thought it was a simple thing, getting a signature. I’m not very good with paperwork, never have been. Is there someone else I could ask? Perhaps a social worker? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm going to ask you a few questions. We need to establish a basic medical history here, just to be on the safe side before I even consider signing anything. It’s standard practice. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… well. Let’s see… my arthritis, of course. It’s in my hands and knees, makes it hard to get around. And… my blood pressure, it gets a bit high sometimes. I take a little pill for that. And… I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered. Oh! And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that’s why I have these glasses. Is that enough? I’m probably forgetting something. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Alright. Medications?
PATIENT: Just the one, for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A little white pill. I take one every morning with my breakfast. That’s it, really. Nothing else. Are we getting closer to the signing? I really need to get home, if you don't mind. My neighbor is expecting me.
DOCTOR: "Getting closer to the signing?
PATIENT: Oh… well, yes. I apologize. I didn’t mean to rush you. It's just… I’ve been waiting a long time for this assistance, and I thought having the forms signed would be the last step. I’m just… anxious to get it sorted out. But please, take your time. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I do. Penicillin! I'm terribly allergic to it. I broke out in a rash, years ago. It was awful. The doctor said never, ever take it. And… I think I’m a little sensitive to codeine, it makes me feel very sick. I don't think I have any others. Nothing major, anyway. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… that’s a hard one. My mother, she had… heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was young. My father, he worked in the fields. He was very healthy, as far as I know. My brother, he had… diabetes, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much. We weren’t very close. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I’m not very good at remembering things like that. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It's always important. Look, I need to know what I’m potentially signing off on here. You’re requesting assistance for… what, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, the lady at the office said it was for… home care. Help with cleaning and… things. And meal delivery. Because I'm… getting older, you see. It's hard to do everything myself anymore. And… help with getting to doctor's appointments. My neighbor drives me sometimes, but it’s a burden, I think. And… I think there was something about help with paying for medications? I'm just trying to stay independent, that's all. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. I just need a little help, that's all.
DOCTOR: So you want state assistance to clean your house, deliver meals, drive you to appointments and pay for your medication… and you expect me to sign off on these forms without a proper assessment?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, that’s not what I meant! I thought… I thought you would just be verifying that I was… eligible, or something. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. I just… I filled out all the paperwork, and they said I needed a doctor’s signature. I didn’t realize it was so complicated! I'm sorry. I should have asked more questions. I just… I really need this help. Is there anything… anything I can do to make it easier?
DOCTOR: Look, I'm going to refer you to a social worker. They can assess your needs and determine your eligibility for assistance. They're equipped to handle this, and frankly, it's beyond the scope of a routine appointment. Here. Make an appointment with them as soon as possible. They’ll sort everything out. And I will not be signing those forms.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s… alright. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if you can't sign the papers. I hope the social worker can help. Have a good day, Doctor Billman. .
