DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, Ms. Cantoran, you're here today… why don’t you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I'm tired. Really tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. It just… tastes good sometimes. Don’t look at me like that. It's not like I'm choosing this, it just happens. I don’t even know why. And it's getting worse, okay? I just want to know what's wrong with me so I can get out of here.
DOCTOR: Right. Tired… and you consume… soil. Okay. And this is a recent development, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: A while. A long while, now that I think about it. Years, maybe? Honestly, time… it all blurs together. It’s just been… more lately. More of a craving, I guess. Like, I need it. Don’t ask me why, I told you, I don't know. It’s embarrassing, alright? I don’t go around bragging about eating dirt. What kind of question is this anyway? Is it gonna help me or not?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Cantoran, I'm trying to get a history here. It's called pica, and it can be related to… deficiencies. Iron, zinc, things like that. You said more recently… can you quantify that?
PATIENT: Deficiencies? Look, I eat regular food. I'm not… deficient. I cook, I clean, I work. I’m a CNC programmer, I need to be sharp! I don't go around, you know, munching on rocks all day. And "quantify?" What does that even mean? More than last month, okay? More than last week. Is that good enough for you? I just feel… weaker, and I eat more dirt. It's a simple problem, isn't it? Why are you making it so complicated?
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're eating more dirt and feeling weaker. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I'm tired, I already told you that. And… my stomach feels funny sometimes. Not always, but… bloated, I guess. And I get headaches. A lot of headaches. Look, I work with machines all day, alright? It’s loud, it’s stressful. Probably just that. I don’t need a list of every little ache and pain, I just want to know what's making me tired. Is it the dirt? Is that what you’re trying to figure out?
DOCTOR: Bloated stomach, headaches… Okay. Do you have any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? What are you asking me, if I'm dying? No, I can breathe just fine! Look, I walk to the store, I climb stairs, I… I do things. I'm not a fragile flower. Are you always this… thorough? It’s just dirt, alright? Maybe I just need more vitamins. I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. What's this even for?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I need to rule things out. It’s called due diligence. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Seriously? Now you want to talk about… that? Look, I'm not discussing that with you. I came here because I'm tired and I eat dirt, not for a personal medical examination! I’m a respectable woman. I’ll just… I’ll just go home. This is ridiculous. Are you even listening to me? I'm wasting my whole day here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, fine. Look, I'm ordering some basic blood work. Iron, zinc, complete blood count. We’ll see what comes back. Consider a referral to a gastroenterologist if the symptoms persist. And honestly, Ms. Cantoran, you really should try to stop consuming soil. It’s… unhygienic. Here's the lab slip. Next!
