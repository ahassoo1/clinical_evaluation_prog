DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it concerns planning for the future, I suppose. I was advised to come speak with someone about…documents. About what happens if I’m unable to make decisions for myself. Something about an Advance Directive, or a POLST form, perhaps? I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be, and I don’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Advance care planning. Yes, a sensible thing to consider. It’s often easier to discuss these matters before a crisis arises. You're right to be proactive. Let's start with the basics. When you say "unable to make decisions," what specifically are you concerned about?
PATIENT: That’s a very good point, Doctor. It’s…difficult to articulate. Just…a general feeling of wanting to be prepared. I suppose if something were to happen where I was…seriously ill, or injured, and couldn't communicate my wishes. Or if a situation arose where decisions needed to be made quickly. I believe my ex-husband mentioned something about…what treatments I would or wouldn’t want. But honestly, the details are quite blurry. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Buoniconti. These things are unsettling to think about. It's common to feel overwhelmed. So, we're talking about establishing your wishes for medical care should you become incapacitated. Let's clarify the tools available. An Advance Directive is a broad document outlining your preferences, while a POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order. Do you have any existing documentation regarding these, or is this a completely new process?
PATIENT: I…believe it’s a completely new process, Doctor. I’ve never dealt with anything like this before. My ex-husband briefly mentioned something about a lawyer drawing up papers once, a long time ago, but I don’t believe anything ever came of it. I certainly don’t have any copies of anything. I don't even recall which lawyer he spoke with, truthfully. I’m rather disorganized, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Disorganized is…understandable. It's not uncommon. Alright. It seems we'll be starting from scratch then. Before we delve into the specifics of Advance Directives and POLST forms, let's establish a baseline understanding of your general health. I'll need to review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do review my history. Let me see… I believe I have mild hypertension, managed with medication. And…I had a rather severe bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but I’ve recovered fully, I think. Aside from that, nothing significant comes to mind. I used to have quite terrible migraines, but those have lessened considerably in recent years. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti, that’s exactly the sort of thing I need to know. Hypertension is important, as is the history of pneumonia. We'll need to document the medication you're taking for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s…difficult. I believe it’s a small white pill. My usual pharmacist handles the refills, so I don’t often pay close attention to the name. It’s… Lisinopril, perhaps? Or something similar sounding? I take one pill each morning, I believe 10 milligrams. But I truly apologize for my uncertainty, Doctor. I rely heavily on my pharmacist to ensure I have the correct medication.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. We will verify this with your pharmacy. It’s crucial to have accurate information. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t believe so, Doctor. I’ve never experienced any severe reactions to anything. A slight itchiness with certain fabrics, perhaps, but nothing that would require medical attention. I’m generally quite…robust, I suppose. But if I were to develop an allergy, I’m unsure I’d even recognize it immediately. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies. "Robust" is… reassuring, though vigilance is still required. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never been inclined towards any of those things. I maintain a very…temperate lifestyle. I enjoy tea, occasionally a small glass of wine with dinner, but nothing excessive. And I certainly don’t smoke. My health is important to me, even if my memory is… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, regarding family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family…we weren’t close. I didn’t spend much time with them, particularly as I grew older. My mother…she passed away when I was young. I believe she had some sort of…cardiac issue, but the details are very vague. My father…I don't recall him having any significant illnesses. I’m afraid I can’t offer much assistance on that front. It’s…a sensitive subject, and my recollections are quite fragmented.
DOCTOR: Limited family history available. Understandable. Now, Ms. Buoniconti, to get a clearer picture of your current health status, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Please, proceed as you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Just…please be gentle. My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but not alarming. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Neurological examination is grossly normal. Overall physical exam is within normal limits, though blood pressure warrants monitoring.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness. The blood pressure is likely due to stress, I suppose. I do worry about…everything. But I appreciate you confirming that everything else appears to be in order. What are the next steps, Doctor? Should we discuss these Advance Directives and POLST forms now? Or is there anything else you require from me?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s address the Advance Directives and POLST forms. These documents are legally binding, so it’s crucial to understand their implications. An Advance Directive allows you to specify your wishes regarding medical treatment, and designate a healthcare proxy – someone to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so yourself. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a specific medical order outlining your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. Do you have any thoughts on who you would want to designate as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… that is a difficult question, Doctor. My ex-husband and I…we don’t maintain a close relationship. He wouldn’t be suitable. I don’t have any close family, as I mentioned. And most of my acquaintances are…simply that – acquaintances. I hadn’t truly considered this. It’s… isolating, to be honest. I suppose… perhaps my solicitor? He handles my financial affairs, and he’s a reasonable man. I don’t know if that’s appropriate, though. I truly haven’t given this enough thought.
DOCTOR: Your solicitor could be a viable option, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s important to choose someone you trust implicitly and who understands your values. We can certainly discuss the legal implications of this decision. However, it’s crucial to ensure they’re willing and able to fulfill this role. Before we proceed with formal documentation, I recommend discussing this with your solicitor to confirm their availability and willingness. We should also consider the importance of a living will, which outlines your specific wishes regarding end-of-life care. Do you have any preliminary thoughts on your preferences in that regard?
PATIENT: A living will… that sounds… daunting, Doctor. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. I wouldn’t want to be a burden on anyone. And I certainly wouldn’t want to be in constant pain. But beyond that… I haven’t given it much thought. It’s…difficult to contemplate, to be honest. I’m not afraid of death, per se, but I don’t want to prolong suffering needlessly. Perhaps… a simple, dignified exit? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconti, that is entirely possible. A simple, dignified exit is a perfectly reasonable wish, and we can certainly document that in your Advance Directive. We will include a statement outlining your preference for comfort care only in the event of a terminal illness with no reasonable prospect of recovery. However, it’s important to understand that this doesn't necessarily preclude all medical intervention. It simply prioritizes your comfort and quality of life. Before we proceed further, I recommend reviewing some informational materials on Advance Directives and POLST forms. I have some pamphlets here, and there are also resources available online. I also strongly suggest consulting with your solicitor to discuss the legal implications of these documents and ensure they align with your wishes. Do you have any immediate questions before I provide you with these resources?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Perhaps… I'll need time to process everything. It’s a great deal to consider. The pamphlets and the suggestion to speak with my solicitor are… helpful. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate your guidance in this matter. I believe that will be all for today, Doctor. Unless you have anything else you require from me?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. Take your time. There’s no need to rush. I’ll have the nurse bring you the informational pamphlets and a list of local solicitors specializing in estate planning. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day.
