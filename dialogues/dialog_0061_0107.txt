DOCTOR: “Bula vinaka, Philipp. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart, it feels… fast sometimes. Not always, but when it does, it’s like… flapping. Like a bird, maybe? It’s been happening for… I think a few weeks now. Maybe a month? I don't know exactly.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a few weeks to a month of feeling like your heart is racing or flapping, you said. That sounds a little unsettling. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? It’s hard to say. Not when I’m doing… hard work. When I’m resting, maybe? Sometimes when I watch TV. Or… just sitting. It doesn’t feel like I do anything to make it happen. It just… starts. Not always after eating, or before bed… I really don’t know. It's random. Sorry.
DOCTOR: “No, that’s alright, it is helpful to know it seems to happen at rest and doesn’t have a clear trigger. And it’s okay if it’s hard to pinpoint. How long does it usually last when it happens?
PATIENT: Maybe… five minutes? Sometimes less. Maybe ten, but not often. It stops on its own. I just… feel it, and then it goes away. It doesn’t hurt, just… strange. Like someone is shaking my chest, but inside. Then… normal again.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so it comes on suddenly, lasts a few minutes, and then resolves on its own. And you don’t have any chest pain with it, just this sensation of a fluttering or shaking inside. Have you noticed anything else happening when it starts?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And maybe a little short of breath. Like I can’t get enough air, but not bad shortness of breath. Just… like my lungs are a little tight. Does that make sense? It’s all at the same time as the fast heart.
DOCTOR: “Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dizziness and a little shortness of breath along with the fast heart rate. Okay. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new. I’ve been healthy, I think. I work with the chemicals, but I always wear the safety things. Never sick, never had heart problems before. My father… he had problems with his stomach, but not with his heart. I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: “Okay, good to know this is a new experience for you and that you take precautions at work. And your father had stomach issues, but not heart problems. Let's talk about some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. No problems with medicine either. I take nothing normally, unless I get a headache, then I take… the white pills. I don’t remember the name. Just the little white ones. They work good.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no known allergies and you only take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. That’s helpful. And we can talk about those white pills later if you like. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. A lot. Chemical plant. I come home, I eat with my wife, we watch TV. Sometimes we visit family. I don’t… drink much. Maybe one beer on the weekend. I don't smoke. And I try to walk a little bit when the weather is nice. Normal life, I think.
DOCTOR: “Okay, so you work at a chemical plant, spend time with your wife, and try to stay active when you can. That sounds pretty healthy overall. Just to be thorough, do you have any anxiety or stress that you’ve been dealing with lately?
PATIENT: Stress? Hmm… work is… busy sometimes. But I don’t worry about it much. My wife… she worries more than me. But no, I don’t think so. I sleep okay. I don’t have bad dreams. I feel… okay. I don’t feel… scared or anything. Just tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s good to know. No significant anxiety or stress. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I hope it’s nothing bad. My wife will be worried if I go to the hospital. She always worries.
DOCTOR: “We’re just gathering information right now, Philipp. Let’s start with your blood pressure.” “Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart sounds a bit fast, around 90 beats per minute, and your rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear. I’m going to feel your pulse in both your wrists and ankles now.” “Pulses are good and regular in all extremities. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to order a few tests. We'll do an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart, a blood test to check your thyroid function and electrolytes, and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. EKG, blood test… whatever you think is best. But… what does it mean? Is my heart… broken? My wife… she will be very upset. Is it serious? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: “Okay, let’s take a deep breath. It doesn’t sound like your heart is ‘broken’ at all. An EKG will simply give us a picture of your heart’s electrical activity, and the blood test will help us rule out some common causes of a fast heart rate. Elevated blood pressure can contribute to symptoms like this, so that's important to monitor. It’s important to remember that many things can cause a fast heart rate, and it doesn’t always mean there’s something seriously wrong. We're doing these tests to get more information so we can determine the cause and make sure you’re feeling better. I'm going to have the nurse draw blood and get you hooked up to the EKG machine. It won't take long. While we wait for the results, is there anything else you think might be relevant, or any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I just… sometimes I feel a little tired. But I work hard. Maybe it's just the work. And… my wife says I snore. Loudly. She sleeps in the other room sometimes because of the snoring. But I don’t think that has anything to do with my heart. I hope not.
DOCTOR: “Okay, tiredness and snoring. Snoring can sometimes be related to underlying medical conditions, so it’s good you mentioned it. We’ll keep that in mind. Let's see what the tests tell us first. "The nurse will be in shortly to get started. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to relax, and please let me or the nurse know if you feel any chest pain, severe dizziness, or shortness of breath.”
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will try to relax. My wife will be glad you are looking into this. She worries too much. I hope it's nothing serious. I just want to go home and watch TV with her.
