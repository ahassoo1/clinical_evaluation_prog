DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Neppl, you say? Never heard of that name before. Well, it’s about… well, it’s a delicate matter, really. Let’s just say I saw something in the… the toilet this morning that didn’t sit right. Blood, you see. Blood in my stool. Not a pretty sight for an old fella like me. I’ve lived a long life, flown a lot of miles, and I don't appreciate being reminded of my… fragility.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Seeing blood in the stool is certainly concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. It’s quite alright that you haven’t heard of my name before; I recently joined the practice. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It was… red. Obviously. Blood is red, Doctor. Is this some kind of trick question? I’m not an artist, I fly airplanes. Was it bright red? Dark red? I don't know! It was just… blood. A fair amount, too. More than a little dab. Enough to make a man stop and think, you know? And frankly, I’ve always been a bit particular about cleanliness. It was rather… upsetting.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Rowbottom – it is a bit of a detailed question, and I apologize if it seems insensitive. The color and consistency of the blood can help me pinpoint the source. Bright red blood usually indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, whereas darker blood may suggest bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. You mentioned a “fair amount”—would you estimate roughly how much?
PATIENT: Higher up? Digestive tract? Now you’re just talking nonsense, Doctor. I just told you, I'm not a doctor, I don't know about tracts! And I certainly didn’t bring a measuring cup into the bathroom with me! A “fair amount” is… well, it was enough to turn the water pinkish, if that helps your fancy medical mind. More than a drop, certainly. Less than… well, less than if I'd been stabbed, I suppose. Honestly, I’ve seen less disturbing things on a flight.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. Pinkish water gives me a better sense. Now, besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I'm an old man. Things change. That’s what happens when you get to my age. But… let me think. I suppose… it’s been a bit looser than usual, if you want to get down to specifics. And… harder to… well, to complete the business, if you follow me. Takes a bit longer, requires a bit more… effort. Is that what you want to know? Frankly, I find this line of questioning rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if my questions feel invasive. I assure you, I’m only trying to gather as much information as possible to determine the cause of the bleeding and ensure you receive the best possible care. The change in consistency and the difficulty you’ve described are important details. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or cramping along with these changes?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Sometimes. A bit of a rumble, mostly. Old age aches, you know? Everything aches when you get to be eighty-eight. But nothing… sharp. Nothing that would send me to the hospital. Just… discomfort. A general feeling of… things not being quite right. Honestly, Doctor, I've flown through typhoons with less discomfort. And I've eaten worse airline food, if that gives you any perspective.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… detailed descriptions, Mr. Rowbottom. They are quite helpful. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… my trousers have been a bit looser around the waist, but I figured that was just me… shrinking. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, if that’s what you’re asking. I used to be a pretty good weight for my height, but… well, I haven’t paid much attention to it lately. I’ve been more concerned with keeping my hands steady on the controls, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick rectal exam. The rectal exam is important for identifying the source of the bleeding. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. You’re telling me you want to… poke around down there? After asking all these personal questions? I’ve lived eighty-eight years without anyone poking around down there, and I’d like to keep it that way, thank you very much. I’m a pilot, Doctor, not some… some specimen. I’m not sure I appreciate this line of questioning or your proposed… examination. I think I’ll just stick to flying, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. A rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating rectal bleeding, and it’s the most reliable way to determine the source of the bleeding and rule out more serious conditions. It’s a quick procedure, and I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. However, I completely respect your decision. If you are unwilling to undergo the exam, I can order some laboratory tests – a complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood – but it will make it more difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Given your age and the fact that you haven't had a thorough medical workup recently, I strongly recommend at least considering these tests. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests… hmm. Tests I can understand. No poking around, no… invasive procedures. Just… samples. I suppose I can agree to tests. But I want the results explained to me in plain English, Doctor. None of your fancy medical jargon. And I want them quickly. I have a flight to catch, you know. Can you do that for me? And no guarantees about the trousers. They're already a bit loose, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I can certainly order the tests and explain the results to you in plain English. We’ll schedule them for as quickly as possible. I'll order a complete blood count, which will tell us if you’re anemic and give us clues about the bleeding, and a fecal occult blood test, which detects hidden blood in your stool. The lab results typically take a few days. I will contact you as soon as they are available, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or are you currently taking any prescriptions?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things on flights – airline meals, questionable peanuts, whatever they give you in first class. I’ve survived it all. As for prescriptions… no. Never been one for pills. I prefer a good strong cup of coffee, if you must know. And maybe a whiskey, on occasion. But no regular medications. I'm a fairly hardy specimen, all things considered. And I trust my body, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. No known allergies, no regular medications. That’s good to know. I’ll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for the tests. To recap, we’re going to run a complete blood count and a fecal occult blood test to investigate the source of the bleeding. I'll contact you as soon as the results are available. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude the consultation today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… get the tests done quickly, and explain them in English. And no poking around, thank you very much. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. A pilot can't be seen hobbling around with… well, never mind. Just get the tests done. And try to find out why my trousers are getting so loose. That’s a mystery worth solving, if you ask me. .
