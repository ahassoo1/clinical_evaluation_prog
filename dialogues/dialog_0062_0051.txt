DOCTOR: Hi Darl, welcome! I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s… lovely to meet you too. Doctor… DeCosta, was it? Yes. Well, my goodness, time slips away, doesn’t it? I think… I need to know my blood type. My son, he said it would be good to have that written down, just in case. Though why, I couldn’t rightly tell you. Old age, you know. Things…fade.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It's a very sensible idea to have your blood type documented, even if it's just for peace of mind. And things do fade, don't they?
PATIENT: They certainly do! I used to be so good with numbers… working on those big cranes, you had to be. Riggers, that was my trade. Though… it was a long time ago now. My husband, bless his soul, he was a carpenter. A good man. But… the blood type. Is that…difficult to find out?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It’s a very simple blood test. We can get that done right here in the clinic today. Before we do that though, just to make sure I have a complete picture, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of, dear. I used to take something for my… the water on my knees, but that was years ago. Nothing comes to mind… really. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Unless… dust? I do cough a bit when I’m cleaning. Is that an allergy? I wouldn’t call it a bad allergy, mind you. Just a little tickle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A little tickle with dust isn't usually a serious allergy, but we can certainly make a note of it. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… sometimes I take something for my… well, for being a little… forgetful, you know? My daughter bought it for me. A little pink pill. But I don’t take it every day. Only when I really… can’t remember things. And… I think that’s all. Honestly, I’m not much for taking pills. They don't agree with me. What was that pill called? Oh dear... It's on the tip of my tongue...
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it's perfectly alright if you don't remember the name. It's very common to forget those things. We can look it up if you'd like, or we can just focus on getting the blood type test done today. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh my. Past medical history… That’s a long one. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. Silly thing to do, really. And… well, my knees, as I mentioned. They’ve been giving me trouble for years. Old age, you know? Arthritis, I think the doctor said. But… nothing serious. I’ve always been a healthy woman, all things considered. I’ve never had to spend much time in the hospital. I’m thankful for that. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient over the years! Just to clarify about the arthritis, have you been officially diagnosed with a specific type of arthritis, and if so, do you know which one?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. I went to a doctor… years ago. He said something about… wear and tear. And inflammation. He gave me some cream and some pills. I think he said… osteoarthritis? Or was it rheumatoid? They all sound so similar, don’t they? I don’t recall the exact name, truthfully. I just know my knees ache when it’s cold or damp. And I try to avoid climbing too many stairs. That’s all I remember. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t pay much attention to the details. I just wanted something to make the pain go away.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. "Wear and tear" arthritis, or osteoarthritis, is the most common type, so that's a likely possibility. Do you experience any pain in other joints besides your knees?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my hands ache a little, especially in the morning. But I put that down to the gardening. I enjoy puttering around in the garden, you see. Roses are my favourite. But no, not really any bad pain in other joints. Just a little stiffness now and then. Nothing worth mentioning, I don't think. Compared to my knees, it's nothing at all. Is this… important? Are you worried about something?
DOCTOR: It’s good to get a full picture, Darl. A little stiffness in your hands is worth noting, especially with the knee pain. It just helps me understand what's going on. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tricky one. My mother… she lived to a good age, nearly ninety. But she always had a weak heart. I think she had… high blood pressure? And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. But he died young, in a storm. I don't recall any major illnesses in his family. My brother… he had diabetes, later in life. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, I think she had cancer. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. Everyone always just…died. You know? It was the way things were. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering these things… it all blends together after a while.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It sounds like there's a history of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer in your family. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Well, these days it’s rather quiet. I live alone, you see. My husband passed away many years ago. I enjoy gardening, as I mentioned. And reading. I love a good mystery novel. I try to eat healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I used to walk more, but my knees… well, they don't allow for much walking these days. I try to stay active, but it's not as easy as it used to be. I suppose that's all there is to it. A simple life. A quiet life. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Darl. Staying active and enjoying gardening is wonderful. And finally, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. No, I don’t think so. As I said before, I don’t recall any serious allergies. A little tickle with dust, but nothing more. And no allergies to foods. I eat everything. I used to be careful with shellfish, but that was years ago. I haven’t had any problems for a very long time. Honestly, I’m a pretty hardy woman. I’ve never been one to be bothered by allergies. I think that’s it. Do you think I've told you everything? I’m always afraid I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: No, Darl, you've told me quite a lot! It sounds like you've been very thorough. Okay, well, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Just… be gentle with my knees, if you would. They’re a bit… sensitive. And don’t mind if I ask questions. I always like to know what’s going on. It keeps me calm, you see. A little bit of information goes a long way. Are you ready?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! I'll be as gentle as possible, and please do ask any questions you have. It’s important you understand everything. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and a little bit of nervousness during the exam. Your pulse is 72, regular. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to take a look at your knees. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… Yes. That’s a bit… uncomfortable. But I’m alright. Just… be careful. They do creak a bit. And they’re always a little stiff in the morning. I suppose that’s just old age. What are you looking for, dear? Is it something serious? I hope it’s not arthritis. I try not to think about it too much, you see. It just…depresses me.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just feeling around to see if there's any swelling or tenderness. There is some mild crepitus – that’s the cracking sound you mentioned – which is common with osteoarthritis. There's a slight limitation in your range of motion, particularly with extension – straightening your leg fully. I don't feel any significant swelling or warmth, which is reassuring. You do have some mild tenderness along the joint line on both sides. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, the exam suggests some mild to moderate osteoarthritis in both knees, consistent with your symptoms. It doesn’t appear to be anything more acute at this time. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Osteo…arthritis. Yes. That’s what I was afraid of. Mild to moderate… well, I suppose that’s not too bad, is it? My knees have been bothering me for years, so it’s not exactly a surprise. It’s just… discouraging, you know? I try to stay active, but it’s difficult. And I don’t want to become… immobile. Is there anything I can do about it? Any exercises? Any cream? Any pills? Oh, and I forgot to ask… will it get worse? Will I need a… a surgery? I’m afraid of surgery, dear. Very afraid.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Darl. Let's address them one by one. First, regarding exercises, physical therapy can be incredibly helpful to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. I can write you a referral to a physical therapist. There are also some simple exercises you can do at home, like gentle leg extensions and hamstring curls. As for creams, topical pain relievers containing capsaicin or salicylates can provide some temporary relief. We can discuss those options as well. And regarding pills, over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage the pain, but we need to be careful about long-term use, especially given your age. Now, regarding whether it will get worse, osteoarthritis is a progressive condition, which means it can worsen over time. However, the rate of progression varies from person to person. With appropriate management – physical therapy, exercise, and pain control – we can often slow down the progression and manage your symptoms effectively. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases that don't respond to conservative treatment. At this point, it’s not something we need to consider. Does that help to alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That does help. Very much so. No surgery right away… that’s good. Physical therapy… I suppose I can try that. I always liked a good massage, so maybe that will be similar. And the cream… yes, I can try the cream. I don’t want to take too many pills, you see. I don’t like the way they make me feel. So, no surgery… exercises… and cream. And I’ll try to be careful with my knees. Is that all? Now, about that blood type… I completely forgot in all the excitement! Are we going to do that now? I’d like to have that written down, just in case. My son… he’s always so worried. And I don't want to worry him unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Darl. You've got it. No surgery at this time. Exercises, cream, and careful management of your knees. And we’ll get that blood type test done now. This will only take a few minutes. We'll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a couple of days. I’ll have the nurse give you a call with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral for physical therapy, and I’ll also give you a list of over-the-counter creams and pain relievers that are safe for you to use. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, dear. That sounds wonderful. Physical therapy… and the list. My son will be so relieved to know we’re getting everything sorted out. He worries so much. Bless his heart. And… what happens if it’s a… a rare blood type? Will they have to… special order something? Oh, dear. I’m getting anxious again. I always worry about these things. I suppose I should have asked my mother about it when I had the chance… but now it’s too late. Just… let me know if there’s anything I need to worry about. I trust your judgement, dear. You seem very competent. And you’re very kind. Thank you for taking such good care of me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Darl. It's my pleasure. Regarding a rare blood type, it's unlikely, but if you were to have a rare blood type, yes, it might take a little longer to find a match if you ever needed a transfusion. However, the blood bank has systems in place to handle those situations, and they are very efficient at finding compatible donors. So there's really no need to worry about that at this time. We'll just get the results first and then we can discuss any further steps if necessary. Here you go. All done. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the referral and the list. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything so patiently. And you’ve reassured me. That’s the most important thing. Oh, wait! One last thing… what about my knees? Should I be using a brace? Or a cane? My son keeps suggesting things… and I don’t want to start using things I don’t need. He means well, but he worries so much. And… thank you again. For everything. You’ve been a lifesaver. I feel much better now. Really. I think I’ll go home and have a nice cup of tea. And maybe take a little nap. You’ve exhausted me with all the worrying! But it’s a good kind of exhausted.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. I'm glad I could help alleviate your concerns. Regarding a brace or cane, at this stage, it's not necessary. A brace or cane can sometimes be helpful for more severe cases, but with your mild to moderate osteoarthritis, it's best to focus on strengthening exercises and managing your pain with the other methods we discussed. It’s good your son cares so much, but sometimes well-intentioned advice can be a bit overwhelming. We can discuss it further if you find his suggestions become too much. You go home and enjoy that cup of tea and a nap. You deserve it! It was a pleasure meeting you, Darl. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. And… thank you for being so kind. It’s a comfort to know there are still good people in the world. Goodbye, dear. And… thank you again. You've been a lifesaver.
