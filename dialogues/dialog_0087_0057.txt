DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re here today with our clinic. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well... it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see someone about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds… concerning. To clarify, Chellsea, were you recently diagnosed with cancer, or is this related to a family history of cancer?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… I was diagnosed. It was… a few months ago now, I think. Time is… hard to keep track of these days. It's in my… well, the doctor who told me said it was in my chest. I don’t really understand much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent cancer diagnosis in the chest… that’s a lot to process, and it’s perfectly alright that you don’t have all the details right now. We'll work through this together. Just to be precise, do you recall the specific type of cancer you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the type? No, not really. They said a lot of big words… something about cells, I think. And… lung cancer, maybe? But they also said it could be something else because of where it started. I honestly can’t remember. It was a very busy day, and I was… scared. I just know it’s bad.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be overwhelmed and not remember everything, especially when receiving difficult news. I’m accessing your records now, and hopefully we can find more information there. While I pull that up, can you tell me who diagnosed you and where?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Doctor Elroy. He was at… City General, I believe. It was a very large hospital. A few towns over. He’s the one who sent me here, actually. He said you might be able to explain things better.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see records from Dr. Elroy at City General… and it appears the preliminary diagnosis was a mediastinal germ cell tumor. That’s a type of cancer that can occur in the chest, and explains why it wasn’t immediately classified as typical lung cancer. Do you mind if I ask a few more questions about your symptoms?
PATIENT: A… mediastinal germ… I don’t even know how to say that. That sounds very complicated. Symptoms… yes, I suppose. What would you like to know? I've been… tired a lot. And I cough sometimes. It doesn’t really hurt, just… there. But those things could be anything, I guess.
DOCTOR: It is complicated, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Fatigue and a cough are certainly things we need to discuss. When did you first notice the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. It didn't really come on suddenly. It was just… gradual. Maybe around… January? I started feeling more tired than usual. I thought it was just the winter, honestly. Everything feels harder when it's cold. But it didn't go away, even when it got warmer. I just kept getting more and more tired. It's hard to do much these days. Even walking to the store feels like a big effort.
DOCTOR: January… so several months now. And has the cough been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days it’s hardly there, just a little tickle in my throat. Other days… like when I lie down, it’s worse. It doesn’t hurt, but it’s… annoying. And sometimes I feel a bit… breathless when I cough. But not always. It's hard to explain. It feels different every day.
DOCTOR: That variability is important information. Have you noticed any other symptoms, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. No… not really. I lost a bit of weight, maybe? But I haven't been eating much, so that makes sense. Oh! And sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, exactly, but… like something is pressing on it. That happens mostly at night, when I try to sleep. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s certainly important. Weight loss and the chest tightness are things we need to investigate further. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my medical history… It's not very interesting. I haven’t really been sick much. Just the usual childhood things, I suppose. I had the measles once, and chickenpox. But nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized before, except for… when I had my daughter. But that was many years ago. I don’t really remember much about it. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries other than the delivery of your daughter?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Not at all. I always try to stay healthy. That's why all this is so… upsetting. I don't understand how this could happen. I eat well, I try to exercise… I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink. I just… I don't understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Chellsea. It’s unsettling when something like this happens, especially when you take good care of yourself. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… My mother had… diabetes, I believe. And her mother had… arthritis, very bad arthritis in her hands. My father… he had heart problems. He died when I was young. I don’t really know much about his medical history. It wasn't really talked about much. As far as cancer… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. But my family isn’t very big, and we don’t see each other very often. So… I couldn’t really say for sure.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease… noted. And no known family history of cancer. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies. None at all. I've never had a reaction to anything. I take vitamins sometimes, but that's it. Just a multivitamin. And… that's all. I really don't take much in the way of medicine. I always try to stay healthy. I know, I keep saying that. But it's true. I really don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Chellsea. It's good to know you're not currently taking any medications besides a multivitamin. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly alright. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, do whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s happening. And what we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Please, if you would, have a seat on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your lungs and heart. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that alright? I'm a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Okay. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the left side, and a slight wheeze. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Chest is tender to palpation on the left side, but no masses are palpable. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. I'm also noticing some mild swelling in your left supraclavicular lymph node. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Oh dear… what does all that mean? Diminished sounds… swelling… that doesn't sound very good, does it? Is it… bad? Please, be honest with me, Doctor. I can handle it. I just need to know.
DOCTOR: It's reasonable to be concerned, Chellsea. These findings – the diminished breath sounds, the wheezing, the tenderness, and the swelling in your lymph node – are consistent with what we might expect with a mediastinal mass. The preliminary diagnosis of a mediastinal germ cell tumor, combined with these physical findings, suggests we need to investigate further to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease. It doesn’t automatically mean it’s severe, but it does mean we need to act quickly. We'll need to order some imaging studies, specifically a chest CT scan with contrast, and likely a PET scan as well. We may also need a biopsy to confirm the type of tumor.
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a… PET scan? A biopsy? That sounds… frightening. What will those scans show? And what happens during a biopsy? Will it hurt? I… I don't think I'm prepared for all this. I thought I was just coming in for a check-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in. Let me explain. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your chest. It will help us see the size and location of any potential mass, and whether it’s affecting any surrounding structures. A PET scan, which stands for Positron Emission Tomography, helps us see how active the cells are. It can help us determine if there is any spread of disease. As for a biopsy, it involves taking a small sample of tissue from the mass and examining it under a microscope to confirm the type of tumor. It's typically done with a needle, guided by imaging, and is performed under local anesthesia to minimize discomfort. There will be some pressure and mild discomfort, but we’ll do everything we can to make it as comfortable as possible. Before we order those tests, do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Local anesthesia… That sounds better. But… what if it is cancer that has spread? What are the… the treatments? I've heard terrible things. And… what about my daughter? I don't want to leave her. Will I… will I be able to take care of her?
DOCTOR: It's alright to be scared, Chellsea. Those are very valid concerns. Let’s address them one at a time. If the imaging confirms spread, treatment options depend on the specific type of tumor, how far it’s spread, and your overall health. Treatments can include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and potentially surgery. The goal is always to eliminate or control the cancer and improve your quality of life. As for your daughter, that’s incredibly important. We’ll work with you to create a treatment plan that minimizes disruption to your life as much as possible. Many patients are able to continue their daily activities, including caring for their families, during treatment. And we have resources available to help support you and your daughter throughout this process. Before we move forward with ordering the imaging, I'd like to discuss a referral to an oncologist – a cancer specialist – who can guide you through the treatment process. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An oncologist… Yes, please. That sounds… helpful. Someone who knows all about this… I need someone who understands. I… I don't want to do this alone. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being so patient. I'm still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing what to expect. What happens next?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It's my job to support you through this. What happens next is I'll send a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly regarded oncologist at City General – she’s familiar with cases like yours. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I'll order the chest CT scan with contrast and the PET scan. You’ll receive instructions from the radiology department on how to prepare for those tests. I’ll also send a copy of your records to Dr. Sharma so she has all the information she needs. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when should I expect to hear from Dr. Sharma's office? And… how long will it take to get the results of the scans? I know you can’t predict the future, but… just a rough estimate would be helpful. I just want to… prepare myself.
DOCTOR: Generally, you can expect to hear from Dr. Sharma’s office within 3-5 business days to schedule an appointment. As for the scan results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the images. Once the results are available, I’ll review them with you and discuss them in detail, and we’ll forward them to Dr. Sharma as well. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your kindness. I guess… I’ll just wait to hear from Dr. Sharma. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. Please remember that you're not alone in this. We'll be here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I wish you all the best.
