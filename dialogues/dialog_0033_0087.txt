DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Croonquist, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I just need some blood work done, if we could get that sorted quickly. I don’t really…do well with long waits, you see.
DOCTOR: Blood work. Yes, well, we need to establish why we’re doing blood work first. Simply ordering tests without a proper assessment… isn't good medicine. Now, what exactly prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Prompted? Oh, goodness. Honestly…the lady at the front desk said I needed it. Something about Medicare requiring it. I don’t really feel anything’s wrong. Just…routine, I guess? Is that enough? I really don’t remember much about it, to be frank.
DOCTOR: The front desk… advised you to undergo medical testing?
PATIENT: That’s…how I understood it. She was very nice, but…old age, you know? Things get muddled. I just want to get this over with. What kind of blood work are we talking about, anyway? Is it a lot? I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Medicare does have certain preventative screenings they cover, but typically there’s a discussion involved. Bruising easily… that's not helpful information without context. We need to determine what's indicated. Are you currently under the care of another physician?
PATIENT: Another physician? Hmm…not that I recall. I used to see someone…back in…well, a long time ago. Can’t remember the name. Just the usual check-ups, I suppose. Look, is it possible to just…do a basic panel? You know, to keep things simple? I’m not sure I’m up for a long investigation here. Medicare…they didn't say anything specific.
DOCTOR: A “basic panel” is…vague. We need to consider your age, your race, and even where you live. Rural areas often have different health concerns. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat most things. Dust, maybe? Gets my nose tickly. But nothing serious. Rural…yes, I suppose it is rural here. Quiet, at least. And…tall. Lots of trees. Honestly, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with blood work. Can't we just…take the sample? It won’t take long, will it?
DOCTOR: It has to do with appropriate care, Mr. Croonquist. We aren’t simply fishing for abnormalities. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications…let me think. Oh, a little something for my knees, sometimes. When they act up. Can’t recall the name, though. It’s…small, white pill. And…sometimes, a vitamin. D, I think? My neighbor suggested it. Other than that, no. Nothing regular. Is that important? Really.
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Croonquist. Interactions between medications and supplements are quite common. Now, given your age and location, and the vague complaints about your knees… we should at least perform a basic metabolic panel, a CBC, and a Vitamin D level. Can you tell me anything about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…goodness. That was…a long time ago. My father…he was a strong man. Worked with the land. Mother…she was quiet. I don't recall any…serious illnesses, honestly. Nothing jumped out, if that makes sense. Everyone just…aged, you know? Is this really necessary for the blood work? It's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: It's prudent, Mr. Croonquist. It helps us establish a baseline. Alright. Given your height and weight…have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or energy levels?
PATIENT: Changes…? Not really. I eat when I’m hungry. Sleep when I’m tired. It’s…simple. Maybe a little less energy these days, but that comes with age, doesn’t it? I haven't been feeling sick, if that’s what you’re asking. Look, can we please just get this blood draw done? I’m starting to feel a bit…flustered. It’s a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with the blood draw. However, I strongly recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and address your concerns about potential deficiencies and overall health. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…please be quick. I don’t handle needles well. And…thank you. I suppose. .
