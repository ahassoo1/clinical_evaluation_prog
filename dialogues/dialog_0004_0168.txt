DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I wanted to get a check-up before things get… too serious, you understand. One has to be prudent. It's not every man who understands the importance of good health, or, frankly, good breeding.
DOCTOR: I see. Prudence is always advisable. So, is there anything specific you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, just… everything. I want to be certain I haven’t… missed anything. You know, things one doesn't necessarily discuss with a gentleman caller. I'm a woman of a certain age, and while I maintain a very active lifestyle, one can never be too careful. Are you going to run a full panel? I trust you do comprehensive work here.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, we absolutely do. A “full panel,” as you put it, is a good starting point. We’ll do a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your organ function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol, and a urinalysis. We can also add a thyroid panel if you’d like. Do you have any specific concerns that might warrant additional testing?
PATIENT: Oh, my. All of that sounds… thorough. The thyroid, yes, that wouldn't hurt. My mother had… issues. Though she wasn't always the most reliable source of information, if you catch my drift. And, honestly, just… anything that might explain a little fatigue. Not debilitating, mind you, but I do find myself needing a bit more rest than I used to. Is that covered in all of this? Because I wouldn't want to have to come back again soon. It's such a bother, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, the comprehensive metabolic panel can give us some clues about fatigue, and we can certainly look more closely if needed. We’ll also include a Vitamin D level, as that deficiency can cause tiredness. And we’ll check your iron studies; anemia is another common cause. So, that’s CBC, CMP, lipid panel, TSH with reflex T4, urinalysis, Vitamin D, and iron studies. Now, let’s go over your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. Thankfully. I've always been very particular about my diet and exercise. A little extra weight, perhaps, but nothing a sensible routine can’t manage. My blood pressure is usually… fine. Though the nurse did seem a bit concerned last time, but I suspect the equipment was faulty. And my mother… well, she had a touch of arthritis, but I don't believe that's hereditary. It was from all that gardening, you see. She insisted on doing it herself, even when she was quite… advanced in years. Do you need a list of medications? I really don't take anything regularly. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: “Occasionally” is fine for now. We'll cover that in more detail. And it's good to hear you don’t have any chronic conditions. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Not a one. I’ve always been very careful. I prefer to avoid… invasive procedures whenever possible. A little discomfort is preferable to a scalpel, you understand. Though I did have my tonsils out as a child, of course. But that was… ages ago. And it was quite a simple procedure, I believe. They barely left a mark. Are we nearly finished? I have a luncheon appointment. It’s a charity event, and one simply must be punctual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy is good to note. Now, let's discuss family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… a difficult question. My father was a very private man. He didn’t discuss health matters. And my mother… well, she tended to exaggerate. She claimed her second cousin twice removed had a rare tropical disease, but I suspect that was simply a story. Let me think. My aunt Beatrice had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he died of something or other, quite suddenly. A heart condition, perhaps? It was a very long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, my family wasn’t terribly forthcoming about these things. It was considered rather… unseemly to dwell on illness. Do you need specifics? I really don't have much to offer.
DOCTOR: That’s… understandable. We can work with what you have. Any history of cancer in the family?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... My great aunt Mildred, on my mother's side, had something. Breast cancer, I think. Though it was a very long time ago, and she didn't survive it. It was before all the advancements they have now, of course. She was a smoker, you see. A very stubborn woman. And she refused to see a doctor until it was far too late. It's a rather sad story, really. But I assure you, there is no history of cancer on my side of the family. I've always been very careful about my health. Do you need to know anything else before we begin the tests? I'm starting to feel a bit… anxious. All this talk of illness is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knowing about your aunt Mildred is helpful. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Absolutely not. I find such habits… distasteful. A glass of sherry with luncheon, perhaps, on occasion. But nothing more. And smoking? The very idea! It’s dreadful for the complexion, you know. And recreational drugs? I should certainly hope not. I have a reputation to maintain, Doctor. I volunteer at the symphony, and my husband is a deacon at the church. We lead a very respectable life. I assure you, I don't indulge in any… questionable activities. Are we finished with the unpleasant questions now? I'm ready for the tests, if you are.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, we are. Just a few more quick questions, then we’ll get started. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. None at all. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. Though I do get a bit of a rash if I wear cheap jewelry, but that’s hardly a medical concern, is it? It’s simply a matter of sensitivity. And I occasionally sneeze when I’m around cats, but I avoid them whenever possible. Are you quite finished now? I really must be going. My hair appointment is at three o'clock. It's a new stylist, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Very good. Okay, Ms. Pandolfi. Before we proceed, I’m going to need to take your height and weight. And then we’ll take a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and then we’ll get the blood drawn. The nurse will be in shortly to get that started. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Height and weight, I suppose. Though I do try not to dwell on numbers. It's simply not… elegant. And the heart and lungs, of course. But please, be gentle. I have a rather delicate constitution. And the blood draw… I do faint easily, you know. Perhaps a cool compress? And a chair nearby, just in case? This is all rather… unsettling. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, it is. It's standard procedure, and it’s the best way to get a baseline assessment of your health. We’ll have the nurse bring a cool compress and make sure you’re seated for the blood draw. She's very experienced. Let's just step onto the scale, and then we’ll proceed. You're 166 centimeters and 93 kilograms. Now, if you'll just have a seat on the examination table...
PATIENT: Very well. But do be quick about it. I simply detest medical examinations. They’re so… impersonal. And please, no cold instruments. I’m rather sensitive, you know. Let’s get this over with. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear, but there’s a slight wheeze on exhalation. Nothing concerning at this time, but we’ll keep it noted. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Perfectly well, I might add. My eyesight is quite remarkable for my age. I attribute it to a healthy diet and plenty of reading. Though I do wear reading glasses, naturally. Is something amiss, Doctor? You’re frowning again. Is the wheeze something to be concerned about? I do have a rather delicate chest, you know. Perhaps it’s the air conditioning? It's always so cold in these places.
DOCTOR: The wheeze is mild, Ms. Pandolfi, and likely not a cause for immediate concern. It could be related to mild asthma or simply a sensitivity to irritants. However, given your history and the presence of the wheeze, I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious. It's a standard precaution. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She will be very careful. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Heavens no! That sounds… invasive! And rather frightening. Is it absolutely necessary? I do have a rather weak constitution, you know. And I’m not fond of radiation. Are you certain there aren’t any other options? Perhaps a thorough examination of my lungs with… a stethoscope? I simply don't understand why all of this is necessary. I'm dating someone, not climbing Mount Everest!
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I understand your concerns. However, it's important to be thorough, especially given your report of a slight wheeze. The X-ray will provide a clearer picture of your lungs and help rule out any potential underlying issues. It’s a very quick procedure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. Think of it as a preventative measure to ensure your good health, so you can enjoy your… relationship. I strongly recommend it. I wouldn’t order it if I didn’t believe it was necessary. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But please, be gentle. And assure me it won't ruin my hairstyle. I simply must look presentable. And what exactly does this… procedure entail? Do I have to undress? And will it be painful? I have a very low tolerance for discomfort, you know. Perhaps a sedative? Just a small one, to calm my nerves. This is all rather… unsettling. Is there any chance you’re overreacting? Perhaps it’s just a slight chill?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, you do not have to undress. You’ll simply remove any jewelry around your neck and chest. And no, it will not be painful. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and it will take a quick image of your lungs. It's similar to getting a photograph. And no, we don’t administer sedatives for a chest X-ray. The procedure is very quick and non-invasive. The technician will explain everything to you in detail before it begins. I’m recommending this to ensure we have a complete picture of your health, and I assure you, it’s a standard precaution. Now, let’s focus on getting the blood drawn first. The nurse is here. . She will take excellent care of you.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please, be gentle. And I do faint easily, you know. Perhaps a cool compress? And a chair nearby, just in case? This is all rather… unsettling. Are you certain this is absolutely necessary? I’m dating someone, not climbing Mount Everest! But if you insist… I suppose I have no choice. But please, be careful. My veins are rather… delicate. This is going to be dreadful. Simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez is very experienced, Ms. Pandolfi. She will take excellent care of you. She will let me know if she encounters any difficulty. I will be just outside if you need me. Try to relax, and take deep breaths. Please make sure Ms. Pandolfi is comfortable and has everything she needs. I’ll be right outside. Please let me know if you feel unwell at any time. .
PATIENT: .
