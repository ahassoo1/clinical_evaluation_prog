DOCTOR: Hi Danny, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Hello, Doctor. I… I have to have this done. For… the team. A physical, they said. For the tryout. It's… required. I think. Something like that. Been a while, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a physical for a team tryout. That makes sense. Let me pull up your information here… Danny Bartok, born… alright. It has your height and weight listed as 160 centimeters and 124 pounds. Is that about right?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't weighed myself in… a spell. But that sounds about right. Maybe a little low, truthfully. But yes, that’s… fine. Accurate enough, I suppose. What exactly do you need to know? I don’t have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll try to be efficient. Just to start, have you had any major medical problems in the past – things like heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Major problems… Hmm. My ex-wife gave me a headache, does that count? No, no… I think I had the flu once. A bad one. Years ago. And my knees ache sometimes. From… work. Construction. But trouble? No. Nothing a little liniment didn’t fix. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy guy. Always been.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical problems, just some knee pain and a bout of the flu a long time ago. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No. Never. I don’t… do hospitals. Too many germs, you know? And… frankly, I’ve always been lucky. Never needed any cutting or… poking around. No. None. Absolutely not. Though, old man Rodriguez down the street, he had his hip done… terrible experience, from what I heard.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… complicated. My mother, she passed a long time ago. Can’t remember what she died of. Something old, I think. My father… he wasn’t around much. And I haven’t spoken to my brother in years. He made some… poor choices. So, no. Not really. No family history to worry about, if that’s what you’re asking. Mostly just me, you know? Always been a lone wolf.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I think I got a rash once from some cheap aftershave. But that was a long time ago. And… bees. I don’t like bees. They sting. But an allergy allergy? No. Nothing serious. I can eat whatever. Take whatever pill. I'm a tough guy, Doctor. Don’t you worry about me. Though, my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she’s allergic to cats... terrible sneezing fits. But me? No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? Now you’re just asking silly questions. I told you, I’m a tough guy. I don't need medications. Maybe some liniment for the knees, like I said. And sometimes I take… something for sleep. If I can’t get to sleep. But it's just a little something. Nothing a fella shouldn't take. Not a prescription. From the bodega, you know? But that’s it. Really. Don’t need all those fancy pills. They just make you sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a bit of liniment and something over-the-counter for sleep. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, that sort of thing. It shouldn’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But don’t poke too much. And be gentle with the knees. They’re sensitive, you know? I got work to do. Let’s just get this over with. I haven't got all day to be lying around getting prodded. And please, no surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no surprises. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could just sit up on the exam table for me. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little high, 145/90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let's check your reflexes... Reflexes are normal. Finally, let’s just take a look at your knees... There's some tenderness and slight swelling in both knees. Do these bother you often?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Swelling? Of course they bother me! I told you, construction work! It’s hard on a man’s body, you know? Lifting, bending, hauling… It’s what I do. A little tenderness is part of the job. And swelling... well, it comes and goes. It's nothing a good liniment can't fix. You're making a big deal out of nothing, Doctor. I've been working like this for thirty years. Don’t tell me my knees are a problem. They're just… old. That’s all. Old and tired. But they still work. For now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've put your body through a lot. And you're right, some discomfort is expected with that kind of work. But we should still address it. High blood pressure and some swelling in the knees… it's good to get a baseline. I’d like to order a few blood tests just to check your overall health, things like cholesterol and kidney function. And an X-ray of your knees to see what’s going on beneath the surface. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? Now you're just trying to sell me something! I told you, I'm fine! I don't need tests. I need to get back to work! What are you hoping to find? Arthritis? A broken bone? Look, I appreciate the concern, Doctor, but I'm a practical man. I don’t have time for fancy procedures and waiting rooms and… and bills! I'll just use more liniment. That's all I need. Honestly, I think you’re overreacting. A little soreness is part of life. I think I’m done here. Unless you’re going to give me a note saying I’m fit to play, I don’t see the point of any of this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Danny. And I don’t want to push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. However, I am concerned about your blood pressure and the swelling in your knees. Ignoring these things could lead to bigger problems down the road. Alright, how about this?
PATIENT: What? What “how about this”? I'm listening, but don't expect me to agree to anything drastic. I got things to do, you know. This whole thing is a waste of my time, frankly. Just tell me if I can play, or not. That's all I need. A simple yes or no.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not comfortable clearing you to play without at least a basic assessment of your blood pressure. It’s significantly elevated, and that could be dangerous. I can take your blood pressure again, right now. If it’s still high, I would strongly recommend postponing the tryout until we can get it under control. I can also give you a written note outlining my concerns and recommending a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician. That’s the best I can do right now, Danny. I’m not trying to cause you trouble, but I have a responsibility to your health. Would you like me to recheck your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Check it again. But if it's still high, I'm not promising anything. This is ridiculous. A little high blood pressure… people live with that. But I guess I don't have a choice, do I? Just get it over with. And hurry. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Okay, it’s… still elevated. 150/95. That's higher than it was a few minutes ago. I’m very concerned about this, Danny. Playing with elevated blood pressure could lead to serious complications, like a stroke or heart attack. I strongly advise against participating in the tryout until we can get it under control. I can write you a note outlining my concerns, recommending a follow-up with your doctor, and advising against strenuous activity. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A stroke? Heart attack? You're trying to scare me now. Look, I've been playing sports my whole life. I'm tough. I can handle it. But… fine. Write your little note. I guess it can't hurt. But don't expect me to follow any of your advice. I got a tryout to prepare for, you know? And I'm not letting a little high blood pressure stand in my way. Old man Rodriguez never got a note like this… and he played until he was seventy. Just get it over with. I want to leave.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m writing a note outlining my concerns regarding your elevated blood pressure and recommending a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician for further evaluation and management. I’m also advising against participation in strenuous activity until your blood pressure is under control. Here you go. This also includes some information about lifestyle modifications that can help lower your blood pressure, like reducing sodium intake and increasing exercise. I understand you’re determined to participate in the tryout, but please, take this seriously. Your health is the most important thing. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Fine. Thanks. I guess. Look, I appreciate your concern, Doctor, but I got this. I'll take care of myself. I've been doing it for fifty years. Alright. I think that's enough. I'm leaving now. Don’t bother calling me. I won't answer. Bunch of fuss over nothing… just a little pressure. .
