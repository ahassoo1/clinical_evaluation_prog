DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Sobkowic. Yes. Chest…feel funny. And heart…beats too fast sometimes. Blood pressure…nurse say high. I no like. Want fix quick.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What that mean? Just…squeezes. Like…someone tight band around chest. Not all time. When I…stress. Work is stress. Always stress. I emergency man. Need fix now. No time for…long talk.
DOCTOR: Right. A squeezing sensation in your chest, particularly when you're stressed. And you mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Sobkowic. It's important to understand when this happens, how often, and how long it lasts. So, tell me, how often would you say this “squeezing” occurs?
PATIENT: Often? Hmm… maybe… two, three times week? When bad things happen at work. Big fire, accident… people yelling. Not every time. Sometimes okay. Sometimes… very bad. Last time… maybe last week? Very scare. Wife worry. You understand? Need go back work. People need me.
DOCTOR: I understand you need to get back to work, Mr. Sobkowic. And we’ll try to figure this out as efficiently as possible. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything related to your heart or blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I strong man! Emergency man, remember? No time get sick. Maybe… old doctor, long time ago, say something about…cholesterol? I no remember. I eat what I want. Wife complain. But I need energy for work! No time for… salads. You understand?
DOCTOR: Right. So, no specific heart or blood pressure diagnoses. You mentioned your wife has concerns about your diet. And you said an older doctor spoke to you about cholesterol at some point. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medication? No. Supplements? No. I no like pills. Make me sleepy. I need be awake. Need think fast. Emergencies, remember? Wife give me…vitamins sometimes. Little orange pills. I forget what for. She say good for heart. But I no think so. Waste money. You understand?
DOCTOR: So, you're not currently taking any regular medications or supplements, aside from the occasional vitamins your wife gives you. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had. I eat everything. Korean food, American food… everything. Strong stomach! No problem. I no delicate flower. You understand? I need be strong for work. No time for… sniffles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general condition. Just relax. Your heart rate is a bit fast, 98 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight irregularity. Lungs are clear, but your blood pressure is 160 over 90. That is elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? So bad? I feel okay. Maybe little tired. Work too much. Need more sleep. You fix quick? I no want long time in hospital. People need me. You understand? What you going do? Pills? No pills!
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, your blood pressure is significantly elevated and the irregularity in your heart rhythm is concerning. While you may feel okay now, consistently high blood pressure puts a strain on your heart and other organs. We need to investigate this further. I'm going to order an EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. I also want to do some blood work to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and rule out any other potential causes. I understand you don’t want to be in the hospital, and we will try to avoid that if possible. But we need to rule out anything serious. It’s possible this could be managed with lifestyle changes and medication, if necessary. We can discuss that after we have the results.
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Like… less work? That impossible. Work is my life. I no understand. EKG? Blood work? How long? I got meeting tomorrow. Very important. And pills? You keep say pills. I no like. You sure no other way? Maybe just…strong tea? My wife make good tea. You understand?
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate you sharing that work is very important to you. However, ignoring these health issues won’t make them go away, and could have serious consequences. Strong tea is unlikely to resolve an irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. The EKG and blood work will take a few hours to process. We can usually get results back the same day. I'll have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment to discuss them, and we can revisit the possibility of medication at that time, if it's warranted. Right now, the priority is to understand what's causing these issues. Are you willing to proceed with the EKG and blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Hurry. I got things to do. People need me. EKG, blood work… just… don’t take all day. And no pills. You hear me? No pills. You understand? Now… where do I go? What do I do?
DOCTOR: The nurse will take you to the lab for the blood work and EKG. It should take about an hour. After that, you're free to go. The results will be sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand your reluctance regarding medication, Mr. Sobkowic. We can discuss all options once we have a better understanding of the underlying cause of these issues. The nurse will be with you shortly.
