DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Oh, right. This cough. It's been… a long time now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something tickling in my throat, but nothing comes up. It’s just… annoying, really. I don't remember exactly when it started, to be honest. A while ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-standing dry cough. I understand. It can definitely be bothersome. You mentioned it feels like a tickle in your throat and nothing is coming up. Let’s try to get a little more detail. When you say "a while ago," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… oh dear. That’s a hard one. Maybe… last fall? Or maybe the fall before that? I get my seasons mixed up these days. It wasn't sudden, that's for sure. It just… started happening more and more. I don’t really pay attention to dates much anymore. My wife… she always kept track of things. It's different now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometime last fall or the fall before. That’s helpful. And it started gradually, not suddenly. Besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little… tired sometimes. But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I figure some tiredness is to be expected. I don’t know if that's from the cough or just… old age. No fever, no chills… I haven't lost my appetite. Still like my rice, thank goodness. Maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs, but again… stairs are stairs. Do you want me to keep thinking? My mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful, Mr. Pavlovec. You're doing great. It's good to know you haven't had fever, chills, or loss of appetite. And understanding that the tiredness and shortness of breath could be related to age is important. Just to be thorough, have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, a little. When I was younger, back in the old country... we used to smoke pipes sometimes, with the men. Not often, though. And not cigarettes, never cigarettes. Just pipes, with… well, I don’t remember what was in the pipes now. It was a long time ago. And after we came here, I mostly stayed away from smoke. My wife didn't like it. This cough isn't from that, I don't think. It feels different.
DOCTOR: Okay, some pipe smoking in the past, but not recently. Good to know. And you feel this cough is different. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me see. I’ve been to the doctor a few times, of course. But I don’t really remember what they said. My wife always did the talking for me. She remembered everything. I think I had something with my heart, a long time ago, but I can’t recall the name. Nothing serious, she always said. Just… something to keep an eye on. I don't think I ever had asthma or… what was the other one? Bronchi… bronchitis? No, I don't think so. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. My memory… it's just not reliable anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s common for memory to be affected as we get older. And it sounds like your wife was very good at managing your healthcare. We'll do our best to figure things out. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Not regularly, anyway. Sometimes, the nice lady next door gives me something for my aches, but I can't remember what it's called. It’s a little white pill, I think. But I don't take it every day, just when my joints are really bothering me. Otherwise, no. I mostly just take a little rice with my tea. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally a white pill for aches, but nothing regularly. And you prefer to avoid medication when possible. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and just get a general sense of how you’re doing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My lungs… they’ve seen a lot. Went through a lot of jungle back in the old country. Go ahead, please. Don't mind if I feel a little stiff. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated but not terribly concerning for your age. Your pulse is 78, which is good. And your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but we’ll keep an eye on that. Your lungs… I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes. And I can hear some mild wheezing. Your heart sounds are a little distant, but there are no murmurs or irregular rhythms. Do you ever feel short of breath when you're resting, or only when you're active?
PATIENT: Mostly when I’m active, Doctor. Walking up the stairs, like I said. Or if I try to carry something heavy. When I’m sitting and resting, I'm usually alright. Though sometimes, if I lie flat, I feel a little… breathless. Like something is pressing on my chest. But it goes away if I sit up. It's probably just… old age. This cough makes everything worse, of course. It’s tiring just breathing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and when lying flat. And the cough is making things more difficult. Given your age, your history of a vague cardiac issue, the diminished breath sounds, the wheezing, and your symptoms, I suspect you may have a combination of things going on. It could be some chronic bronchitis, possibly some mild heart failure contributing to the shortness of breath, and of course, the persistent cough. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. I'd also like to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. My wife… she always said it was best to know what was going on. Yes, alright. Do what you think is best. Just… try not to poke me too much, please. I get a little… sensitive. And can I still have my rice after? I really need my rice.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovec. We'll be as gentle as possible. And yes, absolutely, you can still have your rice after. That's very important. Alright, I’m ordering those tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the radiology department for the X-ray and EKG, and then she’ll draw some blood. It shouldn’t take too long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a cough suppressant to help with the cough and make you more comfortable. And I'll recommend you to a pulmonologist for a more specialized consultation if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cough suppressant sounds good, Doctor. Anything to quiet this tickle. A pulmono… what did you call it? Someone who looks at lungs? Yes, alright. If you think it’s best. My wife… she always knew who to see. I’m just glad you’re here, trying to figure things out. Thank you, Doctor. It’s… a comfort just talking to someone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s my pleasure. And you're right, sometimes just talking things through can make a big difference. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. And… thank you again. Really. Tell my wife… if you ever see her… that I miss her rice. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovec. I will definitely tell her. And I will make sure the nurse is very gentle. The nurse should be with you any moment now. Please don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Pavlovec. .
