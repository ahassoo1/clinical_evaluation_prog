DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It's about my foot. This sore… it just won’t heal. It’s been bothering me for weeks now, and frankly, I've had better things to do than sit around with a bad foot. I understand you’re the one to see about these… problems.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. And you’ve been… managing it how, exactly?
PATIENT: Managing it? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been trying to ignore it. I put some ointment on it, the kind they sell at the store. And I try not to walk on it too much. But it's just getting worse, not better. You'd think with all the advancements in… everything, they'd have something better than ointment by now. I’ve always been a practical woman, and this feels… inefficient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where on your foot is the sore located specifically?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom, Doctor. Right… around here. Not on the heel, not on the toes, but right in the middle. It's quite painful when I put any weight on it, and it’s… rather unsightly, if I may say so. I do try to keep things neat, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus draining from the area?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. There is redness. Quite a bit, actually. And it’s a little swollen, I suppose. As for… pus, well, I don’t know what exactly pus looks like, but there's some… discharge. It’s yellowish, and it gets on my socks, which is simply dreadful. I try to keep everything clean, but it’s a constant bother. Honestly, it's a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had a fever, or chills?
PATIENT: A fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. I usually run a bit cool, you know. Always have. Chills… well, it gets a bit breezy in this clinic, but that’s hardly a chill. I’m a Marshallese woman, Doctor. We’re used to the heat. I don’t get “chills” easily. It’s probably just the air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's take a look at the foot itself. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It's just… I’ve had these shoes a long time. Good leather, you don't get quality like this anymore. There. Be careful now, it's rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the ulceration. It’s approximately 2 cm in diameter, with surrounding erythema and some purulent drainage. There's also some maceration of the skin around the edges. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Quite a bit of pain. There! Right there, when you touch it. It’s a throbbing sort of pain. Not a sharp pain, but a… relentless one. Honestly, you’re poking at it, of course it hurts. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I'm going to need to ask a few more questions regarding your medical history. Do you have diabetes, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Diabetes. The doctor told me years ago, when my son was still in school. I try to watch my sugar, but honestly, it’s difficult. Especially with all the good fruits available. And sometimes, a little bit of coconut pudding is simply essential. I also had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but it’s usually under control. I’ve always been a strong woman, you know. I manage.
DOCTOR: I see here you were diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes 15 years ago, and hypertension. And what medications are you currently taking for these conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. There's the little orange pill, and the white one, and sometimes the blue one if my pressure gets high. I have a little box, but my granddaughter keeps rearranging things. She thinks she’s helping, but honestly, it just makes a mess. I don’t really keep track, Doctor. I just take what the pharmacy gives me. They know what they’re doing, I suppose. I can’t be bothered with all the details. It's a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I've taken so many pills over the years, I wouldn't even remember. I once had a bit of a rash after taking something, but it could have just been the laundry detergent. My skin is sensitive, you know. It’s a Marshallese thing. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those little warnings. If it helps, I take it. If it doesn't, I stop. Simple as that. It's always worked for me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, based on the examination and your medical history, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer. Given the redness, swelling, and drainage, there is a risk of infection. We need to take this seriously. We'll need to get some lab work done to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. I also recommend a wound culture to identify any bacteria present.
PATIENT: Oh. Infection. Well, that doesn't sound very good, does it? Lab work… wound culture… Honestly, Doctor, all this sounds terribly complicated. I just wanted something for my foot, not a whole battery of tests. Are you sure it’s that serious? It’s just a little sore. I’ve had worse. And I have that luncheon, you know. A very important luncheon. Perhaps a stronger ointment would suffice?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, with all due respect, this is not just a "little sore". You have diabetes, which impairs your body’s ability to heal and increases your risk of infection. An untreated infection in your foot can lead to serious complications, including amputation. A stronger ointment will not suffice. We need to determine the extent of the infection and start appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics and specialized wound care. I understand you have a luncheon, but your health is far more important. I will order the lab work and wound culture immediately. We'll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Amputation? Goodness gracious, Doctor, you’re being terribly dramatic! I’ve lived a long and full life, and I certainly don't intend to lose a foot over a little soreness. My son would be furious. And frankly, this is all very inconvenient. But… … if you insist. Very well. Order your tests, Doctor. But I expect a speedy diagnosis and a swift resolution. And I will need to reschedule that luncheon. It’s with the Garden Club, you know. A very important luncheon. And make sure it doesn't take all day. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I've ordered the necessary tests. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you keep weight off the foot as much as possible. I will also have the nurse give you a prescription for a course of oral antibiotics. It is crucial that you take these antibiotics exactly as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. And I strongly advise you to follow up with a podiatrist for specialized wound care. I have a referral form here that I will give to you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather overwhelming. A podiatrist… more appointments… It’s just too much. But… … what exactly does a podiatrist do, anyway? Is it terribly painful? And will this interfere with my bridge game on Thursday? That's very important, you know. I'm rather good at bridge.
DOCTOR: A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in the care of the feet. They can provide specialized wound care, debride the ulcer, and monitor for signs of infection. It shouldn't be terribly painful, although there may be some discomfort during the debridement process. As for your bridge game… … I cannot guarantee it will not interfere. However, delaying treatment could result in a more serious infection, which would definitely interfere with your bridge game, and potentially much more. It is a matter of prioritizing your health, Ms. Cannington. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with the podiatrist as soon as possible. Now, are there any other questions I can answer before you leave?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a little sore… Very well. I’ll… I’ll consider the podiatrist. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And tell me, Doctor, is there anything – anything – I can do at home to help this along? Some sort of poultice, perhaps? My grandmother always had remedies for everything. A little coconut oil, maybe? Just something to… soothe it, you know. Besides keeping weight off it, which I’m already doing, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, while I appreciate your grandmother’s remedies, I must advise against using any home treatments at this time. Coconut oil, while soothing, could potentially introduce bacteria to the wound and worsen the infection. The best thing you can do at home is to keep the wound clean and dry, and follow the instructions for taking the antibiotics. Do not attempt to treat the wound yourself. And please, if you notice any signs of worsening infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, fever, or pus – seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Clean and dry, and take the pills. Honestly, it sounds dreadfully boring. And I suppose I can try to avoid… worsening things. I believe that’s all I need for now. Thank you for your… concern. And please, don't expect me to be a regular visitor. I have a luncheon to reschedule, you know. A very important luncheon. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I expect you to contact my office immediately if you experience any concerns. And do attempt to schedule an appointment with the podiatrist. Have a… pleasant day. .
