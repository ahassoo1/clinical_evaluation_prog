DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Trendler. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 76 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Seventy-six, yes. And a good few years of hard work, let me tell ya. Look, Doc, I ain't got all day. This body… it's changed. Not for the better. I want somethin' done about it. It’s lookin’… soft. Like my wife used to say before… well, never you mind. Just fix it. Is that what you do here? Fix things?
DOCTOR: “Soft,” you say. I understand you’re concerned about changes to your physique, Mr. Trendler. While I appreciate your directness, “fixing” is rarely a straightforward matter. We need to understand what changes you’re observing and why they are occurring. To begin, can you be more specific about what you mean by “soft”?
PATIENT: Specific? You want specific? Look at me, man! Look at my belly. Used to be hard as a rock, from swingin’ that hammer all them years. Now it’s… jiggly. And these arms… feel like noodles. Used to be able to lift a whole beam on my own! Now I struggle with groceries. Is that specific enough for ya? I want it tight again. Like it used to be. Don't need a lecture, just tell me what can be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’ve noticed a loss of muscle mass and an increase in body fat. This is quite common with age, as metabolism slows and we naturally lose muscle tissue. However, there are things we can investigate to ensure there aren’t any underlying medical reasons contributing to this decline. Before we discuss potential interventions, I need to gather a more comprehensive history. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, heart disease, thyroid problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmph. Thyroid? What would that have to do with anything? Look, Doc, I've been a strong man my whole life. Eaten good food, worked hard. Never been sick a day in my life, 'cept for a bit of the flu now and then. No fancy illnesses, no heart trouble, nothin' like that. Just… gettin’ old, I guess. But I don't want to feel old, you understand? And I sure don't want to look it. Is there a pill for that? A shot? Anything quick? I ain't got time for a long process.
DOCTOR: While it’s commendable that you’ve maintained good health for so long, Mr. Trendler, even a history of excellent health doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying issues. Thyroid problems, for instance, can significantly impact muscle mass and metabolism. We need to rule things out systematically. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… No. Never. Not a single one. Too busy workin' to get cut open. Broke a rib once fallin' off a roof, but that healed on its own. Didn’t need no doctor’s help for that. Just wrapped it up tight and kept on swingin’ the hammer. This is gettin’ ridiculous, Doc. You askin’ about broken bones and… thyroids? I came here to get this belly fixed, not have a life story interrogation. You got somethin’ that can help me or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration. However, a proper medical assessment requires a thorough history. I assure you, these questions are not meant to be an interrogation, but rather to ensure I can provide you with the safest and most effective course of treatment. Rushing into a solution without understanding the underlying cause could be detrimental. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any muscle-related disorders?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmph. My mother… she died young. Somethin’ with her chest. Never knew much about it, didn't ask. My father… strong man, like me. Worked the docks his whole life. Lived to be eighty, but he was always thin. Skinny, really. No muscle on him. That’s why I started workin' so hard, ya know? To be strong. My sister… she had babies, that's all I remember. Never saw her much. Point is, nobody in my family died of… of muscle problems. Now, are you gonna help me with my problems or just keep askin' about folks I barely knew?
DOCTOR: Very well. It seems there is limited relevant family history. Now, let's discuss your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you know? And alcohol… I used to have a beer or two with my wife on a Saturday night. Just a little somethin’ to relax. But since… well, since she’s gone, I don’t bother with it. Don’t see the point. Just sits in your stomach. And I ain’t lookin’ to add more to my belly, Doc. You understand? I want to take off of it, not add to it. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with this or what? This is wastin’ my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, tell me about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Diet? Hmph. I eat. What do ya think I do? I eat good food, honest food. Fried chicken, rice and peas, stewed beef… the usual Jamaican fare. My wife used to do all the cookin', bless her soul. Now I just… eat what’s easy. A lot of takeout, I’ll admit. Not as good as her cookin’, but quick. And I like a good dumpling or two. What’s wrong with that? A man needs his dumplings! You tryin' to tell me I can't eat dumplings?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am not attempting to restrict your enjoyment of food. However, a diet high in fried foods and carbohydrates can contribute to weight gain and loss of muscle mass. Now, let's talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had none. Can eat anything, thank goodness. Shellfish, nuts, everything. Used to eat all sorts of things with my wife, never had a problem. You askin’ about what I can't eat now? Look, Doc, I'm a strong man, I can handle my food. You're makin’ me sound like a delicate flower! This is ridiculous. Are you gonna look at my belly or keep askin’ about things I ate fifty years ago? I want results, not a history lesson!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you, these questions are vital. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No! What would I need medications for? I'm a strong man, I don't need pills! A little pain reliever now and then for my back, but that's it. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing fancy. I believe in hard work and good food, not fancy drugs. You're starting to insult me, Doc. You think I'm some old, frail man who needs a pharmacy to survive? I came here for a solution, not an interrogation and a lecture on my health. Look, are you gonna help me with this belly or not? I haven’t got all day. And I’m startin’ to lose patience. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. It seems you are resistant to providing a thorough medical history. However, to proceed responsibly, I must at least conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table, and we will begin. I need to assess your overall physical condition before discussing any potential interventions. Please remove your shirt and lie flat on your back. I will listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and assess your muscle strength. Do you understand?
