DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. I'm Dr. Roseburrogh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It’s…nice to meet you too, Doctor. Um…well, I’m just…tired. Really tired. Been that way for…a while now, I guess. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit fuzzy. Is this about…the tiredness? I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness for a while now. Fuzzy is a good way to put it. We'll definitely try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. To help me understand, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. I still go to work, you know, at the pharmacy. But…by the end of the day, I just…collapse. And it’s not just physical, if you know what I mean. Like, my brain feels…slow. And…I forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was about to say…that sort of thing. It’s just…wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your energy levels and your cognitive function – your thinking and memory. You're still functioning, but it's requiring a lot more effort and it's leaving you feeling worn down. And it's been happening for a while. To clarify, would you say this tiredness is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh…constant, I think. It’s…always there, in the background. Some days are worse than others, of course. But I can’t really remember a time when I wasn’t feeling…this way. It’s just…become normal, I suppose. But normal isn’t very good, is it?
DOCTOR: No, “normal” isn’t always good. It’s good you’re addressing this even if it’s become routine. Okay, constant tiredness. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – things like changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, difficulty sleeping, feeling unusually cold or hot, or any aches and pains?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Appetite…no, not really. I eat about the same as always, I think. Weight…maybe a little bit off? I haven't been weighing myself regularly. Sleep…that's… tricky. I can sleep, but I don't always feel rested when I wake up. And yes…aches. A lot of aches. Mostly in my joints, I think. My knees, my back…old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent tiredness, joint aches, and non-restorative sleep. And no significant changes in appetite or weight. Let’s talk a bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh…well, my husband…he had heart trouble. But that wasn’t me. I…I think I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And…arthritis, maybe? The doctor said something about it…but honestly, I can’t really recall the details. It was…a long time ago. I mostly just take…what the pharmacy gives me, you know? For the aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of gallbladder removal and possible arthritis. And you manage your aches and pains with medications from the pharmacy. Do you remember what those medications are?
PATIENT: Oh dear…that’s a good question. I just…ask the pharmacist, and he gives me something. Little white pills, mostly. And sometimes a cream for my knees. I really don't pay attention to the names. I just take them as directed. I’m terrible with…well, everything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We can look up your medication history through the pharmacy records. Let's quickly go over allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat…most things. I don’t go out of my way to avoid anything. I think I’m pretty…unremarkable, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you haven't noticed any changes in your appetite or weight. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh…my mother…she had something with her nerves, I think. Always shaking. And my father…he had a weak heart, I think. He died young, actually. But…that was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. Nobody ever really talked about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of neurological issues in your mother and heart problems in your father. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I don’t smoke. And I…maybe a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Very rarely. And…absolutely not the other things. I worked at a pharmacy for goodness sake, I know better than that!
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional alcohol use, no smoking or recreational drug use. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds…fine. The quicker we get this done, the better, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Reflexes are a little diminished, and your coordination is slightly off. I’m also palpating your thyroid gland. It feels normal in size and consistency. Ears, nose, and throat all appear normal. Alright, Janie. Everything appears relatively normal on a basic exam, but the diminished reflexes and slight coordination issues, coupled with your fatigue, warrants further investigation. I want to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels , and a complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s wrong. Blood tests…fine. Just…tell me where to go, and how long it will take. I really need to get back to work, you know? And…will I get the results quickly?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist will draw a few vials of blood. It should take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. We can either schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then, or I can call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh…a call would be best, I think. I don’t really like making appointments. Too much…fuss. Just call me, and tell me what’s wrong. My number is…555-1212. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Perfect. 555-1212. I’ve got it noted. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can, and drink plenty of fluids. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s…that’s everything, I think. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you…trying to figure this out. I really hope I can get some answers soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. I understand your frustration, and we will do our best to get you some answers. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before I call with your results. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
