DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's... well, my hearing's been going funny. And I get dizzy sometimes. It comes and goes, you see. It's hard to explain, really. It just... happens. My daughter, Lani, she booked the appointment for me. She was worried. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a little while now, I think.
DOCTOR: "A little while," you say. Right. Well, these things often develop gradually. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific... yes, right. It's... hard to pinpoint. Maybe... six months ago? Or was it longer? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. And it’s not constant. Some days I'm fine, others… well, everything feels a bit off. Like the room is spinning, or sounds are muffled. I get a bit scared, to be honest. It reminds me of my husband, bless his soul. He had similar things happen before… but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. And this dizziness… does anything trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger...? Hmm. Not that I've noticed, not really. It just... comes on. Sometimes when I'm standing, sometimes when I'm sitting. I was at the bingo hall last week, and I felt a bit wobbly there, but I just thought it was because I was excited about getting a good card! Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. I mostly just try to ignore it, but Lani insisted I come see someone. She worries so.
DOCTOR: I understand. And when you say “muffled,” is it both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think... Usually, it’s just the left ear. Yes, definitely the left. The right ear seems okay most of the time. Though, sometimes, if I really strain, it feels a bit quiet on that side too. But the left one is where I really notice it. It’s like… someone turned the volume down really low. And then it comes back on, and off, and on again… it’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any ringing in your ears, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Oh, now that you mention it… yes! A little bit. Not constant, like the hearing loss, but sometimes, especially at night, I hear a faint ringing. It’s a high-pitched sort of sound. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it’s there. I just put it down to old age, really. Everything’s making noises these days! Is that normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Old age" isn't a diagnosis, Ms. Mayhugh. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any fullness or pressure in your left ear along with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear, you're right, I shouldn't have said that. Pressure… hmm. Yes, sometimes. It feels… blocked, like something’s stuffed in there. Not always, but when my hearing's bad, I can definitely feel a sort of fullness. Like an earache, but without the pain, you see? It’s a strange feeling. I usually try to wiggle my jaw a bit, but that doesn't always help. My daughter says I should have gotten it checked sooner... she's probably right.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to perform a quick examination of your ears, nose, and throat. Then we'll do a few simple balance tests. It will give me a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. Not that I know of, no. I haven't taken much medicine in years, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for my arthritis, and I haven’t had a problem with those. I’m usually alright with things, but I am a bit sensitive to strong smells. That can make me a bit dizzy, actually. But medicines themselves, no, I don't think so. Is that okay? I hope I haven't forgotten anything!
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Alright, let's begin. If you could just sit up straight and look ahead, please. I'm just going to take a quick look inside your ears... Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen buildup in the left ear canal, and the tympanic membrane appears slightly dull. The right ear looks normal at first glance. Now, let’s check your nose… Nothing remarkable there. And finally, your throat… Everything appears normal. Now, I'm going to perform a few balance tests. Please follow my finger with your eyes…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Follow your finger… yes, I can do that. It’s a bit wobbly though, Doctor. I told you I get dizzy sometimes! Is that normal for the test, or is it just me? I’m trying my best, honestly. It's just a bit hard to concentrate with everything going on, you see? My head feels a bit funny…
DOCTOR: Yes, well, dizziness would affect the results. Based on the examination and your symptoms, it sounds like you may be experiencing Meniere's disease or a similar inner ear disorder. However, we need further testing to confirm. I'm going to order an audiogram to assess your hearing loss more thoroughly, and possibly an MRI to rule out any other underlying issues. Do you have any questions so far, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Meniere’s… that sounds rather frightening. An MRI? Is that… is that safe? I don’t understand. What does it mean? And what will happen if it is that? I feel a bit overwhelmed, Doctor. My daughter always said I should get things checked, but I didn’t want to bother anyone. Is it… serious? And will I lose my hearing? I'm sorry, I’m just asking a lot of questions, I just... I don't like the sound of all this.
DOCTOR: It’s a complex condition, Ms. Mayhugh, and I understand your concern. Meniere's disease affects the inner ear, causing episodes of dizziness, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the ear, as you’ve been experiencing. The MRI is perfectly safe; it uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your inner ear, it doesn't involve any radiation. It will help us rule out other possible causes, like a tumor. As for your hearing, the progression of hearing loss varies greatly from person to person. Some people experience only mild loss, while others may have more significant loss over time. We'll know more once we have the results of the tests. I will refer you to an otolaryngologist, a specialist in ear, nose, and throat disorders, to discuss your options further. They will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye… no, I don’t think so. I haven't had any procedures that needed that before. I’ve never really been in hospital, except when I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, all this talk of tests and specialists is making me a bit anxious. My husband always took care of things like this. I’m not very good with medical stuff. What sort of treatment are we talking about? Will I need an operation? And how long will it take to get these test results? I just want to get back to my bingo, you see. It's the only thing that keeps me going these days.
DOCTOR: Treatment options vary depending on the severity of your symptoms. They can range from medication to manage the dizziness and tinnitus to, in some cases, surgery. We'll discuss all the possibilities once we have a definitive diagnosis. As for the test results, it typically takes about a week to get them back from the lab. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. I will write a referral to Dr. Alistair Finch, a very reputable ENT specialist. I also suggest you avoid any strenuous activity and refrain from driving until we know more. Here is the referral form and the information about the audiology appointment. Do you have any further questions before I conclude the consultation?
