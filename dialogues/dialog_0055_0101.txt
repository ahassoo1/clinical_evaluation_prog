DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're 87 years young. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Eighty-seven, that’s right! Feels more like sixty some days, ha! Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now, it has.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. And you describe it as being at the back of your head… for “a little while” is rather vague, Mr. Popova. Could you be a bit more specific about how long?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, you’re right. “A little while” isn’t very helpful, is it? Hmm… let me think. It started, I reckon, about… three weeks ago, maybe a bit more. Not every day at first, just now and then. But the last week, it’s been pretty much constant, if that makes sense. A dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp pain, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, constant for the last week… and a dull ache at the back of the head. Do you find anything makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. I haven't really noticed anything makin' it worse, to be honest. Layin' down sometimes helps a little, I suppose. But not much. And nothin' seems to really get rid of it completely. I've tried takin' a little nap, drinkin’ some water… usual things, you know? But it just… lingers.
DOCTOR: Lingers, you say. And you’ve tried rest and hydration without significant relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No dizziness, nothin' like that. And no blurry vision. I haven't been feelin' sick to me stomach, either. Now that I think of it... I have been a bit more tired than usual, lately. But I figured that was just gettin’ old, ha! Could be somethin' to do with that, maybe? I don’t know. I haven’t noticed anything else specific, no.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea. Increased fatigue... understandable at your age, but we shouldn’t dismiss it entirely. And you haven’t experienced any fever or neck stiffness?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And me neck doesn't feel stiff, no. I can turn it alright, move it around… feels normal. I’ve been keepin’ active, walkin’ around the neighborhood most days, you know? Gotta keep movin’, that’s what I always say. But this headache… it’s just puttin’ a damper on things.
DOCTOR: Walking is good. Very good. Alright, Mr. Popova, let's do a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological assessment—just to be thorough. Then we can discuss potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood pressure and pulse, and that… neurological assessment, you called it? Alright, go right ahead. I’ll do whatever I can to help. Just let me know if I need to do somethin’ special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not terribly concerning in and of itself. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let's just check your reflexes… Alright, good. And your strength appears normal in all extremities. Can you feel this when I touch your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that, Doctor. Feel it quite clearly, actually. A little bit cold, but that's alright, ha! Everything feels… normal, so far as I can tell. Been a long time since anyone checked me over like this, so it’s good to know everything’s still workin’. You're doin’ a thorough job, I must say.
DOCTOR: Sensation is intact. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. Eyes tracking normally. Alright, Mr. Popova. Everything appears… within normal limits, frankly. Given your age and the relatively mild nature of your symptoms, it’s likely this is just a tension headache. Perhaps some stress, or minor dehydration. However... Given the persistence of the headache, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A tension headache, you reckon? Hmm. Stress… well, life is stressful, ha! And I suppose I haven't been drinkin' as much water as I should, come to think of it. But it’s lingered a bit longer than usual, hasn’t it? Yes, Doctor, orderin’ those tests sounds sensible. Better to be safe than sorry, that’s what I always say. A complete blood count and a… basic metabolic panel. Alright, whatever you need, just let me know. Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Yes, it has lingered. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll need a requisition form – I’ll have my assistant, Nurse Davies, print that for you. She'll also give you instructions on fasting requirements – you may need to avoid eating or drinking for a few hours beforehand. While we wait for the results, I suggest increasing your fluid intake and practicing some relaxation techniques. I can provide a pamphlet on stress management, if you’d like. We’ll follow up in one week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Down the hall, second door on the left… and ask for Nurse Davies. Got it. A pamphlet on stress management… well, I’m not sure I’ve ever needed one of those before, ha! But I’ll take it, just in case. One week to follow up… alright. That gives me time to drink more water and try to relax, I suppose. Thank you for lookin’ into this, Doctor. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Popova. Nurse Davies will be with you shortly. Just remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Otherwise, we’ll see you in one week. Have a pleasant day.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will remember that. Worse symptoms, emergency room… got it. And I will try to relax. You too, Doctor. Have a good day as well. .
