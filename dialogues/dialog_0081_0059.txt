DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. It’s my speech, I think. It feels… off. Like I’m not saying things clearly. I noticed it a few days ago, and it hasn’t gotten any better. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, though. It’s just… slurred, sometimes.
DOCTOR: "A few days ago," you say. Slurred speech. Alright. And is this slurring constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It’s not… all the time. Some days I don’t even notice it. Others… well, like today, I’m a bit worried about it. My husband said he noticed it too, this morning. I don’t know if that means anything.
DOCTOR: Your husband noticed it this morning. That’s… useful information. And when you say “slurred,” can you describe how it feels to you?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… like my tongue is heavy, maybe? Or like I'm trying to say the words really fast, but they all get jumbled up. It's not a pain or anything, just… difficult. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain how something feels when you’re trying to talk, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Heavy tongue,” and a sensation of trying to speak too quickly, resulting in jumbled words. Alright. Have you experienced any weakness in your face or limbs?
PATIENT: Weakness? Um… not that I’ve noticed, no. I do a lot of lifting at work, you see, as a construction manager, and I haven’t had any trouble with that. I've felt a little tired lately, but that's just from the heat, I think. We've been working really long hours. I don’t feel weak, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No noticeable weakness, and attributing some fatigue to work. Good. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. I can eat and drink normally, I think. And my vision… well, it's not the best, I wear glasses, as you can see, but it hasn't changed recently. Everything looks the same as usual, blurry, mostly. No new spots or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… not really. Just some vitamins, occasionally. Nothing regular. Oh! And sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it, but that’s just over-the-counter, you know, like ibuprofen. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Vitamins occasionally, ibuprofen as needed. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything, to be honest. My husband always checks the labels when we buy new things, just in case. He’s very cautious. I think if I was allergic to something, he'd know!
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that’s… a hard question. I’ve had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. And I broke my arm once when I was a teenager, silly story involving a tree and a bicycle. But nothing… major. No serious illnesses or surgeries, no. My memory isn’t the best, you see, so I’m probably forgetting something, but nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant past medical or surgical history. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to him, so I don’t really remember the details. My husband's family is healthy, as far as I know. They're very active, always doing something. I wish I remembered more details, sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of hypertension and some cardiac issues in the grandfather. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work a lot, as I said. Long hours, outdoors. I try to eat healthy, mostly, but it’s hard when you’re always on the go. I don't really drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. I don’t really have much time for hobbies, to be honest. Work takes up most of my life.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright, Ms. Swaby. Let's do a quick neurological exam. I want to check your reflexes, coordination, and cranial nerves. This will help me assess the nature of your speech difficulty. It's a standard procedure. If you could just sit up for me and follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best. I’m a little nervous, though, if I’m honest. I don't like being examined. But I want to find out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. Keep your gaze fixed on the pen.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m following it. Just tell me if I need to look a different way. It's a little hard to see clearly, even with my glasses. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Eye movements appear normal, though slightly limited. Now, I want you to smile for me. And stick out your tongue.
PATIENT: Like this? And… Is that alright? It feels a bit strange doing this on command. My face feels a little… tight, maybe? I don’t know if that’s normal.
DOCTOR: Mild facial weakness observed on the left side. Now, let’s test your strength. I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Squeeze as hard as you are able, and don't hold back.
PATIENT: I’m squeezing… is this enough? It feels a bit difficult to get a good grip on this side. I don’t usually have trouble with my hands, I lift heavy things at work all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to push against my hands with your arms and legs, resisting my pressure. Try to push against me as hard as you can. We’ll start with your arms. Push against me like you’re trying to lift something heavy.
PATIENT: I’m trying… it’s a little harder than it should be, I think. Is this enough? I’m really trying to push. My arm feels a bit… heavy again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Swaby, based on the neurological exam, I’m concerned about possible weakness on your left side. These findings—the asymmetry when smiling, the weaker grip, and the resistance during limb movement—suggest a potential neurological issue. I need to order some imaging, specifically an MRI of your brain, to rule out anything serious, such as a stroke or a lesion. We need to act quickly to determine the cause of these symptoms. I’m also going to order blood work to rule out any other underlying conditions.
PATIENT: A stroke? Oh goodness… I… I don’t understand. I just thought it was… tiredness. I haven't felt very well lately, but I didn't think it was anything serious. An MRI? What does that involve? Will it hurt? Is… is this bad? I feel very scared now.
