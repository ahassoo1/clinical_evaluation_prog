DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Paulino. It's my foot, you see. It's been... troubling me. A sore, mostly. A bad sore. Been there a little while now, and it's not getting better. It hurts to walk, even with shoes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A sore on your foot that’s not improving with time, and causing pain with walking. Alright. Let’s get some more details. When did you first notice this sore, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think... It was after I tripped in the garden. Maybe… two, three months ago now? It didn’t seem like much at first, just a little scrape. But it hasn’t healed like it should. I thought it would get better on its own, but… no luck.
DOCTOR: Two to three months. And it started after a fall in the garden. Did you seek any treatment for the fall itself – perhaps at the hospital or with another doctor?
PATIENT: No, no hospital. Just a little scrape, like I said. I cleaned it with soap and water and put a bandage on it. My wife… she always took care of these things. But… she's gone now. So, I just kept doing what she would do. Maybe that wasn’t right? I don’t know. It just never got better.
DOCTOR: I see. And you’ve been managing it yourself this entire time. Alright. Can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well... it’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It's… red, around the edges. And it looks kinda deep. Not just a surface scrape anymore. And it… smells a little. Not good, if you know what I mean. It’s not a big sore, but it’s enough to make walking very uncomfortable. I try to wear thick socks, but it still hurts.
DOCTOR: Redness around the edges, appears deep, and there’s an odor. I understand it’s causing you discomfort even with socks. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore – pus, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes... yes, I think so. Sometimes, when I change the bandage, there’s a little… white stuff. Not a lot, but it’s there. It doesn’t smell good, Doctor. And sometimes… a little bit of blood. It worries me. I try to keep it clean, but… it’s hard. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Drainage with an odor and some blood... Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm going to need to take a look at this foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Here you are. Be careful, now. It might not look so pretty. I've tried my best to keep it covered.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see it. There's a noticeable ulceration on the plantar surface of your foot, near the metatarsal heads. The surrounding skin is erythematous and there's some maceration. I do see some purulent drainage. The area is warm to the touch. Mr. Stoegbauer, I’m concerned about a possible infection. Your circulation seems adequate, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or neuropathy?
PATIENT: Oh my... You mean... bad infection? Yes… yes, I have the… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, they call it. And the doctor told me… something about my feet. Nerves, maybe? That I wouldn't feel things as much. I forget the fancy words. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor. My wife… she handled all that. I just know I have to be careful with my feet.
DOCTOR: Diabetes and neuropathy... That explains a great deal, Mr. Stoegbauer. Neuropathy can certainly contribute to a loss of sensation and make it difficult to detect problems early on. And diabetes impairs healing and increases your risk of infection. We need to get this properly assessed and treated. I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. I'll also need to obtain a culture of the wound to identify any specific bacteria present. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds right. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and… the culture? Is that going to hurt? I don't like needles much. But if it helps… I want to get this fixed. It's just… worrying me so much. I haven't been able to walk properly in weeks.
DOCTOR: The blood work will involve a standard needle stick, yes. The wound culture may cause a brief, mild stinging sensation as we swab the area. It shouldn’t be overly painful, but I understand your apprehension. We’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m also going to take a quick look at the circulation in your feet with a Doppler ultrasound, just to make sure everything is flowing properly. Then, based on the results, we’ll determine the best course of action – which may involve antibiotics and specialized wound care. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes... Yes, that sounds... good. Check everything, you said? The blood, the nerves, the... the flow? Alright. As long as you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be quick with the needle. And… gentle, like you said. I just want to be able to walk again without pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let’s get started. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, we'll do the Doppler ultrasound to assess the circulation. Then, I’ll take a small sample of blood. And finally, I’ll gently swab the wound for the culture. It will all be over before you know it. Now, just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try. It’s been a long time since anyone checked my feet this closely. It's… nice to have someone looking after it. Is that… that cold thing supposed to feel like that? It’s a little chilly.
DOCTOR: That's the gel, Mr. Stoegbauer – it’s cold, yes. It helps with the transmission of the ultrasound waves. It's perfectly normal. I'm detecting good pulses in your feet, which is a good sign. Now, I'm going to clean the area with an alcohol swab... just a quick wipe. Then, a small needle stick for the blood draw. It will be over quickly, I promise. Just try to relax your leg, and breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Okay... Deep breaths... Just like my wife used to tell me. But I don't like needles... Never have. Hurry it up, please, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, that's it. All done. See?
PATIENT: Oh... that wasn't so bad, actually. Still don't like needles, but... not so bad. Now, the swab thing? Is that next? I hope it doesn't hurt much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, just a quick swab of the wound now. It might be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. There we go... just a few seconds. All done. See?
PATIENT: Okay... that wasn’t too terrible either. A little sting, but not bad. You were very gentle, Doctor. Thank you. Now... what happens next? Do I have to wait for the results? And... what about the pain? Is there anything I can do for the pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll need to send the blood work and the wound culture to the lab for analysis. It usually takes about 48 to 72 hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of oral antibiotics to cover the infection. I'll also recommend a topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the wound twice a day. As for the pain, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever. And I'm going to recommend that you keep weight off your foot as much as possible for the next few days – crutches may be helpful. I'll also give you a referral to a podiatrist for specialized wound care. They’ll be able to debride the wound and provide more comprehensive treatment. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Yes… antibiotics, ointment, pain pills, crutches, and… a foot doctor. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel… a little better knowing there’s a plan. When should I expect to hear about the results? And… who do I call if I have questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'll have my nurse call you in 48 to 72 hours with the lab results. She'll also schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the findings and adjust your treatment plan as needed. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever – please contact my office immediately. Here are your prescriptions, and this is the referral to the podiatrist. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. My office number is listed on the referral information. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: No... no, I think that’s everything. You've been very kind and patient, Doctor. I appreciate all your help. I’ll call if I have any trouble. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. Get some rest, and try to keep weight off your foot. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day. .
