DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my leg. It’s been… swelling up. After the cancer stuff, you know? It’s just… bothersome. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatment… that can certainly be concerning, and we want to figure out what's going on. When you say “after the cancer stuff,” do you mind telling me a little more about what treatment you had, and when you finished it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It was… a long time ago now. About, oh, five years maybe? I had… the chemo. And then the radiation. Lots of it. It was for… breast cancer. Yes, breast cancer. I finished, well, I think it was in the spring of 2020. Or maybe 2021? It all blurs together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly understandable. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Let’s see… ah, here we are. I see you were treated for Stage II breast cancer in 2020, with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Thank you for clarifying. Now, about this swelling… could you tell me where exactly on your leg is it?
PATIENT: Oh, good, you found it! Yes, Stage II… that’s right. The swelling… it’s mostly in my right leg. Not the whole thing, but… the calf. And a little bit around my ankle. It’s hard to explain. It gets bigger in the evenings, mostly. And it feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly in the calf, and a little around the ankle. Is it on the front of your calf, the back, or all over?
PATIENT: Mostly the back, I think. Yes, the back of the calf feels… thicker. And sometimes it feels a bit warm. Not hot, exactly, just… warmer than the other leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And you mentioned it feels tight. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Not really painful, no. More… uncomfortable. Like a really heavy feeling. And sometimes it itches a little. It’s mostly just… annoying, you know? I can’t really wear my good shoes anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating, especially when it affects your daily activities. Before we do a quick examination, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any redness or changes in the skin on your leg?
PATIENT: No, not really. The skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little dry, but I always have dry skin. No redness, though. And no sores or anything like that. Just… puffy.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, making a note of the lack of redness and sores. Okay, no skin changes… Puffiness and tightness. Alright. Let’s take a look at your leg, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just… hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take a look. I'm just going to visually compare both legs first, and then I’ll gently feel them and check your pulses. Okay. Visually, your right leg does appear a bit fuller than your left, particularly in the calf. And when I feel it, it feels slightly firmer as well. Your pulses feel strong and equal in both legs, which is good. Now, I'm going to measure the circumference of both calves, just to get an accurate comparison. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Measuring… okay. As long as it doesn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt at all. Just a simple measurement. Okay, so your right calf measures 42 centimeters, and your left measures 38. A difference of 4 centimeters. That’s consistent with what I was feeling. Now, one more quick thing. I’m going to gently press on your skin with my thumb for a few seconds. Just to see if there’s any pitting. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Pitting? What’s that?
DOCTOR: Apologies, that’s medical terminology. It just means I'm going to press on your skin briefly to see if a little dent remains for a moment when I release. It can indicate fluid retention. Just a quick test, nothing to worry about. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, yes, that’s alright. A dent… okay. I think I understand. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do see a little bit of pitting there, meaning a small dent remains briefly after I press. That, combined with the swelling and your history of cancer treatment, makes me suspect this might be lymphedema. Have you ever heard of that before?
PATIENT: Lym… what-edema? No, I don’t think so. Is that bad? Is that what’s wrong with my leg?
DOCTOR: It’s a bit of a mouthful, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is!
DOCTOR: Lymphedema is swelling that happens when fluid builds up in the tissues because the lymphatic system isn’t working properly. The lymphatic system is like a network of tubes that helps drain fluid from your body. Sometimes, after cancer treatment, especially if lymph nodes were removed or damaged during surgery or radiation, the fluid can’t drain properly, and that can cause swelling. It’s not necessarily bad, but it does need to be managed. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… I think so. So, the tubes… they got messed up when I had the cancer stuff? And now the water… the fluid… can’t get out? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ve got it. It’s like a drainage system. If something blocks or damages the pipes, the water backs up. In your case, the treatment for your breast cancer might have affected some of those lymphatic “pipes”, causing fluid to build up in your leg. That’s why we suspect lymphedema. Now, it’s important to confirm this with some tests, but this is the most likely explanation based on what we’ve discussed and what I’ve found during the exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That… makes sense. So, what do we do about it? Can you fix the pipes?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, we can’t directly “fix” the pipes, as you put it. But we can definitely manage the swelling and prevent it from getting worse. The main treatments for lymphedema are things like manual lymphatic drainage - a special type of massage to help move the fluid - compression therapy using stockings or wraps, and exercise. We can also work on skin care to prevent infections, as swollen skin is more prone to them. First, I’d like to send you for an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the swelling, like a blood clot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… okay. If you think it’s best. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all. It’s completely painless. A technician will use a gel and a handheld device to create images of the tissues in your leg. It's just like a pregnancy ultrasound. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment for you. I'll also write you a prescription for compression stockings for now, which can really help manage the swelling. Would you like me to explain how to use them?
PATIENT: Okay. No hurt… good. And stockings… yes, please. How do I use them? They don’t look very easy to put on!
DOCTOR: You’re right, they can be a bit tricky at first! It's important to put them on first thing in the morning, before your leg has a chance to swell. You'll want to turn them inside out and gently roll them up your leg, making sure to smooth out any wrinkles. It's like putting on a sock, but a bit more carefully. I can give you a handout with detailed instructions, and there are also some helpful videos online. If you’re having trouble, a physical therapist can help you learn the correct technique. Here’s what I’m going to do. I’ll write you the prescription for the stockings, and a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in lymphedema management. I’ll also order the ultrasound. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything so well. I feel a little less worried now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're in this together. We'll get this under control. I'll give you all the information you need to schedule the ultrasound and physical therapy. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Feel free to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
