DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting harder to do things, you know? Little by little, it feels like my body isn't listening to me like it used to. It’s been going on for a while now, but it’s definitely worse lately. I hope you can help me understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Weakness... and it's been progressively getting worse. Can you tell me a little more about where you're feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it started in my legs, I think. Harder to walk long distances, you know? Then it started in my hands. Dropping things more often. Now… it feels like it’s everywhere a little bit, but mostly still in my legs and hands. It’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. Just… tired. Like they don’t have the strength they used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Tired” is a good way to put it. And it started in the legs and hands, now it’s more generalized. When you say “harder to walk distances,” can you give me a sense of how far you used to be able to walk comfortably, and how that’s changed?
PATIENT: Well, before… I could walk all day, almost. I used to take my grandchildren to the park, and we’d walk all around. Maybe a mile or two, easy. Now… maybe just to the mailbox and back, and I need to sit down for a bit after. It's… embarrassing, sometimes. I used to be so strong.
DOCTOR: A mile or two easily, and now struggling with the distance to the mailbox. That’s a significant change, Dorman. And it’s understandable that would be frustrating. Okay. Has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, just comes and goes. And I get… well, dizzy sometimes, but not falling down dizzy. Just like the room is spinning a little. Oh, and I get very tired, even when I’ve slept a good night. More tired than just the legs, you know? Like… bone tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, dizziness, and significant fatigue beyond just the leg weakness. That's helpful information. Do you notice if anything specifically triggers the blurry vision or dizziness?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. The blurry vision… I think it happens more when I’m hot. Like, after I’ve been outside in the sun. And the dizziness… I don’t know, sometimes it just happens. Sometimes when I stand up too fast. Not always, though. It's all very… confusing.
DOCTOR: Alright, blurry vision with heat exposure, and dizziness sometimes with quick movements. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I had the usual things, you know, high blood pressure, a little bit of arthritis in my knees. But nothing… serious. Oh, and about ten years ago, a doctor told me I had something with my nerves. Multiple… sclerosis, I think that’s what he said. He gave me some pills, but they didn’t seem to do much, so I stopped taking them after a while.
DOCTOR: Multiple sclerosis… Okay, that’s important information. Do you remember if you saw any specialists for that diagnosis, or where you received that treatment?
PATIENT: It was a long time ago, Doctor. I think it was at the big hospital in Honolulu. But I don’t remember the doctor’s name. And… no, I didn’t really see a specialist. Just my regular doctor at the time told me that’s what he thought it was. I wasn’t feeling too bad then, so I didn’t push it too much. I just wanted to get on with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the diagnosis wasn't fully investigated at the time. Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had one. I always tried to stay healthy, you know? Just regular check-ups and things like that. I used to be very active, always working in the yard or playing with the grandkids.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Let’s talk about your family. Is there a history of any neurological conditions – things like weakness, memory problems, or anything similar – in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard question, Doctor. My family is very big, and we don’t talk about these things much. I know my auntie, my mother’s sister, she had trouble walking when she got old. But I don’t know if it was the same thing as me. And my uncle… he used to forget things a lot. But he was always a little bit… absent-minded, you know? Nothing serious, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of walking difficulties and memory problems in the family, but nothing definitive. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, when my knees are really bothering me. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I was low on it. That's about it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Tylenol as needed, and Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, take any medicine, no problem. My wife always jokes that I have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your strength and coordination. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if it will hurt or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. It shouldn't be painful, just some basic movements and tests. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated. Heart sounds are a little irregular, but no obvious wheezing or crackles. Your reflexes are a bit diminished in your legs. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple things. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. There. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Your arms feel good. Now, I want you to close your eyes and spread your arms out in front of you. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Alright. There. How does that look? It's not as easy as it used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Dorman. I see. I noticed a little bit of slowness and some unsteadiness, and a bit of a shuffle. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of potential multiple sclerosis and these new symptoms, it's important to rule that out or get a better understanding of it. Also, the irregular heart rhythm could be contributing to your fatigue and weakness. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers. I also want to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm more closely. Finally, I’d like to get an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to look for any signs of multiple sclerosis or other neurological conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… like a lot, Doctor. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, that’s alright. I just want to know what I’m dealing with, you know? It's scary not knowing. So, blood tests, EKG, and… MRI? Is that painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dorman. It does sound like a lot, but it's important to get a thorough evaluation. The MRI is not painful. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it's important to remain very still. It’s a bit noisy, so we’ll give you earplugs. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. I'll give you a list of instructions for the MRI. While we’re waiting for those results, I also want you to keep a journal of your symptoms. Note when they occur, how severe they are, and if anything seems to trigger them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A journal… okay, I can do that. Write things down. Hmm… I guess my only question is… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like to wait around, you know? And… will these tests tell us for sure what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Dorman. The blood tests usually take 2-3 business days to come back. The EKG results are typically available within a day or two. The MRI, however, can take a bit longer – usually 5-7 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. As for whether the tests will tell us for sure what’s wrong, that's not always possible. Sometimes, the tests are clear, and we need to do further investigation. However, these tests will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe dizziness, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or vision changes – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all makes sense. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll try to keep track of my symptoms and wait for the tests to come back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will schedule the tests for you before you leave. She’ll also give you the instructions for the MRI and the symptom journal. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We're here to support you. I’ll see you back in a week to discuss the results. Take care, Dorman.
PATIENT: .
