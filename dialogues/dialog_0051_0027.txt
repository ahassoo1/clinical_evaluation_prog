DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s my stomach. Food keeps… coming back up. It's a nuisance, really. I eat, and then, well, you can imagine. It’s not pleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Altine. We’ll get right to it. It sounds quite bothersome. When did this start happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... it’s been… well, a few months now, I suppose. Not constant, mind you. It comes and goes. It's worse when I… indulge. I like a good meal, you see. And sometimes those meals don't stay put. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I see. A few months, intermittent, and seems related to richer meals. Can you describe what the… coming back up… looks like?
PATIENT: Well, it's… food, naturally. Undigested mostly. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, sometimes… more. It's not like violent vomiting, thankfully. Just… a return trip, you could say. And it leaves a nasty taste, obviously. I've always had a strong stomach, so this is rather… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, undigested food, not projectile, and a bad taste. And you said it’s unusual for you, given your generally strong stomach. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this – like nausea before it happens, heartburn, bloating, or any pain in your abdomen or chest?
PATIENT: Heartburn, yes! That’s a good one. It burns like a furnace sometimes, especially after… well, you know. Those richer meals. Bloating a bit too, but that’s nothing new, frankly. I’m not a small man, and I enjoy my food. Nausea… not usually before, but definitely after the… return trip. It’s just generally unpleasant, the whole affair.
DOCTOR: Alright, heartburn, especially after meals, bloating, and nausea after the episodes. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like ulcers, acid reflux, or anything else related to your stomach or digestive system?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been… robust, healthy. I’ve never really needed a doctor, if you catch my drift. A bit of a cold now and then, a pulled muscle from gardening, but nothing serious. My wife keeps telling me I should get a check-up every year, but I tell her I'm wasting good money. This… this is the first time I've really had a problem like this.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve generally been healthy, and this is new. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Completely untouched by the knife, thank goodness. Always considered it a sign of weakness, honestly. My father always said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it," and I’ve lived by that motto. This whole situation is rather… unsettling, as I’ve never had to deal with anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you said your father instilled a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy. Let’s move on to family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any history of stomach problems, like ulcers, acid reflux, or cancer?
PATIENT: My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach later in life, a bit of indigestion, but nothing they ever really did anything about. Just chalked it up to old age, you see. My father, strong as an ox, never had a day’s illness in his life. My sister… she worries too much to even have a stomach ache, if you ask me. So, not really. Nothing major, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild indigestion in your mother, but nothing significant. And let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. My wife insists on it. And I take an aspirin every other day, just for my knees, they get a bit creaky in the cold weather. No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, which is one of life’s great pleasures. I don't believe in coddling myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and aspirin as needed for your knees, and no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched the stuff. My father had a bad experience with it in the war, and it put me off for life. As for alcohol… I enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner now and then. A good Cabernet Sauvignon, you see. But nothing excessive. I'm not a drinker, not really. Just a civilized indulgence.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and occasional red wine. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. And be gentle. I'm a large man, but I'm not made of iron. Just listen and tell me what you find. The quicker we get this done, the quicker I can get home.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening now. I do hear some normal bowel sounds. There's a little bit of tenderness when I press here, on the left side, but nothing too alarming. No masses, no guarding. It seems a little distended, but that could be related to the bloating you mentioned. I’m going to ask about your diet in a bit more detail. Do you tend to eat large portions?
PATIENT: Large portions? Well, yes. I wouldn't say I overeat, but I enjoy a hearty meal. And I don’t believe in leaving food on the plate, you see. It’s wasteful. My wife tries to give me smaller servings, but I usually… supplement it. It’s just common sense. A man needs his fuel.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, larger portions and ensuring you finish your plate. It sounds like this has been a long-standing pattern. Given your symptoms and what we’ve discussed, it’s possible this could be related to gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, and potentially some degree of a hiatal hernia. The larger meals and not leaving any food on your plate can exacerbate the symptoms.
PATIENT: GERD? Hiatal… what did you call it? Look, I don’t need fancy medical terms. Just tell me what this means. Is it serious? Do I need to be worried? I don't have time for complicated illnesses. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: It means your stomach acid is coming back up into your esophagus, causing the heartburn and nausea. The hiatal hernia, if present, is just a small part of your stomach pushing up through the diaphragm, which can contribute to the acid reflux. It's generally not serious, Mr. Altine, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, can lead to some complications. We can manage it with some lifestyle changes and medication. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. An endoscopy would allow us to look directly at your esophagus and stomach. And a pH monitoring test can measure the amount of acid reflux you're experiencing. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Look, I told you, I don't have time for this. Endoscopy? That sounds… unpleasant. And monitoring my acid? Honestly, doctor, I'm a busy man. Can’t we just… give me something for the heartburn? A pill, maybe? I'll try to eat less, alright? Just give me something to stop the burning. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. While I strongly recommend the tests for a proper diagnosis, we can start with medication to manage your symptoms. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, which will reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. However, it’s important to understand that this is just treating the symptoms, not the underlying cause. I also recommend avoiding large meals, especially before bedtime, and elevating the head of your bed slightly. If your symptoms don’t improve with medication and lifestyle changes, or if they worsen, it’s crucial that you come back so we can consider those tests. Would you be willing to try the PPI and those lifestyle adjustments?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A pill is better than poking around inside me, that’s for sure. And I’ll try to eat less, though I make no promises. And I suppose I can elevate the bed a bit. But if this doesn't work, I'm not coming back. I have better things to do with my time than sit around and worry about my stomach. Just… write me the prescription, alright? And let’s be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I'm prescribing omeprazole, 20mg daily, to be taken 30 minutes before your first meal. It’s important to take it consistently for best results. Here’s the prescription. I'll also print out some information about GERD and lifestyle modifications for you. Please follow those recommendations as closely as possible. If you experience any side effects, or if your symptoms don’t improve within two weeks, please contact the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s enough for now. Just… keep it simple, alright? I appreciate you not sticking anything inside me. That’s all I ask. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And enjoy your gardening! Have a good day.
