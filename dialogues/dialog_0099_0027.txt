DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, it’s this… stuff. Coming up. Bad heartburn, mostly. It’s been happening for a while now, and frankly, I haven’t got all day to talk about it. Just want something to fix it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Stuff” coming up… and heartburn. Okay. Can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It’s food. Bits of food. And acid, probably. It happens when I lie down, mostly. After I eat. Big meals, especially. It’s… unpleasant. Honestly, is that really so hard to understand? I eat, I recline, things come back up. It’s basic physics, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, while I appreciate your… insights, Mr. Altine, there’s a bit more to it than gravity. How often would you say this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get technical with me. A couple times a week, maybe? Sometimes more if I’ve had a good dinner. You know, a real dinner. Not this…rabbit food everyone’s eating these days. Point is, it’s frequent enough to be annoying. And it’s getting worse. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Getting worse," you say. Can you describe the… sensation?
PATIENT: Sensation? It burns, obviously. Like fire going up my throat. And it tastes…sour. Like stomach stuff. And it’s…discomforting. Look, doc, I’m not a doctor, I don’t have the vocabulary for this. It feels bad. Is that good enough? Honestly, I thought you’d be asking about pills or something, not a description of my esophagus.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, pills are often the result of understanding the problem, Mr. Altine. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No. Not really. Food goes down fine. It's what happens after it goes down that’s the problem. It feels like there’s a… a flap somewhere that doesn’t close properly. Like a gate that won't latch. I don’t know. Just…things come back up. Is that clear enough for you? I really don’t enjoy detailing this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you experience any chest pain with this?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not really. Maybe a little…pressure sometimes. But I'm a big guy. I get pressure. It’s probably just…being me. It’s not like a stabbing pain or anything. Just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! Absolutely not. If anything, I've gained a few pounds. My wife keeps complaining about it. I like my food, doc. I don't lose weight. Now, are we getting anywhere with this or are we going to continue with a twenty questions game?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he regretted it every day. A terrible habit. No, I don’t smoke. And I certainly don't need a lecture about it. Now, what kind of medication are you thinking of giving me? Something strong, I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. A beer with the boys on a Saturday. Nothing excessive. I'm not a… a lush, if that's what you're implying. A responsible drinker. It helps with the digestion, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. Nothing serious. My blood pressure's a little high, the doctor said, but it's under control with pills. And I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t these days? Other than that, I’m in pretty good shape for my age.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little something for the arthritis when it flares up, ibuprofen. That’s it. I don’t like taking a lot of pills. Makes me feel sluggish. Now, can we get to the part where you tell me how to fix this heartburn?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Altine. It’s standard procedure. Can I listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just…be gentle. I haven't got a steel frame under here, you know. And don't take all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. Okay. A little tenderness in the epigastric region, but nothing acute. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I’m going to have you stand up and take a deep breath. I'm going to listen to your lungs again.
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it. Deep breath, you say? There. Happy now? Honestly, it's a bit undignified, all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me, and the brief physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease - GERD, commonly known as acid reflux. The tenderness in your upper abdomen supports that, as does the fact that it’s worse after eating and when you lie down. However, to rule out anything more serious, like an ulcer or esophageal inflammation, I’d like to order a few tests. A simple endoscopy to look at your esophagus and stomach, and a stool test to check for Helicobacter pylori infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? Like…sticking a camera down my throat? And a stool test? Absolutely not! Look, doc, I came here for a quick fix, not a full-blown investigation. I told you, it's just heartburn. It's what happens when you get older and enjoy a good meal! I don’t need a camera and…and samples! I think I'll just try some over-the-counter antacids. That's what my wife uses. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, I understand your reluctance, but refusing diagnostic testing means we can’t definitively rule out other conditions. While antacids may provide temporary relief, they won’t address the underlying cause. However, it is ultimately your decision. I strongly recommend you monitor your symptoms closely. If they worsen, if you experience difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, or notice blood in your stool or vomit, you must seek immediate medical attention. I will write you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor – a stronger medication than antacids – as a trial. If that doesn’t help within two weeks, I urge you to reconsider the endoscopy. Do you have any questions?
