DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I'm a family medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Lahn. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. I’ve been told before I have a funny heartbeat, atrial… something. It’s that that’s causing it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg and a history of an irregular heartbeat... that gives us a good starting point. The “atrial something” – do you remember what the doctor told you specifically?
PATIENT: To be honest, no, not really. It was a while ago, and doctors talk… well, they talk in a way that’s hard for me to follow sometimes. They said something about it being “fibrillating”, I think? And that it wasn’t too serious, but needed to be… kept an eye on. It was a specialist who told me, not my regular doctor. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Atrial fibrillation,” or AFib, is what they likely said. It's a common irregular heartbeat. And it's good you saw a specialist. Okay, let's focus on this leg swelling. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, I thought it was maybe from walking too much. But it’s gotten worse each day, I reckon. Now it’s quite noticeable, even with my shoes on. It doesn’t hurt terribly, but it’s… uncomfortable, and a bit heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, gradually worsening, and feeling heavy and uncomfortable. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing for long periods, or certain activities?
PATIENT: Well… I do a lot of walking, as I said. I teach computer science at the college, and the campus is quite large. I suppose being on my feet all day doesn’t help. And it feels a bit worse at the end of the day, after a long class. I haven't noticed it getting better with rest, though. It just… stays swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, swelling is worse with activity and doesn't really improve with rest. That's good information. Do you notice any redness or warmth to the leg along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t feel warm, and it looks… well, just swollen. Maybe a little bit paler than my other leg, but I’m not sure if I’m imagining that. I haven't noticed any pain in the leg, just the heaviness. It's not red, definitely not. I’d have noticed that, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no redness or warmth, just swelling and heaviness. Have you had any trouble breathing, or any chest pain recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been breathing alright, and no chest pain at all. I do get a bit… flustered sometimes when I’m explaining things, if that counts? But that’s just nerves, I think. My heart doesn’t feel funny, if that makes sense, even though the doctor said it was. It’s just the leg that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain or shortness of breath. It's good to hear your heart doesn't feel unusual. We'll definitely look into the AFib history, but right now, let's focus on the leg. I’d like to take a look at your leg and listen to your heart and lungs, if that's alright with you. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That sounds sensible. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on with my leg. It’s just a bit… worrying, you know? I haven’t had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your worry, Nixon. We'll do our best to figure this out. Okay, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first, and then I’ll examine your leg. Okay, I'm hearing an irregular heartbeat, which is consistent with your history of atrial fibrillation. It’s not a particularly fast rate right now, but definitely irregular. Your left leg is noticeably swollen compared to your right leg. There doesn't appear to be any significant tenderness when I press on it. The circumference is about 2 inches larger on your left leg than your right at the widest point. Your pulses feel normal in both feet. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems like we're dealing with swelling in your left leg, and it’s happening in the context of your known atrial fibrillation. While the swelling could be related to the AFib, we need to rule out other potential causes. I want to order a D-dimer blood test to check for blood clots, and I’d also like to do an EKG to get a clearer picture of your heart rhythm. Do you have any known allergies that I should be aware of before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. A D-dimer and an EKG… that sounds thorough. Is that going to be painful? I’m not terribly fond of needles, if I’m being honest. And what exactly is a D-dimer? I don’t suppose you could explain it in simple terms?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to ask, Nixon. It's good to be informed, and I'm happy to explain. The D-dimer is a blood test that checks for a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. It doesn't tell us if there’s a clot, but it can tell us if we need to investigate further. It's a pretty standard test, and the blood draw itself is usually quick. You'll feel a small pinch, but it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. The EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – it's a quick, painless test where we put some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles at all. It’s good to rule out a blood clot given the swelling and your history of AFib, as AFib can sometimes increase the risk of clots. We’ll start with these tests, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan to help you feel better. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Checking for a blood clot seems like a good idea. And no needles for the EKG, that’s a relief! A small pinch for the blood test… I can manage that. So, what happens after the tests? Will I get the results right away? And what if… what if they do find a clot? I’m probably worrying unnecessarily, but… it's just all a bit frightening, you know? I’ve never been properly ill before.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your worry, Nixon. It's perfectly natural to feel frightened when something new is happening with your health. We usually get the D-dimer results back within a few hours. The EKG results are available almost immediately. I'll review them as soon as they're ready and explain everything to you. If the D-dimer is elevated, it doesn't automatically mean you have a clot, but it will mean we need to do further imaging, like an ultrasound, to confirm. If a clot is found, the treatment usually involves blood thinners to prevent it from getting bigger and causing more problems. We would discuss the risks and benefits of those medications carefully. The good news is that blood clots are often treatable, and with the right care, most people make a full recovery. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll be here to answer all your questions and support you every step of the way. For now, let’s get those tests ordered and get the ball rolling. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and we’ll get you hooked up to the EKG machine shortly. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve put my mind at ease a bit. Thank you. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. Please just let me know when the nurse is ready, and I’ll go get my blood drawn. I hope I don't faint! I’m not the best with needles, as I said.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. And don't worry about fainting – we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Just let the nurse know if you’re feeling lightheaded at any point. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She’ll be in shortly.
