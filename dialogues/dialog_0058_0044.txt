DOCTOR: Right, so Calin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Calin Sachar. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… TodoroVICH, was it?
DOCTOR: TodoroVICH, yes. Though Dr. TodoroVICH is fine. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, I received a notice about… eligibility for home health or hospice care. I'm not entirely sure what that means for me, to be honest. I just want to understand if I qualify and what that would involve. I’m hoping you can explain things a bit.
DOCTOR: Home health or hospice… honestly, the paperwork people send out is ridiculous. You're 28, you look healthy enough. What made them even send you this notice?
PATIENT: That’s what I was wondering! I honestly didn’t think much of it until… well, my ex-husband handles all the bills and such since the divorce, and he just said it came in the mail. He wasn’t very clear. I've been feeling… a bit more tired than usual lately, I suppose, but I just figured it was stress. I work long hours at the pressers, you know? It’s physically demanding. I don’t know if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: "Stress." Right. Long hours at… pressers?
PATIENT: Yes, pressing clothes, mostly. For a dry cleaner. It’s… standing all day, lifting, a lot of repetitive movements. It can be hard on the body, honestly. I've been doing it for about seven years now, on and off. Is that… relevant? I’m sorry, I don’t mean to ramble. I just don’t really understand what this visit is about.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're tired from a physical job. That doesn’t automatically qualify you for home health, let alone hospice. Hospice is for… well, it's for people who aren’t expected to get better. You seem perfectly capable of standing here talking to me. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I definitely don’t think I’m… needing hospice! That sounds very serious. No, no, just the tiredness. And maybe a little bit of aches in my back and shoulders, but again, that’s just the work. I haven't been sick, no fever or anything like that. And I'm eating okay, I think. I haven't lost any weight, as far as I know. I really just want to know why I got this notice, and if there’s something I should be worried about. I feel a little silly even being here, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see… Okay, according to the system, you did have a brief hospitalization six months ago for… shortness of breath. That’s… not insignificant. Did anyone explain why you were hospitalized for shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that's right! I completely forgot about that. It was… I woke up one morning and I just couldn’t catch my breath. My chest felt really tight. They ran some tests at the hospital, and the doctor said it was… something with my lungs? I think they said it was a bad chest infection, maybe pneumonia? They gave me antibiotics and I felt better after a few days, and I haven’t had any trouble breathing since then. I honestly just put it down to a bad cold. No one really went into detail, to be honest. I was just relieved to be able to breathe again.
DOCTOR: "A bad cold?
PATIENT: Well, that’s what I thought. I mean, I get colds sometimes. It felt like a really bad one! It was the shortness of breath that was scary, but they said it was just pneumonia and gave me medication. I went home and recovered. I didn't think it was anything major, you see? It was six months ago, and I’ve been working fine ever since. Is that… unusual? Should I have followed up with someone? I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do, Doctor. I just want to be sure I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, the hospital records do indicate pneumonia, but there’s also a note about… a pulmonary embolism. That's a blood clot in your lung. It's significantly more serious than just pneumonia, and it requires ongoing monitoring. They discharged you with instructions to follow up with a pulmonologist, which you clearly haven’t done.
PATIENT: Oh… oh my goodness. A… a blood clot? I was not told that. Not at all. They just said pneumonia, gave me the antibiotics, and sent me home. No mention of a blood clot, or a pulmonologist, or… ongoing monitoring. I… I don’t know what to say. That sounds… very serious. I definitely haven’t followed up with anyone. I just assumed I was all better once the antibiotics finished. This is… very worrying. I feel a little faint, actually.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… concerning. It seems you were poorly informed at discharge. I’m going to order a D-dimer blood test and a chest X-ray to assess the situation. We need to rule out a recurrent clot. Honestly, this is why people need to advocate for themselves. Do you have any history of blood clots in your family?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn't really know my father. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had high blood pressure, but I don't think she ever had any blood clots. No one ever mentioned anything about that, either. I… I really don't know much about my family history, to be honest. I just assumed I was healthy. This is… a lot to take in. What happens if it is a clot? Is it serious? I'm getting quite worried now.
DOCTOR: Of course it's serious. A pulmonary embolism can be fatal. We’ll get the results of the tests back within a few hours. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to a pulmonologist. You need to see one immediately. And frankly, you should have asked more questions when you were discharged from the hospital. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I... I guess I just trusted the doctors at the hospital to tell me everything I needed to know. I never thought to ask questions. I just wanted to go home. This is… upsetting. I feel like I should have been told all this before. I just want to be okay. What does seeing a pulmonologist involve? Will they need to do more tests? I’m a little nervous about all of this now.
DOCTOR: They will likely order a CT scan of your chest and possibly a ventilation-perfusion scan to assess blood flow in your lungs. Depending on the results, you may need to be put on blood thinners. Look, I’m not going to hold your hand through this. You need to be proactive about your health. I’ve ordered the initial tests, and I’ve given you a referral. The pulmonologist will explain everything else. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you explaining things. Even though it’s… a lot to take in. I’ll make an appointment with the pulmonologist as soon as possible. .
