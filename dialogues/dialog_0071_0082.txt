DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, travel... something. My wife, she… she booked everything. I just… I just need to go. She always liked… far away places. I don’t really know where exactly, just… travel. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Hmm… travel, right. Okay. And you're feeling unwell because of the travel plans?
PATIENT: Unwell? No, no. Not… not sick. Just… worried, maybe. She did all the planning. Shots and… and stuff. I don’t remember what for. She said it was important. Important for… the place. A hot place, I think. With lots of… sand?
DOCTOR: Sand, and a hot place… okay. So, you've had some vaccinations, your wife arranged them, and you're feeling anxious about the trip itself?
PATIENT: Anxious… yeah, that’s a good word. She… she's gone now. So going… it’s hard. The shots, I didn’t even ask what they were for. Just… trusted her. She always knew best. Are they… important if I’m already… you know? Going without her.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's a lot to process, Odell, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It sounds like you’re understandably preoccupied. Let’s focus on the travel for now, and make sure you're as prepared as possible. Regarding the vaccinations… do you recall when you received them?
PATIENT: Uh… a few weeks ago, I think? Maybe last month? She took me to… a place near the market. A small room with… lots of needles. I don’t like needles. She held my hand. I… I don’t remember much else. Honestly. Everything’s a bit… blurry. Is it bad if I don’t remember?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all. It's perfectly understandable, especially given everything you've been through. Memory can be… unreliable. Let me check your record here… Ah, yes. It looks like you received a series of vaccinations on July 10th. Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Yellow Fever. Do those names ring any bells?
PATIENT: Yellow… like the color? And… typhoid sounds… awful. She didn't tell me what they were for, just that the place we were going… needed them. A hot place with… monkeys, I think she said. Is that… important? Like, is the monkey place dangerous? I don’t… I don’t do well with… things jumping on me.
DOCTOR: Monkeys… yes, that adds another piece to the puzzle. Those vaccinations are for protection against diseases you can contract in certain regions, particularly tropical areas with a higher risk of those illnesses. Yellow Fever, Typhoid… those can be serious. And monkeys can carry diseases, yes. It's good your wife had you vaccinated. Knowing where you're travelling to would be really helpful, Odell. Do you have any travel documents – a ticket, perhaps?
PATIENT: Ticket… uh… Here! She… she gave me this. It says… Kathmandu to… Iquitos? Peru? Is that… near the monkeys? I don’t… I don't know where anything is. She loved maps. I just… followed her.
DOCTOR: Kathmandu to Iquitos, Peru… yes, that is a tropical area, and known for its wildlife, including monkeys. It's also a region where Yellow Fever and other diseases are present. Okay. It looks like you're travelling to the Amazon rainforest. Odell, do you have any fever, chills, muscle aches, or headache currently?
PATIENT: Fever… no. I don't feel hot. Chills… it's a bit cold in here, maybe? I don’t know. Headache… sometimes. But I always get headaches. They don’t… mean anything. Just… stress, I guess. A lot of stress. Is… is Peru dangerous? Like, will I get sick from… the air? Or the monkeys?
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills currently, just a pre-existing headache. We'll keep that in mind. Peru itself isn't necessarily dangerous, but it does carry risks of certain illnesses. Mosquito-borne diseases are a concern, and as you mentioned, contact with wildlife. Have you noticed any rash, jaundice , or any changes in your urine or stool since your vaccinations?
PATIENT: Rash… no. I haven’t looked, really. I… I haven't been paying attention to… things like that. Jaundice? Like… yellow skin? No, I don’t think so. And… changes in… everything? I eat rice. Mostly. She always cooked the rice. I… I haven’t really noticed anything different. Is that… a bad sign? Should I be looking for yellow?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Odell. You're not doing anything wrong. It's understandable you haven’t been paying close attention. I’m just asking to rule things out. Jaundice is yellowing of the skin and eyes, and it can be a sign of liver problems, sometimes related to Hepatitis. Do you have any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Abdominal… pain? Sometimes. Just… a little upset stomach. I don't eat much these days. Everything tastes… wrong. She made it taste good. Nausea… a little, maybe. Especially in the mornings. And… I haven’t really… gotten rid of anything much lately. Just… tired. Mostly tired. Is that… the yellow fever? Is that what's making me tired?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some abdominal pain, nausea, changes in bowel habits, and fatigue. And you haven’t been feeling like yourself lately. It could be a number of things, Odell, and it's too early to say definitively if it's related to the vaccinations or a potential infection. Given your travel history and symptoms, I'd like to run some blood tests. It will help us check your liver function, look for any signs of infection, and rule out any serious complications. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests… More needles? I don’t… I really don’t like needles. But… if it helps… if it tells you what’s wrong… then okay. I just… I just want to get this over with. I want to… I just want to be done. Is it… a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you're hesitant, Odell. It’s not a lot of blood, just a few vials. It’s a standard procedure, and we’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s important to get this checked out, and this will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a malaria screening, just to be safe. We’ll also check your electrolyte levels. Let’s head down to the lab, and we’ll get this done. Afterward, we can talk about some supportive care to help you feel better. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Supportive care… like… what? Like… someone holding my hand? Just kidding. Mostly. Okay. Let’s just… get it over with. The needles, the blood… just… do it. And then… tell me what’s wrong. Please. I… I don't want to be sick in… the monkey place.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. We will. We’ll get these tests done quickly, and I’ll explain everything to you as soon as the results are available. And no, I won’t make you go to the monkey place if you're not feeling well. Let’s go to the lab, and then we can talk about managing your symptoms and keeping you comfortable. The nurse will be right with you, and they're very good at making the process as smooth as possible.
