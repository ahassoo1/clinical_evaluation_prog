DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Lahn. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as the paperwork indicates, I requested a general wellness check. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and my wife, Elena, insists I keep a close eye on things. I feel quite well, thankfully, but she believes in being proactive, and I respect that. I suppose it's best to be certain, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun. That’s very wise of both of you. Proactive care is excellent. A wellness check is a perfect way to do that. It's good to have a supportive partner looking out for you. Just to get a good overall picture, let’s start with a little bit about your current health. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that's been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. Truly. I wake up each morning with a bit of…well, the usual creaks and groans that come with age, but nothing I would call bothersome. No pain, no dizziness, no shortness of breath… I've been remarkably fortunate in that regard. I still enjoy my work, even though it is physical labor, and I have a good appetite. Elena keeps me well-fed, you see! I suppose I’m just hoping these lab results confirm what I already feel – that I’m in reasonably good shape for a man my age.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you're very active and taking good care of yourself. And having a good appetite is a very good sign! To get a more complete picture, let's go through a quick review of your past medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the history. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, maybe seven or eight years old, but I recovered fully. And about fifteen years ago, I pulled a muscle in my back while lifting a rather heavy beam at a construction site. The doctor – Dr. Ramirez, a very good man – treated it with physical therapy, and it healed up nicely, though I do need to be careful with my lifting now. Other than those two incidents, I've been remarkably healthy. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… I’ve always been a strong believer in staying active, you see. I suppose I'm quite lucky.
DOCTOR: You do sound very lucky, Mr. Mombrun, and staying active is a huge part of good health. That’s excellent that the physical therapy helped with your back. Now, about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My father… he suffered from high blood pressure in his later years. It was managed with medication, but it did require regular visits to the doctor. And my mother… she had arthritis, mostly in her hands. It bothered her quite a bit, especially in the cold weather. On Elena’s side…her brother had some issues with cholesterol, I believe, but he didn't take particularly good care of himself. He smoked, you see. I try to stay as far away from those habits as possible. Does that give you a good starting point?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Mombrun. Thank you. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a family history of cholesterol issues… that gives me a good sense of your potential risks. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I am aware. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, traveled to many different places…and thankfully, my system has always agreed with me. Elena always jokes that I have the stomach of a goat! I suppose I'm fortunate in that regard as well. No rashes, no swelling, no trouble breathing… nothing like that, ever.
DOCTOR: That's excellent news, Mr. Mombrun. A strong constitution is definitely a blessing! And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. I might take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that’s about it. I believe in letting food be my medicine, as they say. Elena, of course, tries to get me to take a multivitamin now and then, but I politely decline. I prefer to get my nutrients from a good, healthy diet. I eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And, well, Elena is an excellent cook! So, no, no medications, no supplements… just good food and a bit of sunshine.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like you're doing a lot of things right. Alright, so no known allergies, no medications… that's all very helpful. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. It shouldn't take too long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I have nothing to hide, and I trust your professional judgment. I understand it’s all part of ensuring good health. I've always believed in being thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to do a proper examination.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 130 over 80… that’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and activity level. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular…lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. I'm just going to check your reflexes now. Good reflexes on both sides…everything seems normal there as well. All right, everything sounds and looks good so far. Given your age, I'd like to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, cholesterol levels, and a thyroid test. Just to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning optimally. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A baseline is always a good idea, and I trust your judgment completely. The more information, the better, as they say. Elena will be pleased we’re being thorough. Please, proceed with the blood work. Where do I need to go? And are there any preparations I need to make beforehand – should I fast, or avoid anything in particular?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You’ll need to go to the lab just down the hall, room 203. The nurse will draw the samples. And yes, good question. For the most accurate results, please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw – that means no food or drinks other than water. You can take your usual medications with a small sip of water, if you take any, but let the lab technician know. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s quite clear. Twelve hours fasting…no food, just water. And inform the technician about any medications, even if it’s just a small aspirin. I think I have that all straight. Elena will make sure I comply! She’s quite meticulous about these things. So, after the blood work, when can I expect to hear back about the results? And will you contact me directly, or should I schedule a follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You can expect the results back in about 3 to 5 business days. The lab will automatically fax the results to my office. My nurse will review them, and she’ll contact you directly – either by phone or through the patient portal, whichever you prefer. She’ll let you know if anything requires further attention, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results in detail. Do you have a preference for how you'd like to be contacted?
PATIENT: Ah, that's very thoughtful of you, Doctor. I suppose a phone call would be best. I’m not particularly adept with these…patient portals, as they call them. Elena could manage it, but I prefer to handle these things myself, if you don’t mind. A phone call would be much appreciated. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any questions you have for me before I head off to the lab?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Mombrun, I think we’ve covered everything. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate you providing so much information. Just remember to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, and we'll be in touch once the results are back. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Otherwise, enjoy your day, and I look forward to discussing your results with you soon. Do you have any trouble walking to the lab, or would you like me to have someone escort you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you very much, but I am quite capable of walking to the lab myself. I still manage quite well, thankfully. I appreciate the offer, though. Thank you for your time and attention, Doctor Lahn. It’s been a pleasure meeting you and I feel much more reassured knowing we’re being proactive about my health. I’ll head off to the lab now. Have a pleasant day as well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. You take care, and we'll be in touch soon.
