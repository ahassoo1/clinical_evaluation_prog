DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good day to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. I believe it is the words. They… do not come so easily now. It is… frustrating, yes? I find myself… searching. It is difficult to explain, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words – that’s perfectly valid, and we can definitely explore that. Frustration is a very common feeling when this happens. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, you say? That is… a good question. It was… not sudden, no. More like… a slow fading, perhaps? It has been… some months, I think. Perhaps six? Or more? I am… not very good with dates, I must confess. It is… harder now than it was then, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over several months. That’s helpful. And is this difficulty with words constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… varies, yes. Some days are… better than others. When I am… relaxed, like now, it is… not so bad. But when I am… trying to explain something important, or… stressed, it becomes very difficult. It is… most noticeable then, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with stress or when you're trying to articulate something complex. That gives us a clue. And can you describe how the words are difficult?
PATIENT: Ah, that is… a tricky one. It is not that I do not know the word, you understand. It is… on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot… grasp it. It feels like… a name you almost remember, but… it dances away just as you reach for it. Sometimes, I use… the wrong word, and I know it is wrong, but… the correct one escapes me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tip of the tongue” phenomenon and occasional use of the wrong words. That's very descriptive, thank you. Do you find this difficulty affects your understanding of what people say to you, or is it mainly with expressing yourself?
PATIENT: No, no, my understanding is… fine. I can hear perfectly well, and I… comprehend what is said. It is… speaking that is the problem. I… know what I want to say, but… the words… do not cooperate. It is… quite embarrassing, at times, I must admit.
DOCTOR: I understand – it sounds incredibly frustrating, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel embarrassed. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… let me think. I… had a heart condition, some years ago. It was… managed with medication for a long time. And… my wife, God rest her soul, she… passed away two years ago. It was… a sudden illness. Other than that… I do not recall anything significant. I… have Medicare, if that is helpful?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherrell. The heart condition is good to know. And I'm very sorry for your loss. That must have been incredibly difficult. Medicare is helpful for billing, yes. Now, were you taking any medications for your heart condition, or are you currently on any medications at all?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medications… I was on… several, for many years. A small white pill, and a larger blue one, I believe. But… the doctor, a few years back, he said my heart was… stable enough to stop them. I stopped them… around the same time as my wife… it was all… a blur, truly. I am… not on any medications now, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, you were previously on medication for your heart condition but stopped them a few years ago. And currently, you’re not taking any medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see… I do not believe so, no. I… once had a rash from a… scented soap, many years ago. But that was… a long time ago, and it was… just a small irritation. Nothing serious, certainly. No… food allergies, no. I… enjoy a good apple, and I have no trouble with those.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies, just a mild reaction to scented soap in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – like stroke, dementia, or Parkinson’s – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Neurological… hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had… some memory problems in her later years. But the doctor said it was… just old age. My father… he was… a very healthy man. He lived to be… quite old. I do not… recall anyone with… Parkinson’s, no. It was… a long time ago, and I… do not remember very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, some memory issues in your mother, but no known history of Parkinson’s or stroke. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…hmm. Well, I am…retired now. I used to work in… compensation, benefits, and job analysis. Very…sedentary work, you understand. Now, I… mostly read. And… walk a little, when the weather is good. I live alone, now. It is… quiet. I… try to eat healthy, but… sometimes it is difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, used to be sedentary, now you read and walk when the weather permits, and live alone. I understand. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, never. I do not… drink alcohol. Never have. And… I certainly do not smoke. It is… a terrible habit. And… recreational drugs? No, never. I am… a very… ordinary man, you understand. I… prefer a good book and a quiet evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is… best. I… trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My… bones are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. Your reflexes are a little diminished but within normal limits for your age. Strength and coordination are good. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are a little quiet, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We'll check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and a complete blood count. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are… necessary, I am… happy to do them. Vitamin… B12, you say? Is that… important? I… eat a good diet, I believe. But… if it is best, then yes, please. I… trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Vitamin B12 is important for nerve function and can sometimes cause cognitive symptoms when it's low, even with a good diet, as absorption can decrease with age. So it's good to check. Okay, great. I’ll order those labs now. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d like to recommend some cognitive exercises to help sharpen your memory and word recall. There are apps and workbooks available, or we can discuss some simple techniques you can practice at home. Also, it's very important to stay socially active, if possible. Engaging in conversations and activities can help keep your mind stimulated. Would you be interested in learning more about these options?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very helpful. Cognitive exercises… and staying socially active. I… do not get out much, as you know. I… mostly read. Perhaps… some exercises would be beneficial. And… what kind of techniques can I practice at home? Anything… simple would be appreciated. I… do not want to overexert myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly understandable. A simple technique is to try and recall a list of items – maybe things in your kitchen or names of people you know. Start with a small list, like five items, and gradually increase it. Another is to describe everyday objects in as much detail as possible – focusing on their color, shape, texture, and function. You can also try reading aloud – it helps stimulate different parts of your brain. As for resources, there are apps like Lumosity and Elevate that offer brain training games. We can also look at some workbooks specifically designed for memory improvement. I can print out some information for you to take home. For now, let’s focus on those simple exercises and try to stay engaged as much as possible. We'll get the lab results back in a few days, and that will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I… do not think so. You have… explained everything very clearly. The exercises sound… manageable. And I… appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It is… frustrating, this difficulty with words, and… it is reassuring to know we are… taking steps to address it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It is frustrating, and you're right to want to address it. We'll work through this together. I'll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they'll schedule you for a blood draw. I’ll also print out those exercise suggestions and some information about staying socially active. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, staying positive and engaged is key. Here’s the information for the lab, and I’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is… all. Thank you again for your… kindness and patience. I… feel much better knowing we have a plan. I will… see you in a few days then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. It was my pleasure. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you then. .
