DOCTOR: Right, Aron Bulaong. 38 years old… Look, I’m a busy woman, so let’s just get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. My chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah. It’s my chest. It’s been hurting for… maybe a week now? It's hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. And is this pain… constant?
PATIENT: No, no. Not constant. Like… it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little ache, other times… it feels more… full? Like… heavy? I don't know how to explain. It's not sharp pain, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Full” and “heavy.” Alright. And where exactly in your chest are you feeling this?
PATIENT: Um… mostly… here. Like… under my… you know. My pecs? Both sides, kinda. Not in the middle, not… up high. Just… here. It's hard to show you, sorry.
DOCTOR: Well, try to be more precise. Is it worse with activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so. When I’m working on the roof… it feels more sore. Like, after climbing ladders and stuff. But when I’m just sitting, it’s okay. Not always, but… yeah. Worse when I work. It’s kinda hard to tell sometimes, ‘cause work is always… hard.
DOCTOR: Roofing, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. I’m a roofer. Been doing it for… a long time now. It’s good work, but… yeah. Lots of climbing. My wife… she worries about me, you know? Falls and stuff. But I’m careful. Mostly.
DOCTOR: And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Maybe… a little tired. But I’m always a little tired, from the work. No… no bumps, no… anything like that. Just the pain. And feeling… kinda worried, I guess. My wife told me to come. She said it’s better to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs and heart, just to rule things out. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is that good? It’s kinda hard to breathe deep, sometimes. The air feels… thin.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound… clear enough. Heart rate is… normal. A little fast, but that could be anxiety, or simply the exertion of talking. Any history of… let’s say, problems with your heart?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My family… they're all okay. No heart problems. My dad, he worked hard his whole life, too. Never had any trouble. I don’t… I don’t know much about heart stuff, to be honest. I just climb roofs.
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing bad. Just a little… sneezing. Nothing that stops me from working. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My wife… she's the one with allergies. She's always sneezing. Not me.
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: No. I don't take any. Never needed any. Just… sometimes a little painkiller for my back after a long day. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it sounds like musculoskeletal pain. Likely strained muscles from the roofing work. I'm going to prescribe you some ibuprofen. Take it as directed. If it doesn't improve in a week, or gets worse, then… then you can come back. And try to be careful on those roofs. It’s not worth risking your health. Next patient.
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen. A week. And be careful. I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
