DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My name is Lindra. It is good to meet you. I… my family, they want me to go to a place. A place for old people. They say I need… check, to make sure I can go. For the place.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your family would like you to have a medical evaluation to determine if you're able to safely transition to a care facility. That's very sensible. Let me pull up your chart here… Lindra Abdollahi, age 72. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit more about why your family feels this is the right time for a care facility?
PATIENT: They say… I forget things. Sometimes. Not big things, but… where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for lunch. Little things. My husband, he does a lot for me now. They worry. He worries. It is… hard for him.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like there's been a change in your memory, and your husband is understandably concerned. That’s a very common reason for families to consider this type of evaluation. When did you and your husband start noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… six months? A little longer? It was after my birthday, I think. Everything was okay before that. I remember. But then… things started to feel… not so clear. It is hard to say exactly. Time… it goes fast.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when these things start. Six months is helpful to know. And are these memory issues getting worse over those six months?
PATIENT: Yes. I think so. At first, it was just the glasses. Or forgetting a name. Now… now I worry I forget what my grandson’s name is. Sometimes. Not always. But it scares me.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's concerning, and it’s good you’re recognizing that. We definitely want to investigate this further. Besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… I get tired. Very tired. Even after a long nap. And… sometimes I feel… confused. Like I don’t know where I am for a little while. It goes away, but… it is scary when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and periods of confusion are important to note. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite, sleep, or mood?
PATIENT: I eat… not so much anymore. My husband, he makes me try, but… it doesn’t taste the same. Sleep is okay. I sleep. But I wake up a lot. And… I get sad sometimes. Very sad. But I try to be happy. For my family.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so open with me, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like there are several things going on. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never have. Just… a little tea sometimes. For sleep. But it doesn’t really help. No allergies. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment – just some simple balance and memory tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That is… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Balance… I hope I can do that. My legs… they are not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take it slow. If you'll just have a seat here, we can start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then we'll move on to the other tests. First, let's just get comfortable. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Oh… the year? That is… hard. Let me think. Is it… 2023? No. 2024? I… I am not sure. It is August, yes? I know it is August. But the year… it slips my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. It's common to have some difficulty with recall. We'll take our time. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but that's not uncommon at your age. Lungs are clear, good air entry. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes. I can do that. Is this… good? My eyes… they get tired easily. But I am following. I think.
DOCTOR: You’re doing very well. Good, good. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Please try to remember them, as I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. I remember. Apple, table, penny. Is that… good? I am trying very hard.
DOCTOR: Very good! Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly, and try to stand with your feet together, and your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh… It is hard. My legs… they are not steady. I feel… like I am going to fall. I need to hold onto something. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. Safety first. Please hold onto my arm. That’s perfectly alright. Just try to hold still for a moment.
PATIENT: It is… hard to stay still. I feel… dizzy. Maybe I should sit down. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's definitely sit down. That’s much better. Now, do you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm… apple… and… table… I… I can’t remember the third one. I am so sorry. It is… gone. My memory… it is not good.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. It's not a test to pass or fail, Ms. Abdollahi, it just helps me understand what’s going on. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam we’ve done, there are several possibilities we need to explore. These symptoms – memory loss, fatigue, confusion, balance issues – could be caused by several things, including vitamin deficiencies, a urinary tract infection, medication side effects , or early signs of dementia. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a thyroid test. I also want to order a urinalysis to rule out an infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work… urine… yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know what is happening. And… if I can still take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'm going to write you a lab requisition form. You can take this to the lab downstairs, and they’ll draw the blood and collect a urine sample. They're open until 5 pm today. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. How does next Tuesday at 10 am sound?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday… 10 am. Yes. That is… good. I will be here. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I feel… a little better just knowing we are doing something.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I understand it can be worrying when you don’t know what's going on, but we're going to take things one step at a time. Here's the requisition form. And please, if you experience any worsening symptoms – a high fever, severe confusion, difficulty walking – don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think… no. You have explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… please let me know what is happening as soon as you know. I worry about my family. I don’t want to be a burden.
