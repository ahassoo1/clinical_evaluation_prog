DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s just… lab work. The usual, I suppose. Medicare said I needed it done. I don’t really feel sick or anything. Just trying to get it over with, if you know what I mean. It’s… a long story why I’m here, but it mostly involves paperwork.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, yes. Well, we still need to go through the motions, even if you're feeling alright. Just to have a baseline, you know?
PATIENT: Baseline… right. I keep forgetting things these days. What kind of lab work are we talking about, exactly? I don’t recall being told anything specific. Just… “lab work.” Is it blood? I don’t love needles, if I’m being honest. Not a fan.
DOCTOR: Medicare usually orders a Complete Blood Count, a Basic Metabolic Panel, lipid panel, and a urinalysis for folks your age, Mr. Croonquist. Yes, it will involve blood work, and a urine sample. Standard stuff. Have you had any blood work done recently – within the last six months, perhaps?
PATIENT: Six months… hmm. That's a good question. I… really can’t say. I see a lot of doctors, you know? It all sort of blurs together after a while. Maybe? Possibly? I really wish I kept better track of these things. Is it important that I remember? It feels like a lifetime ago, honestly. A long, blurry lifetime.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Mr. Croonquist. It helps us avoid unnecessary repeats. But alright, we’ll proceed as if this is your first time in a while. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… Now that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to travel a lot, you see, and I tried everything. Maybe a bit of a stomach upset here and there, but nothing serious. Does dust count? I sneeze a lot, but I think that’s just… dust. I don’t carry an EpiPen or anything. Honestly, I’m probably fine. Just… don’t give me anything with nuts, just to be safe? I hear about those allergies. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, avoiding nuts as a precaution. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… That’s another tricky one. Let me think. I take something for my… uh… what was it for again? Oh, right! For my waterworks. Helps me… go. A little blue pill, I think. And sometimes, when my… joints act up, I take something for that too. A white one. I get them from the pharmacy down the street. That’s about it, I think. It’s… hard to keep track, honestly. I get refills when they run out. Do you need the names? I don’t have the bottles with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try to narrow this down. The blue pill for your “waterworks” – do you remember what the pharmacist told you it was for?
PATIENT: Hmm. Something about… an enlarged… prostate? Is that right? It was something big and scary-sounding. They said it would help me… sleep better at night, too. It's small, the pill. Very small. I've been taking it for… years, I suppose. A long time. Is that helpful? I really wish I wrote these things down. I'm a terrible patient, I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, sounds like Tamsulosin, likely for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. And the white pill for your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, that one. I honestly can’t recall. It came in a little orange bottle, I think? Maybe. It was something for the… the achiness. You know, when it rains? Or when it’s cold? Just to take the edge off. I don't take it every day, just when it's bad. I get it filled with the same pharmacist, he knows me well. He probably knows what I'm taking better than I do. I'm sorry I'm not more helpful. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We'll try to get this sorted out. I’m going to need to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. Can you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Right. Well, alright. As long as it's quick. I don't have a lot of time today, you understand. And please, be gentle. My joints aren't what they used to be. I'm… not a fan of being poked and prodded. Here we go… Is this thing accurate? I haven’t weighed myself in ages.
DOCTOR: 69 kilograms. And your height is on file as 195 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: 195… yeah, that sounds right. I haven’t shrunk too much yet, thankfully. My father was a tall man, you know. Very tall. Is that… relevant? I always feel like I have to explain my height. It’s just… I'm a big fellow. Can we just get this over with? I have an appointment later, and I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll check your abdomen. It’s standard, and it shouldn’t take long. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… cold. And hard. Not very comfortable. Deep breath… Is that thing cold? It feels very cold on my chest. And try to be quick, Doctor. I'm not a fan of doctors, you know. Always poking and prodding. Is that it? Can I get up now? I'm starting to feel a bit stiff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Just a little. It’s always a bit tender. I think it's just… old age. And maybe the food. I eat a lot, you know. It's probably just gas. Or something. Is that bad? Should I be worried? Please don't tell me I need surgery. I hate hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright, mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. No significant guarding or rebound. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Please relax your legs. And the other leg…
PATIENT: Ow! That’s… unexpected. And a bit painful, actually. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. Arthritis, probably. Is that normal? Did you have to hit me that hard? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. It’s just making me feel worse. Can we just get to the lab work now? Please? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. Reflexes are diminished, which is consistent with age. Now, let's get this lab work done. We'll need a blood sample and a urine sample. The nurse will be in shortly to take care of that. I'm going to order a CBC, BMP, lipid panel, and urinalysis. And given the murmur, I'm also going to order an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. It's just standard procedure, Mr. Croonquist. We'll get this all sorted out.
PATIENT: More tests… Of course. More poking and prodding. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. Just… please hurry. The faster we get this done, the faster I can leave. And please tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins are… sensitive. And I really, really don’t like needles. .
