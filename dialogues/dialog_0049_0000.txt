DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… my legs. They just feel weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not a fun one, let me tell you. Now, getting up and walking... it's just not as easy as it used to be. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Weakness… and it began after a cold, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A cold. Not just a cold, a proper one with everything – the cough, the sniffles, the whole bit. I was down for almost a week. And then, as soon as I started feeling better, my legs just… gave way a little. Not completely, mind you, but enough to make me worry. It’s just… odd timing, isn’t it? Like something else took advantage while I was already feeling terrible.
DOCTOR: Odd timing, perhaps. And can you describe this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a sudden collapse, Doctor, don't get me wrong. It's just… when I try to stand, it takes more effort. Like there’s no spring in my step, you know? And walking any distance feels… heavy. And truthfully, it's mostly in both legs. It's not like one is dramatically worse than the other. It's…symmetrical, I think that’s the word. Honestly, I expected it to just go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Symmetrical weakness… after a viral illness. And it hasn't improved. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, no fever now, thankfully. And the cough is pretty much gone. Just a little tired, to be honest. But I always get tired easily. That’s probably just… me. I don't know. And I haven’t noticed any numbness or tingling. Nothing like that. Just the… weakness. It’s rather frustrating, to be perfectly frank. I have a tour scheduled next week and I need to be on my feet all day. It’s hardly ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any pain associated with this weakness?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Not like a sharp pain, or anything like that. Maybe a little… achiness in my thighs after I’ve been walking for a bit. But it’s not constant, and it’s not terrible. Honestly, it feels more like… a heavy feeling, if that makes any sense. Like I’m carrying weights on my legs. It’s hard to explain. I really just wish they'd get back to normal. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever experienced.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. We’ll need to do a brief physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Though, I must warn you, it's not the most graceful sight at the moment. There. As you can see, it takes a bit of effort. It’s… not what it used to be. I always prided myself on my balance, you know, for leading tours and all. I really do hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please walk a few steps for me. And I'm going to check your reflexes and strength. Okay, push against my hands... Now the other leg… Good. Now, stand on your heels… and now on your toes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your strength is…slightly reduced, but not significantly. I’m not seeing anything particularly alarming at this point, but we need to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes? That doesn't sound good, does it? I always thought reflexes were supposed to be…strong. Well, if you say it's not alarming, that’s something, I suppose. What things are we ruling out, exactly? I’d rather know what I’m dealing with. Honestly, it's just unnerving when things aren’t working properly. Especially when it involves my legs! I rely on those, you know.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. Reflexes can be affected by many things, including the recent illness. We need to rule out nerve damage, vitamin deficiencies – particularly vitamin D and B12 – and, less likely, but we must consider it, a more serious neurological condition. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a creatine kinase to check for muscle inflammation. And, just to be thorough, an MRI of your lumbar spine. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh, goodness. That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? I mean, a lumbar spine MRI? Is it really necessary? I just had a cold, Doctor! I thought you said it wasn’t anything alarming. And all those tests… I don’t even know where to begin. Honestly, it's sounding more complicated than I anticipated. Vitamin deficiencies? I eat a perfectly balanced diet, or at least I try to. I suppose if you insist… but I do hope it’s nothing major. It just feels… excessive for a bit of leg weakness.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns. However, it’s my professional responsibility to rule out all possibilities, even unlikely ones. It's better to be thorough. While a simple cold is the most likely cause, this weakness persisting after recovery warrants further investigation. The MRI will help us visualize the spinal cord and rule out any structural problems. And yes, vitamin deficiencies can occur even with a seemingly balanced diet – absorption issues are common. Here are the lab orders, and this is a referral for an MRI. The lab is just down the hall, and the MRI center is a short drive away. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: I suppose not. Though I still maintain it's a bit much, honestly. All this for a bit of leg weakness. Fine, I’ll get the tests done. But I expect a clear explanation of everything, Doctor. And I really hope it’s just some simple deficiency or leftover effect of the cold. I have a tour group expecting me next week, you know. This is very inconvenient. Very inconvenient indeed. Is there anything else, or can I go get these tests done now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that will be all, Ms. Firestone. The lab technician will guide you through the process. And please, try not to worry excessively. .
