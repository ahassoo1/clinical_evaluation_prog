DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep. It’s hard to explain, really. Feels like… something’s tight. I don't remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Things aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Tightness” is a good way to describe it. And it’s okay that you don't remember exactly when it started. We can sort through it. So, this pain when you breathe deep… where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Hmm… around here. Not… sharp, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It’s… hard to pinpoint. I used to do a lot of building, you know. Construction. Maybe it’s something from that? I don’t know. A long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, around your right chest. And not sharp, more of an uncomfortable feeling. Construction work… that's helpful information. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Has this discomfort been getting worse, better, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Or maybe… more noticeable? It comes and goes. Some days I barely feel it. Other days… well, like today. It makes me… tired, too. I don’t have the energy for much anymore. I try to help my daughter with things around the house, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates – some days better, some days worse, and today is a worse day. And it's making you feel tired. That’s important to know. Have you noticed anything that specifically makes it worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… Going up stairs, definitely. And… lifting things. Even small things sometimes. It's silly, really. I used to be able to lift anything. I don’t know what’s changed. Doctor, is this something serious? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mr. Ruocco, and you’re not a bother. It's good you're telling me all of this. Stairs and lifting things make it worse… that gives us more clues. Let's do a quick exam, if you don’t mind, just to listen to your lungs and heart and get a better feel for things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I don't like feeling like I can't do things. I hope it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. And one more. Okay, now I’m going to palpate your chest, just to check for any tenderness. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds on the right side, where you’re feeling the discomfort. Not drastically diminished, but less than on the left. There’s a slight tenderness to palpation there as well. Your heart rate is regular, but a little elevated at 88. I’d like to get a chest x-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I’ve never had one before, I don’t think. Or maybe I did… it’s hard to remember. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick procedure, Mr. Ruocco, and it doesn’t hurt. You’ll stand in front of a special machine, and a technician will take a picture of your chest. It’s completely painless – just a brief exposure to radiation, but a very small dose. It takes just a few minutes. While we wait for the results, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That’s… a long time ago. I used to be pretty healthy. Worked hard all my life. I had some trouble with my blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? The doctor put me on some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn’t like feeling… sluggish. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a roof. Besides that… not much. I don’t think. I don't really go to the doctor much. My daughter worries about me, though. She says I should take better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some blood pressure issues in the past, and a broken wrist. And you've generally been pretty healthy. It's good to know you've been healthy for most of your life. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with pills before, as far as I remember. But like I said, I don't take much. I prefer to just tough things out. I used to get a rash sometimes when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. It was probably just poison ivy. Is that what you mean? It doesn’t feel like allergies now, though. Just… tired, and tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just the occasional rash as a child. That’s helpful to know. Now, while we wait for the x-ray results, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to. A few cigarettes now and then, but I always told her to quit. She finally did, years ago. It was bad for her health, you see. I try to be careful about things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Never smoked. And your wife used to, but she quit. That's excellent. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little. Sometimes, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Nothing much. It helps me relax, you know? It’s not every day, though. Mostly on weekends. I don’t go out to bars or anything. Just at home, with my food. It's a habit, I guess. My wife used to drink with me. But she…
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That’s good to know. And lastly, do you do any regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… Well, I used to. Building things was exercise, you know? Carrying lumber, climbing roofs… But now… not so much. I try to walk around the house a bit, help my daughter with things. But it gets harder every day. That’s why I’m here, Doctor. I just want to feel like I can do things again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. You want to get back to doing the things you enjoy. Let's see what the x-ray shows. Okay… the x-ray shows some decreased lung volume on the right side, and a small area of consolidation in the lower lobe. This could be due to a number of things, but most likely it indicates some pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in your lungs. Given your age and your symptoms, this is a possibility we need to address. The good news is it’s treatable. Do you have a fever, or have you been running a temperature?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… Oh dear. I don't know… fever? I haven’t checked. I haven’t been feeling well enough to bother with a thermometer. I just feel… tired. And weak. And a little achy. But I figured it was just my age catching up with me. Achy… yes, I’ve been achy. But no shivering or anything like that. This sounds… serious. Is it contagious? My daughter comes to visit, you know. I don't want to get her sick.
DOCTOR: It’s good you told me about your daughter. Pneumonia can be contagious, but with appropriate treatment – antibiotics – it’s much less likely to spread. The antibiotics will help clear up the infection and reduce the risk of transmission. It sounds like you have some mild symptoms, so we caught it relatively early. Given your age and these findings, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics – azithromycin. It’s a five-day course. I also recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and avoiding strenuous activity. I want you to follow up with me in three days to see how you're responding to the medication. And if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please come back immediately, or go to the emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… alright. Five days. Rest and fluids. I can do that. Three days for a follow-up. And come back if it gets worse. Okay, I can remember that. But Doctor… I don't have insurance, you see. Will this be… expensive? I’m worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Ruocco. That’s a valid concern. Let me check to see if there are any patient assistance programs available for the azithromycin. Also, we can discuss options for managing the cost of the follow-up visit. We work with several local charities that may be able to provide assistance. I don't want you to delay treatment because of financial concerns. Okay, it looks like there is a program that can significantly reduce the cost of the antibiotic. And we can schedule your follow-up visit for a time when our nurse practitioner is available, as her consultation fee is lower. We’ll do everything we can to make this affordable for you. In the meantime, do you have any questions about the medication itself – side effects, how to take it, anything like that?
PATIENT: That… that’s a relief, Doctor. Thank you. A program… and the nurse practitioner… that’s very kind of you. Side effects… hmm. I don’t know… what should I look out for? I get a little dizzy sometimes, even without medicine. And my stomach isn’t what it used to be. Should I take it with food? I just want to make sure I do everything right. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I’m glad I could help. Azithromycin can sometimes cause nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. Taking it with food can help minimize those side effects. It can also rarely cause dizziness, so if you experience that, please be careful when standing up. If you experience any severe side effects – difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a rash – stop taking the medication and come back immediately. Here's a written prescription and information sheet about the azithromycin, including potential side effects. Also, here’s a note for your daughter explaining your diagnosis and the importance of resting and avoiding spreading germs. And here's the appointment card for your follow-up visit in three days. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your kindness, and for helping me with the cost. I'll try to get some rest, and I'll be careful. Thank you again, Doctor Piet. I think I’ll just go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in three days. .
