DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I just moved here. I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? My husband said something about it... Medicare and all that. I don't really... remember everything. It's all kinda new.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Getting settled in a new place can be a lot, and it's smart to establish care with a primary doctor. It sounds like you're doing the right thing. And yes, Medicare is a good first step. So, to start, let's just get some basic information down. You mentioned you just moved here—do you have a general idea of where you moved from?
PATIENT: Um... somewhere up north, I think? It was... colder. Lots of trees and water. I grew up there, with my family. It was a small town. I… don't remember the name, sorry. It's kinda embarrassing. My husband usually knows stuff like that.
DOCTOR: No need to be embarrassed at all, Emileigh. Sometimes those details are just… harder to recall. That's perfectly normal. "Somewhere up north" gives me a general idea. And you mentioned growing up with your family there. Are they still in that area?
PATIENT: Yeah, most of 'em are. My mom and dad, and my sister. I talk to them on the phone sometimes. My brother... he moved away a long time ago. I think he's in the city, but I don't really know where. Things get... fuzzy. I just remember being with them, you know? Like, happy times.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you have a close family, which is wonderful. Now, thinking about your health specifically – and feel free to tell me if anything is difficult to remember – have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Um... not that I remember. I broke my arm once when I was little, climbing a tree. And I think I had… the chickenpox? But that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. I'm usually pretty healthy. I mean, I work, so I'm moving around all the time. Does that count? I do kinda get tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A broken arm as a child and possibly chickenpox – we can document those. And yes, staying active at work certainly contributes to good health. You mentioned getting tired sometimes. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um... it's just... like, at the end of the day. I feel really worn out. And sometimes even during the day, if I've been working hard on something. It's not, like, sick tired, just... really, really tired. I usually just sit down and rest for a bit. It helps, I guess. But it's been happening more lately, maybe? I don’t really know. Everything feels kinda… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, increased fatigue, especially at the end of the day and sometimes during work, and it seems to be getting more frequent. It’s good you’re recognizing that change. To get a better picture, can you describe what your work is like?
PATIENT: Um... I'm a technician. I fix things. Machines and stuff. Lots of... wires and gears and... computers. I mostly work with other people, building things or taking them apart. It's kinda... hands-on. Sometimes it's loud, sometimes it's quiet. It's... complicated. I like it, usually. But it can be stressful if something isn't working right. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. A technician—that sounds challenging and requires a lot of focus. It’s easy to get stressed when things aren’t working as they should. Now, when you say "tired," is it just physical tiredness, like your muscles feel weak?
PATIENT: Um... not really. It's... more in my head, I think. Like, I can't concentrate as well. I forget things easier. And I feel kinda… down sometimes. Not sad, exactly, just... not myself. I just wanna sit and not think about anything. Does that sound weird? My husband says I've been quieter lately, too.
DOCTOR: No, Emileigh, that doesn’t sound weird at all. That sounds like more than just physical fatigue. Difficulty concentrating, increased forgetfulness, feeling "down" or not yourself—those are important things to note. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to ask a few questions about other things, just to make sure we're not missing anything. Are you okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. I mean, I don't really mind. I just... I hope it's nothing serious. I just wanna feel normal again. Whatever "normal" is, I guess. I just... I don't remember things being this hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll take things one step at a time. It's good you're recognizing these changes, and we'll work together to figure things out. First, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um... not really. I used to take something for headaches, but I stopped a long time ago. It didn't really help much. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I hurt my back from work, but that's it. No vitamins or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, but I don't always have time. My husband takes a lot of stuff, but I don't really pay attention to what it is. He's got... problems with his knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen for back pain, and your husband has some knee issues. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um... not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm outside, but I think that's just the bugs. My husband is allergic to... something with cats, I think. He sneezes a lot when we visit his sister's house. But I'm fine. I like cats.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies for you, and your husband has a cat allergy. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your past medical history… Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um... no, I don't think so. I've never been told I have anything like that. I get check-ups sometimes, but the doctors always just say I'm fine. I mean, I used to get really bad migraines when I was younger, but they stopped a long time ago. I haven't seen a doctor in a while, actually. I guess I just... didn't need to. My husband handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of migraines that have resolved, and you haven't seen a doctor recently. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Um... no, not really. I broke my arm when I was little, but I don't think I was hospitalized. I just had a cast on it for a few weeks. And I think I got stitches once when I was a kid, but it wasn't a big deal. Nothing serious, I promise. My husband had his appendix out a long time ago, but that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a child, possibly stitches, and your husband had his appendix removed. Nothing major for you personally. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Um... that's a hard one. My grandma had... something with her heart, I think. And my uncle had cancer, a long time ago. He... he didn't make it. And my mom... she gets really sad sometimes. She's always kinda down, but she doesn't really talk about it. I think my dad has high blood pressure, but I'm not sure. Everyone just kinda... keeps to themselves. It's hard to remember everything. I feel bad. I should probably ask more questions.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh. It's completely understandable that it's hard to remember everything, especially when families don't always openly discuss these things. You’re not to blame at all. So, a family history of heart issues, cancer, and potentially high blood pressure, and your mother experiences periods of sadness. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Um... no, none of that. Never really liked it. My husband drinks sometimes, when he's watching sports, but not a lot. And he definitely doesn't do drugs. We're pretty healthy, I think. We just work a lot. And try to sleep when we can. It's hard to get good sleep, though. I worry a lot, I guess. That keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drug use. And your husband drinks occasionally. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social situation. Are you currently employed, and if so, what do you do?
PATIENT: Yeah, I told you, I'm a technician. I work at the factory, building machines. It's… okay. The people are nice, mostly. Long hours, though. And it can be really stressful when things go wrong. My husband works at the office, he does… numbers, I think. He's good at that stuff. We don't see a lot of people outside of work, really. It's just us two, mostly. Sometimes we visit my family, but they live pretty far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're a technician at the factory, and your husband works in an office. So, you both have demanding jobs. Alright, Emileigh, that gives me a good overview of your medical history, family history, and lifestyle. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I hope you can figure out what's wrong. I just wanna feel like myself again. It's been… hard. I just don't want this to keep going. What will the exam be like? Will it hurt? I'm kinda scared, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Emileigh, and it’s perfectly okay to be scared. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It won't be painful, I promise. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll palpate your abdomen – that means gently feeling your belly – to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. And finally, I'll do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, okay. That doesn't sound too bad. As long as it doesn't hurt. And you'll tell me what you're doing as you go? I get kinda anxious if I don't know what's happening. Just… please be gentle? And if I start to feel weird, can I tell you to stop? I just… I don't do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. I will explain every step as I go, and I promise to be gentle. And yes, absolutely you can tell me to stop at any time if you start to feel uncomfortable or anxious. Your comfort is my top priority. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to relax. It’s kinda hard, though. I always get nervous at the doctor. It feels kinda tight. Is that normal? What number are you looking for? I always forget… is high bad? I get so confused.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal, Emileigh. Many people feel nervous at the doctor, so you're not alone. The tightness is just from the cuff inflating – it will only last for a few seconds. As for the numbers, we're looking for two numbers. The top number is your systolic pressure, which is the pressure when your heart beats. The bottom number is your diastolic pressure, which is the pressure when your heart rests between beats. A normal reading is generally considered to be around 120/80, but it can vary depending on the person. Okay, your blood pressure is 135/90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. It could be slightly higher just because you’re nervous. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. I'm just going to listen on your chest with this. It's cool, and it won't hurt.
PATIENT: Okay… I’ll try to breathe normally. It’s kinda cold. Is it… clean? I always worry about germs. Okay, go ahead. Just… try not to poke me. I don’t like being poked.
DOCTOR: It's clean, Emileigh, I assure you. We sterilize it after each use. And I’ll be very gentle – no poking, I promise. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs for any unusual sounds. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears. I’m just going to use this light to see if there’s any wax buildup or infection. It might feel a little cool.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s kinda weird. It feels cold and… pointy. Is there something in there? I always get ear infections when I was little. My mom used to put… drops in my ears. It smelled funny. Just… hurry, please? I don’t like things in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a moment. Your ears look clear, Emileigh. No signs of infection or wax buildup. They’re perfectly healthy. Now, I'm just going to take a look in your nose and throat. I’ll use the light again, and I’ll gently depress your tongue to get a better view. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it won't hurt.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s kinda gross. It feels weird. Is my throat red? I think I’ve been kinda stuffy lately, but I didn’t think anything of it. It tickles. Just… try not to poke my tongue. I always gag when someone touches my tongue.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a moment. Your throat is a little red, but that’s not uncommon, especially with a little stuffiness. It doesn’t look like a full-blown infection. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. That just means I'm going to gently feel your belly to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s kinda weird. It feels… empty. Does my stomach feel okay? I’ve been kinda bloated lately, but I thought it was just from eating too much. Don’t press too hard. It tickles. I think I need to pee.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a moment. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. It sounds like it could be bloating, as you suspected. Alright, Emileigh, that completes the physical exam. You do mention needing to urinate, so you are welcome to use the restroom. Based on the exam, and what you've told me, everything seems relatively normal. But your slightly elevated blood pressure and fatigue are worth investigating further. I think we should order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to feel normal again. I don’t like feeling tired all the time. What kind of blood work? Will it hurt? How long will it take? And… will it show if something’s really wrong? I get scared, you know? I just… I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Emileigh, and it’s perfectly okay to be scared. We’ll take everything one step at a time. The blood work will involve taking a small sample of your blood – it will just be a quick prick with a needle, and it shouldn’t hurt much more than a mosquito bite. A phlebotomist will draw the blood, and it will only take a few minutes. We’ll be checking for a variety of things – your complete blood count to look at your red and white blood cells, your thyroid function to rule out any thyroid issues, your vitamin levels to see if you’re deficient in anything, and some basic metabolic panels to check your kidney and liver function. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss them together and determine the best course of action. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and determine the cause of your fatigue and slightly elevated blood pressure. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it will give us valuable information to work with. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… I think so. It’s just… a lot. So, it’s just a little prick? And it will tell you if something’s wrong with my… insides? My mom always said I have a sensitive stomach. What if it is something bad? Will I have to take… medicine? Or have surgery? I get really scared when I think about surgery.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Emileigh, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and scared. Take a deep breath. Yes, it’s just a quick prick with a needle. And the blood work will help us look at what’s going on inside your body, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something bad happening. Most of the time, blood work comes back normal, or with minor issues that can be easily treated. And even if there is something going on, it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll need surgery. There are many different treatment options available, and medicine is often the first step. Surgery is usually reserved for more serious cases, and we would discuss all of your options thoroughly before making any decisions. Right now, we’re just gathering information. Let’s get the blood work done first, and then we can talk about the results and what they mean. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I promise to be here to support you every step of the way. I won't let you go through this alone. Would you like me to call a nurse in to explain the blood draw procedure, and answer any questions you might have?
PATIENT: Yeah… that would be nice. I think I need someone else to explain it. I get really nervous around needles. And… what if I faint? I’ve almost fainted before when I got my blood drawn. Just… please make sure I don’t faint. I get really embarrassed when I faint.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. We’ll definitely have a nurse come in and explain the procedure, and they can stay with you during the blood draw to make sure you’re comfortable. And don’t worry about fainting – it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious around needles, and we’ll take all the necessary precautions to prevent that from happening. You can lie down during the blood draw if you’d like, and the nurse can monitor your blood pressure and pulse. We’ll also make sure you have something to eat or drink beforehand to keep your blood sugar stable. I’ll let the nurse know about your anxieties, and they’ll be prepared to provide extra support. Just take a few deep breaths, and remember that you’re not alone. We’ll get through this together. Just focus on your breathing for now, and I'll be right here when the nurse arrives. Is there anything else I can do for you at the moment?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s okay. Just… please don’t leave me alone. I get really scared when I’m by myself. And… thank you. For being nice. It’s hard to explain, but… I don’t usually get this kind of… help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. I won't leave you alone. That's what I'm here for. I understand it can be difficult to explain, and you don't need to. It’s perfectly okay to feel scared and overwhelmed, and I’m glad I can provide some support. We’ll stay here together until the nurse arrives, and we'll take things one step at a time. Just focus on your breathing, and remember that you’re not alone. Now, let's just take a moment to relax. Is there anything I can get you—a glass of water, a tissue?
PATIENT: Um… a tissue, please. And maybe just… hold my hand for a little bit? I get really shaky when I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. Here you go. And I’m happy to hold your hand for as long as you need. Just breathe deeply, and remember that you’re safe. We’ll get through this together, one step at a time. It’s okay to be scared, and it’s okay to ask for help.
