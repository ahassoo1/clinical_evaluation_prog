DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and tired lately, and I’ve been very yellow – my skin, my eyes, everything. It started after I ate some fava beans. I know it sounds odd, but that’s when it really seemed to kick in.
DOCTOR: Weakness, tiredness, and yellowing of the skin and eyes… that is something we need to look into. And you mentioned it started after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I hadn’t eaten them in years, but I was at a friend’s barbecue last week and they had a big dish of them. Everything seemed fine at first, then a couple of days later I started feeling really run down. And then I noticed the yellowing. It's quite frightening, to be honest. I haven’t felt this unwell in years.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It is unsettling to experience sudden changes like that. The timing with the fava beans is interesting… it makes me think of a few possibilities. Before we go further, can you describe the weakness and tiredness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just feeling a bit sleepy, you know? It's like… everything takes so much effort. Even walking up the stairs leaves me breathless. And I have very little energy to do anything. I used to enjoy gardening, but even that feels impossible now. I just feel… drained. It’s a heavy feeling, all over. And I get dizzy sometimes, especially if I stand up quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so significant weakness, fatigue impacting daily activities, shortness of breath with exertion, and dizziness upon standing… that gives us a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Actually, yes. I haven't been very hungry at all. Food just doesn't seem appealing. And when I do eat, my stomach feels a bit upset afterwards. Not exactly pain, more like… uncomfortable and bloated. I've lost a little weight, I think, but I haven't weighed myself recently. It's just another thing adding to the feeling of being unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, loss of appetite, stomach discomfort, and weight loss. I see here you have private insurance, which is good. And the clinic is located in an urban area, so access to specialist care shouldn’t be an issue if we need it. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling a bit thirsty lately, more so than usual. And my urine seems darker than normal, almost… brownish sometimes. I also noticed my heart is beating a bit faster than it used to, even when I’m resting. It’s not a racing heart, just… noticeable. I haven’t had a fever, thankfully, and no nausea or vomiting. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Increased thirst, darker urine, and a faster heartbeat… these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Actually, my stools have been… paler than usual. Almost clay-colored. And they haven't been as solid as they normally are. I didn't think it was important enough to mention before, but now that you ask… it’s been going on for a few days. It's all feeling very strange and unsettling, Doctor. I hope you can figure out what's wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mande. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. It is important, and you’re right to be concerned. Based on what you’ve told me – the weakness, tiredness, yellowing, darker urine, paler stools, and the connection to the fava beans – I’m thinking we need to investigate a few possibilities. One of these is a condition that can affect the liver and red blood cells. It can be triggered by certain foods, including fava beans. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We’ll check your abdomen, listen to your heart and lungs, and check your skin for signs of jaundice. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Please, do whatever you think is necessary to figure out what’s going on. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. The physical exam sounds good. Where should I begin?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, please. We'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll palpate your abdomen. I'll also examine your skin and eyes more closely. Don't hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. "Your heart rate is a little elevated, as you mentioned, but the rhythm seems regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your abdomen." "A little tenderness here on the right side, but nothing too dramatic. Now, let's take a closer look at your skin and eyes..." "Your skin is definitely jaundiced, and your eyes are also quite yellow. This confirms what you've been describing."
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… concerning, but I appreciate you explaining it to me as you go. Is it something serious, Doctor? I’m a bit scared, to be honest. I’ve never felt this unwell before, and the jaundice is quite frightening. What do you think it could be? And what tests do you want to run?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Mande, and it's perfectly reasonable to be scared. The jaundice is a sign that something is going on, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s something catastrophic. Based on your symptoms, the timing with the fava beans, and what I’m seeing during the exam, I suspect we should investigate a condition called hemolytic anemia, potentially Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency. It’s a genetic condition where the body has trouble processing certain substances, and it can be triggered by foods like fava beans, certain medications, or even infections. To confirm this, I want to order a complete blood count to check your red blood cell levels, a liver function test to see how your liver is doing, and a G6PD enzyme assay to measure the level of the enzyme in your blood. I also want to check your bilirubin levels to see how much of the yellow pigment is in your blood. We’ll also do a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess overall organ function. Finally, I’d like to order a stool sample to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. These tests will help us determine the exact cause of your jaundice and guide our treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Hemolytic anemia… G6PD deficiency… it all sounds very complicated, but I appreciate you explaining it to me. And yes, the tests sound reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever is necessary to get a diagnosis. So, how do we go about getting these tests done? Will I need to come back another day? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m worried about feeling so unwell for a long period of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mande. It is unsettling to be unwell, and waiting for test results can be stressful. We can draw the blood samples right here in the clinic. It’s a standard procedure, and shouldn’t take too long. The stool sample can be collected at home – I’ll give you a kit and instructions on how to do that properly. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the results, so we should have them back within a couple of days. Once we have the results, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods that might trigger your symptoms. Also, stay well-hydrated and get plenty of rest. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, high fever, or shortness of breath – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and reassurance. Fava beans are definitely off the menu! And I’ll be sure to stay hydrated and rest. Okay, so let’s get the blood drawn then. And you'll give me the kit for the stool sample? I hope it's not too unpleasant. I really hope we can figure out what's going on soon. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s get the blood drawn first. Our nurse, Maria, will be right in to take care of that. She's very skilled and gentle. And yes, I’ll give you the stool sample kit before you leave. It’s not the most pleasant thing in the world, but it’s an important part of the investigation. I'm optimistic we'll get to the bottom of this, Mande. We have a good starting point, and with the test results, we'll have a clearer picture. Maria will be with you momentarily. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Just waiting for the nurse, then. Thank you again for everything. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I’ll just sit here quietly until Maria arrives.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Take your time and relax. I'll be right nearby if you need anything at all. Just let me or Maria know. .
