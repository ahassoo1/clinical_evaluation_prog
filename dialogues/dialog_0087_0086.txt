DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, you said? I really don't have a lot of time today, unfortunately. Just need to know what everything showed, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your time is valuable. We received the results of your bloodwork and urine analysis from last week. Before we discuss those specifically, could you briefly recap what led you to come in for testing?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, I was feeling… just really tired, constantly. Like, beyond normal tired. And a bit shaky, sometimes. Honestly, it's been going on for a while, but it was getting worse. My job's pretty stressful, moving things around, lots of deadlines...figured it was probably that, but my boss suggested I get checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Constant fatigue and shakiness...and this has been ongoing for some time, worsening recently. The stress at work is a factor, understandably. And to clarify, when you say 'shaky,' can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It's not like, full-body shaking, if that makes sense? More like...my hands tremble a little. Especially when I'm trying to do something precise, like filling out forms or...loading a shipment manifest. It's subtle, but it’s there. And it gets worse if I haven't eaten for a while.
DOCTOR: I see. Hand tremors, exacerbated by stress and fasting. Okay. And aside from the fatigue and tremors, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really, no. Maybe a little bit more thirsty than usual, but I drink a lot of water anyway, with the job, you know? Keeping hydrated is important. Nothing else that really stands out, honestly. I feel pretty normal, apart from those two things.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other noticeable symptoms. And you mentioned drinking a lot of water with your work – any changes in your urination frequency or amount?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah, now that you mention it… I have been going to the bathroom a lot more. Like, way more than usual. Several times during the shift. Thought it was just from the water, but… maybe not? Definitely more frequent. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Increased urination frequency is certainly something we need to consider, yes. Alright, Ms. Kovtun, I've reviewed your results. Your blood glucose levels are elevated, and your urine analysis indicates glucose present as well. This is consistent with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2 diabetes. Now, I want to explain what this means and what our next steps will be, but first, do you have any questions about what I’ve said so far?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Seriously? Wow. Okay. Um… what does that mean, exactly? I mean, I know it has something to do with sugar, but… what's happening in my body? And is it…serious? My grandma had that, but… she was really old. I'm only 29.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, and it's good you're asking questions. Essentially, diabetes means your body either doesn't make enough insulin, or can't effectively use the insulin it does make. Insulin is a hormone that allows glucose – which is sugar – from the food you eat to enter your cells to be used for energy. When glucose can’t get into your cells, it builds up in your bloodstream, which is what we’ve seen in your results. As for seriousness, it’s important to manage diabetes effectively. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to various complications over time, affecting your heart, kidneys, eyes, and nerves. However, with proper lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication, many people live long and healthy lives with diabetes. Your age is not necessarily a barrier to successful management. We’ll discuss those changes now. First, let’s talk about diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Diet. Right. Honestly? Not great. Lots of quick things, I don't have a lot of time. I usually grab breakfast on the way to work - a pastry or something. Lunch is usually a sandwich and chips from the convenience store, or fast food if I'm really busy. Dinner...sometimes I cook, sometimes it's takeout. I drink a lot of soda, honestly. I know, I know, it's bad. It's just… convenient, and gives me a boost when I'm tired. Does that help? I'm not a good cook.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture. It sounds like there's room for improvement. The high sugar intake from the pastries, soda, and fast food is certainly contributing. We need to significantly reduce those. For the next step, I want to perform a quick physical exam to assess your overall health. Specifically, I'd like to check your feet, your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just… quick, please? I really need to get back to work. My boss is already annoyed that I'm even here. Feet, blood pressure, heart and lungs… Got it. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could please sit here, we'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Pedal pulses are present bilaterally, though slightly diminished. Sensation appears intact, but we will need to monitor this closely. No visible sores or blisters at this time. Skin is dry. Alright, everything appears relatively stable at the moment, but these findings warrant ongoing attention. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. Never had one. But… you're talking about medication already? Is that… necessary? I was hoping it would just be diet, you know? Cutting out sugar and stuff. I really don't like taking pills. Is there any way to manage this without medication? I'm pretty disciplined, when I need to be. I just… don't want to be dependent on something.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication. It's a valid concern. We can certainly try to manage this with diet and exercise first, and that’s my initial recommendation. However, based on your blood glucose levels and family history, it’s likely you’ll eventually need medication to help control your blood sugar effectively and prevent complications. We'll start with a trial of lifestyle modifications for the next three months. I’ll refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you create a personalized meal plan. I also strongly recommend incorporating regular exercise into your routine – at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We’ll recheck your blood glucose levels in three months. If they are not adequately controlled with diet and exercise alone, we’ll discuss medication options at that time. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Ugh, three months. Okay. Fine. Dietitian, exercise...three months. But, what kind of exercise? I'm not a gym person, if that matters. And… what's considered 'moderate-intensity'? I really don't want to feel like I'm killing myself, if that makes sense? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Like, are there foods I definitely need to avoid, apart from sugar? I just… want to be prepared. And quick, please. I’m really running out of time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. For exercise, anything that gets your heart rate up is good. Brisk walking, cycling, swimming – even gardening can be beneficial. “Moderate-intensity” means you should be able to talk while exercising, but not sing. It’s a level of exertion where you’re breathing harder, but not completely out of breath. This handout details foods to avoid and foods to prioritize. Generally, focus on lean proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and refined carbohydrates. We'll also monitor your cholesterol levels, as diabetes can increase your risk of heart disease. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today. At that time, we’ll review your progress, check your blood glucose levels, and discuss any concerns you may have. Do you have any other questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Ugh, it's a lot. But...okay. Dietitian, exercise, three months, no sugar… Got it. Okay, thanks, Doctor. I really appreciate you being quick. I have to get back to work now. Hopefully, this works.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kovtun. I understand your time is valuable. Remember to follow up with the dietitian as soon as possible. And please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before your next appointment. Have a good day.
