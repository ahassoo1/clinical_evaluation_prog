DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, it's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. I don't need to explain it any further, do I? It's embarrassing, okay? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Ambris, and I apologize for any embarrassment this is causing you. Of course, we'll do our best to determine the cause and find a solution. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: What do you mean what do I mean? It smells. Like, constantly. It doesn't come and go. It's just... there. People avoid me, I can tell. Is that enough detail for you? Honestly, I'm not one for complaining about personal things. It's just... gross.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Ms. Ambris. It sounds very distressing. When did you first notice this persistent odor?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know. A while ago. Maybe… six months? It's not like I'm keeping a calendar of bad breath days. Look, I work on the highway. It’s not exactly a glamorous job. Maybe it's that? I don't know. Do you need me to list every single thing I eat? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Listing everything you eat isn’t necessary right now. It’s helpful to know you work on the highway, though, as that might give us some clues. Six months is a significant amount of time to experience this. Are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed alongside the odor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I haven't been sick sick. My gums bleed sometimes when I brush, but I always have. And my mouth feels kind of… dry. That’s it. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just want this fixed. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris. Bleeding gums and a dry mouth are important details. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your mouth, teeth, or gums?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Just… annoyed. And thirsty, sometimes. Look, is this going to take long? I've got things to do. I don’t have all day to sit here describing how my mouth feels. Honestly, I'm probably fine. It's probably just stress.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Ambris. While stress can sometimes contribute to oral health issues, it's important to rule out other potential causes. Would you mind if I quickly examine your mouth and gums?
PATIENT: Examine? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't poke around too much. I don’t like being touched. And if you try to sell me some fancy mouthwash, I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Ms. Ambris. I simply want to assess the situation. Please open your mouth for me. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay. I'm observing some redness and swelling of your gums, and your tongue appears slightly coated. Do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t smoke. Or vape. Or whatever the kids are doing these days. It's disgusting. Look, are you done yet? This is really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ambris, I am finished with the examination for now. You’re right to speak up if you’re uncomfortable. It does appear that there is some gingivitis, which is inflammation of the gums. The coated tongue could also contribute to bad breath. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about your oral hygiene routine. Could you describe how you brush and floss your teeth?
PATIENT: Look, I brush them. When I remember. And sometimes I floss. Okay? It's not like I have a fancy routine. I have a life, you know? I work long hours. I don't have time to spend ages in the bathroom. It's not like I'm eating garlic all day. Honestly, I don't understand what the big deal is. It's just breath.
DOCTOR: I understand you have a busy schedule, Ms. Ambris. However, consistent oral hygiene is very important for preventing gingivitis and maintaining fresh breath. It sounds like there may be room for improvement in your routine. Do you use mouthwash at all?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I don't do fancy routines. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I just want a solution, not a lecture on how to brush my teeth. Is there a pill I can take? Or something? I don't have time for this. I need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris. There isn’t a single pill to solve this. The most effective approach involves improving your oral hygiene routine, which includes brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and potentially using an antimicrobial mouthwash. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. Second, daily flossing. And third, a chlorhexidine mouthwash for two weeks to help reduce bacteria. I’ll write you a prescription for that. We also need to rule out other possible causes. I'd like to order some blood work to check for underlying conditions. And I would recommend a dental cleaning and examination with a dentist as soon as possible. Would you be open to that?
