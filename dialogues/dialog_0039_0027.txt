DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Altine. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It’s about time someone got around to seeing me. It’s my stomach, alright? Keeps…coming up on me. Food, you know? Not pleasant. Just want something done about it, quickly if you please. I have things to manage.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Coming up on you” – so you’ve been experiencing some vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? Is that what you call it these days? No, not exactly vomiting. It’s more of a…regurgitation. A forceful return, if you will. And it’s not like I’m throwing up constantly, it just happens. Especially after I eat. Look, do we need to get into the specifics of how my body works? It’s rather…undignified.
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all, Mr. Altine. I apologize if I used the wrong term. "Regurgitation" is perfectly fine. And you’re right, it doesn't sound pleasant at all. It’s good you're telling me about it. Let me just see… I see here you’re 67 years old. And your weight is listed as 51…is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. What of it? Are you questioning my health based on a number? I assure you, I’m quite fit for my age, despite…this little issue. I keep things managed. And frankly, I find it rather insulting you’re dwelling on such trivialities when I'm here for a problem. Let’s focus on fixing the regurgitation, shall we?
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all, Mr. Altine. I assure you, I wasn’t questioning anything. I just like to have a complete picture. Weight can sometimes be a factor in these sorts of things, that's all. Okay, so this regurgitation… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? A while. Months, I suppose. It comes and goes. It’s not like it happens every single day. But it’s enough to be…inconvenient. Especially when I’m trying to have a decent meal. Look, I eat properly, good food. It’s not like I’m indulging in…junk. It just…happens. It's frustrating, really. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Okay, months, coming and going… and it happens after meals. Do you notice anything specific triggering it?
PATIENT: Specific? No. Not really. I mean, sometimes if I eat too much, perhaps. But I don’t overeat! It's just… certain foods, maybe? Rich sauces, sometimes. But I like rich sauces! It's a matter of preference, you understand? Look, I’m not a scientist, I can’t pinpoint the exact cause. It just…feels random. And it's happening more lately. Is that helpful? Because I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more frequent lately, sometimes with richer foods, but not always predictable. Do you experience any other symptoms with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like…pain? No, not really. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, but I have antacids. I manage. It’s just the…returning of the food. That's the main problem. Honestly, it's rather unpleasant. And it interrupts my sleep occasionally. But I have things to do, you understand? I can’t be kept up all night by a little…regurgitation. It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn sometimes, managed with antacids, and occasionally disrupts sleep. Any nausea or vomiting before the regurgitation happens?
PATIENT: Vomiting? We've already established it's not vomiting! And nausea? No. It just…happens. It comes up. There’s no warning. No feeling sick beforehand. It's abrupt. Look, I'm a very practical man. I don’t have time for all these…nuances. Just tell me what you can do about it. Are you going to prescribe something, or am I wasting my time here?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like this is quite bothersome. I'm trying to gather all the information to get a better understanding. Given your history and what you're describing, it could be a few things. It's possible it's related to acid reflux, even if the antacids help sometimes. But given the abrupt nature and the frequency, we should rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to let me listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope?
PATIENT: Listen to my abdomen? Really? Is that necessary? Look, I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded. I'm a busy man. And frankly, I doubt listening to my stomach will reveal anything useful. It's regurgitation, not…some mysterious internal ailment. But…fine. If you insist. Just be quick about it. I have things to manage. Don't take all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick listen. I’ll need you to lie back for this. It’ll help me hear what's going on. It won't take long. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. No immediate signs of obstruction or anything concerning. I do notice some slight tenderness in your upper abdomen when I press here. Does that bother you?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It's…uncomfortable. Not agonizing, but certainly not pleasant. Look, is that significant? Is my stomach broken? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. All this poking and prodding for…a little regurgitation. I really don’t have time for this. Just tell me what you think is wrong and what you’re going to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. The tenderness could indicate some inflammation in your stomach or esophagus. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s worth investigating further. Given your symptoms and the tenderness, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A blood test to check for inflammation and a possible endoscopy to look directly at your esophagus and stomach. The endoscopy would involve a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end. It’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your regurgitation. It's usually very well-tolerated, but it does require some preparation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A tube down my throat? Are you serious? Absolutely not! I’m not having a camera shoved down my esophagus. That sounds…barbaric. I came here for a simple stomach issue, not an invasive procedure. Look, I’m a practical man. I don't believe in unnecessary medical interventions. I’ll just take some stronger antacids, thank you very much. Or perhaps I’ll get a second opinion. I really don't have time for this nonsense. Just…forget the tests. I’m wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Altine. I understand. While I strongly recommend investigating further to get an accurate diagnosis, I respect your decision to decline the tests. In that case, we can try a stronger medication for acid reflux. I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, which should help reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. However, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a couple of weeks, please come back and see me. It’s important to rule out any more serious causes. And if you experience any difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or weight loss, seek immediate medical attention. Here's the prescription. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
