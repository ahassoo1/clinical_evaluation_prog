DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t we start by you telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a reset, or a jumpstart, as I wrote down. I’m not really sick, not in the traditional sense, but I don’t feel…myself. I just want to feel better, more energetic, you know? Is that…reasonable?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Pitzel. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health, even if you don't have a specific illness. Feeling “stuck” or lacking energy is definitely something we can explore. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about what “not yourself” feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s difficult to explain. It's not one specific thing, Doctor. Just…a general lack of motivation. Everything feels harder than it used to. I used to enjoy my work, the shaping and casting, but lately…it’s a chore. I sleep alright, I think, and I'm eating…well, reasonably. I just don’t have the drive I used to. And honestly, I've been a bit forgetful lately, small things mostly, but it's concerning. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Pitzel. A decrease in motivation, feeling fatigued, and noticing some forgetfulness…those are all things we should investigate. To get a clearer picture, let's start with a bit more detail about this fatigue. When did you first start noticing this lack of energy?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It wasn't sudden, not like catching a cold. It’s been…gradual. I suppose it started maybe six months ago? Around the time my daughter had her first baby, actually. I was helping her a lot, which was wonderful, but…looking back, that's when I first started feeling so drained. It’s gotten progressively worse since then, I’d say. Is it normal to feel this way after becoming a grandmother? I mean, I love being a grandmother, but…it's a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s completely normal to experience changes in energy levels and feelings with significant life events, Ms. Pitzel, and becoming a grandmother is definitely one of those! Helping your daughter is wonderful, and it can be very taxing. Let’s try to pinpoint how this fatigue is affecting your daily life. Are you having trouble with specific tasks?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. My work, for one. I used to be able to work on a piece for hours, lost in it completely. Now, I find myself getting distracted easily, needing to take breaks much more often. Even simple things, like keeping the studio tidy…it feels overwhelming. And I’ve started saying “no” to commissions, which I never used to do. It’s impacting my livelihood, honestly. And, I hate to admit it, but sometimes I just feel…irritable. Not at anyone in particular, just…short-tempered, I suppose. Is that…concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to hear those specifics, Ms. Pitzel, and yes, those are things we need to explore further. Difficulty concentrating, feeling overwhelmed, irritability… these can all be indicators of several things. To get a broader picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that. And I had a rather difficult pregnancy with my daughter, but it resolved after her birth. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions. I see my general practitioner for yearly check-ups, and everything has always been…fine. Blood pressure a little high sometimes, but nothing they couldn't manage with diet and exercise. I have Medicare, so they usually catch anything serious, I assume. I haven’t been seriously ill in decades, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Pitzel. And you're right, regular check-ups are important. Having a history of slightly elevated blood pressure is helpful information, though. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure, Doctor. Ten milligrams, I believe. And occasionally, I take ibuprofen for a headache, but not regularly. I try to avoid medication when I can, truthfully. I also take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, as I don’t get much sun. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I don’t like to take things unless I absolutely have to. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Pitzel. It’s good you’re mindful of what you’re taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten everything, traveled everywhere, and never had a problem. My husband is allergic to cats, but I am not. That’s the only allergy in the family, really. Does that sound…strange? I feel like everyone has some kind of allergy these days. But I truly don’t have any, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: No, that's not strange at all, Ms. Pitzel. Not everyone has allergies, and it's perfectly fine if you don't. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. She developed it later in life, around her sixties. And my father…he had heart problems. He had a stroke, unfortunately. He was a smoker for most of his life, so that likely contributed. My sister is healthy, as far as I know, and my brother has high cholesterol. Nothing major, really. Just the usual things, I suppose. Is that helpful information, Doctor? I sometimes wonder if these things are inevitable, regardless of what we do.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Pitzel. A family history of diabetes and heart disease is important to know. It doesn’t mean you will necessarily develop those conditions, but it does mean we should be extra vigilant. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I've been married to my husband, Ricardo, for twenty-seven years. He's a retired engineer. We have one daughter, Isabella, who recently had a baby, as I mentioned. We live in a suburban area, a quiet neighborhood. I don't smoke, I drink very occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner maybe once a week. I enjoy spending time with my family, and I used to be quite active in the local arts community, but I haven’t been as involved lately. I enjoy reading and gardening when I have the energy. It’s a pretty quiet life, all things considered. Is there anything specific you’d like to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good overview, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then listen to your heart and lungs. It's just a routine check to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgment completely. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I'm hoping it’s nothing serious, but I appreciate you being thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. It’s consistent with your previous readings, from what you’ve told me. Your heart rate is 72 and regular. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling sounds. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly. I’d also like to check your reflexes and neurological function, just as a precaution. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally, which is normal. Your neurological function appears intact. Based on the physical exam, everything appears within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a little high, as we discussed. Now, I’d like to order some lab work to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue and lack of energy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible, Doctor. If it helps to get to the bottom of this, I’m happy to do it. A complete picture sounds good. I just want to feel like myself again. Will these tests take long? And will I need to fast beforehand? I have Isabella and the baby to help with, you know. I need to be able to schedule around things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pitzel. It’s important to be able to manage your responsibilities. The tests shouldn’t take long—a standard blood draw, about 10-15 minutes. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. We can schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning, which would make fasting easier. Would you prefer I have my nurse schedule that for you, or would you like to handle it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful if your nurse could schedule it for me, Doctor. That would save me a lot of trouble. First thing in the morning sounds perfect. Please, tell her I’m available any day next week. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure this out. I'm starting to feel a little hopeful, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my nurse, Maria, contact you shortly to schedule the appointment. She'll also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your healthy lifestyle habits—eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. If your fatigue worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan to help you feel better. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing there’s a plan in place. I’ll make sure to follow the instructions and contact you if anything changes. And I’ll look forward to hearing from Maria. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy time with your family.
