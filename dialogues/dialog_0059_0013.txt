DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's good to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see? Like it just… stays in there. It’s been happenin’ for a little while now, and it’s startin’ to bother me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying can certainly be bothersome. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not always, you see? Some days it’s fine. Other days… I have to… push, kinda. And even then, it doesn’t feel like everything comes out. It’s… uncomfortable, and I worry a little bit. I don’t want nothin’ bad to happen.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Hilber. It's good you're addressing this. When did you first start noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It started… maybe a couple months ago? It was slow at first, just a little bit harder to go. I thought it was just gettin’ older, to be honest. But it’s been gettin’ worse lately, that’s for sure. My wife… she passed last year… and things have been… different since then. Maybe it’s that too? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Hilber. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and it’s possible stress and emotional changes are contributing. Let's focus on the urinary symptoms for now, but please know I'm here to listen if you’d like to talk about anything else. Now, regarding the difficulty emptying – is it a slow stream, or does it start and stop?
PATIENT: It’s… kinda both, Doctor. It starts strong, usually. But then it gets… weaker. And it’ll stop, and I have to… wait a bit, then try again. Sometimes it just dribbles out at the end. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, but that’s what happens. It’s not like it used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: There's no need to be embarrassed, Mr. Hilber. These things are quite common, and we're here to help. You're doing the right thing by bringing this to our attention. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain or burnin’. Just… the feelin’ of not gettin’ it all out. And sometimes… a little bit of a weak feelin’ afterwards, like I still need to go. But no pain, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning, just incomplete emptying and a lingering sensation. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t really pay much attention to it, Doctor. I mean, it looks… normal, I guess? Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea. I’m not sure if that makes a difference. I haven’t noticed any bad smells, no.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Hilber. It's good to know you haven't noticed any significant changes in color or smell. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, prostate problems, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had a little bit of trouble with my blood sugar a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay after I changed my diet. Nothing else, really. My wife always handled the doctor stuff. I don't think I have any problems with… the prostate, is that what you said? I don't know much about that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. It's common for one partner to take the lead on medical matters. We’ll get through this together. Prostate problems are more common in men as they get older, and can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms. We may want to check that later, just to be sure. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was fishin’. They set it with a cast. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. My wife… she’ll know for sure, but… well, she’s gone.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. That’s quite alright. We can work with what you remember. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… tea, Doctor. Lots of tea. And sometimes I take a little bit of aspirin for my knees, when they bother me. That’s it, really. I don’t take nothin’ regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, tea and aspirin as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a reaction. My wife always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your abdomen, and possibly a brief neurological exam. We may also want to check a sample of your urine. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright, Doctor. I trust you. Checkin’ things sounds fine. A urine sample… yes, I can do that. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a sterile cup and instructions for collecting a clean urine sample. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream into the cup, and finish urinating. After you’ve collected the sample, I’ll have you lie down on the examination table and we’ll begin the abdominal exam. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds clear, Doctor. Mid-stream… I think I understand. Start and then… get some in the cup. I can do that. Where is the bathroom?
DOCTOR: Right through there, Mr. Hilber. Take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. The nurse, Sarah, is just outside if you need anything at all. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I’ll go do that now.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: I’m back, Doctor. I think I got it. Here’s the cup.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. Now, if you wouldn’t mind lying down on the examination table, we’ll begin the abdominal exam. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Just tell me what you’re doin’ as you go, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. This helps us assess your bowel function and identify any potential blockages or abnormalities. I’m listening now... sounds are present in all four quadrants, which is good. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll start here, on your lower abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… alright. A little bit of pressure, but no real pain. It feels… normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good. No tenderness noted in this area. Now, I’m going to check a bit higher up, on your upper abdomen. Still no significant tenderness here. How about on your sides?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ there either. Just… pressure. It doesn’t hurt, really. It’s just… you’re touchin’ me, you know? It’s been a long time since someone touched me like this. Not in a bad way, mind you. It’s just… strange.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Hilber. It's perfectly natural to feel a little strange or uncomfortable with a physical exam, especially given your circumstances. I apologize if I'm making you feel uneasy. I'll be as gentle and thorough as possible. Now, I’m just going to check for any enlarged lymph nodes in your groin area. This is just a routine part of the exam. I’m not feeling any enlarged lymph nodes. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’m going to need to listen to your back with my stethoscope to rule out any neurological issues. Would you mind turning over onto your stomach?
PATIENT: No, it’s alright, Doctor. You’re doin’ fine. Just… bein’ careful. My back’s a little stiff, you know? Old age.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Hilber. Many people experience stiffness with age. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, I’m going to listen to your back with my stethoscope, listening for any unusual sounds or abnormalities. Sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to gently tap on your back to check for any tenderness. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… tappin’. Feels like… like when they checked my reflexes when I was a kid. It’s alright, Doctor. You’re doin’ a good job.
DOCTOR: Good. Everything sounds clear. Okay, Mr. Hilber, that completes the physical exam. Now, we have a urine sample that we’ll send to the lab for analysis. This will help us check for any infection or other abnormalities. Based on the physical exam and your symptoms, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing your urinary difficulties, but it could be related to several things, including an enlarged prostate, a urinary tract infection, or a problem with your bladder muscles. It could also be something as simple as dehydration. We need to wait for the urine sample results to get a clearer picture. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a lot to take in. Enlarged… prostate? Is that bad? And what about the dehydration? I do drink a lot of tea, but not much water, I guess. It's just… hard to remember sometimes. What happens next? Do I need… tests? Or medicine?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Hilber. An enlarged prostate is common as men get older, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like difficulty emptying your bladder. We'll need to check your prostate with a simple blood test called a PSA. Dehydration can definitely contribute to urinary problems, so increasing your water intake is a good first step. As for what happens next, we will start with the PSA blood test and the urine analysis. Depending on the results of those tests, we may need to do some further investigation, such as an ultrasound of your bladder. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood and collect a sample for the urine analysis. Would you like me to explain the PSA test in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Tell me about the PSA test. What does it do? And will it hurt? I don't like needles much, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about needles. The PSA test, or Prostate-Specific Antigen test, is a simple blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. The protein level can sometimes be elevated in men with an enlarged prostate, prostate cancer, or other prostate conditions. The test itself is very quick and relatively painless. The nurse will simply draw a small amount of blood from your arm, just like any other blood test. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in, but it’s usually over very quickly. The results will be available in a few days, and we'll discuss them together. If the results are normal, it’s likely that your symptoms are due to something less serious. If the results are elevated, we may need to do some further investigation, such as an ultrasound or a biopsy, but we won't jump to any conclusions until we have all the information. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. So it’s just a blood test to see if my… prostate is okay? And it might not be anything serious? That’s… good. Okay. Let’s get the blood test done, then. What do I need to do? Do I need to fast? Or drink anything special?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. It's just a blood test to check your prostate. And you’re right to be optimistic – it very well might not be anything serious. For the PSA test, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks other than water. It’s important because food can affect the results. So, if you’ve had anything to eat or drink, we'll need to reschedule the test. I’ll have the nurse explain the fasting instructions to you in more detail, just to be sure. She’ll also let you know where to go for the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Just… thank you. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a lot better now. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. I guess I’ll go wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. That’s what I’m here for. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if any other questions come to mind. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll check in with you after the nurse has taken your blood. Sarah will be right with you. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: .
