DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need some forms notarized, actually. Health forms. I’ve got a stack here, and I just… need them signed and everything official, if you can help me with that. I'm Melvenia Tippens, by the way.
DOCTOR: Notarized… right. Hmm. You’ve come to the right place for medical concerns, Melvenia. I’m a doctor, so I can certainly review health forms, offer medical advice if needed, but I'm not a notary public. I’m afraid I can’t legally notarize documents. Perhaps the front desk staff can point you to a local notary?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. I… I thought all doctors could do that. You know, sign things official. This place was recommended to me, and nobody said anything about not being a notary. I just need them verified, really. Are you sure you can't even glance at them and say they look alright? It's just a lot of paperwork, and I’d really like to get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Melvenia. It's easy to get things mixed up. And I can certainly review the forms with you from a medical standpoint – make sure everything seems accurate and appropriate. But signing them officially as a notary is beyond my scope of practice. It carries legal weight, and I'm not authorized to do that. Let's take a look at what you have, and I can see if there's anything I can help you understand or clarify. We can also double-check that the information is consistent with your medical history, if you'd like. But again, I can't officially “verify” them in the way you need. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… a little more sense. I guess I was just hoping for everything to be done in one go. Okay, well, if you could just look over them and make sure nothing jumps out as wrong, that would be helpful. I don't really understand all the medical terms anyway. I just want to be sure they're filled out right so I can get this insurance sorted. It’s a mess, this whole thing. Do you need me to tell you what these are for or anything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. Let’s take a look. Knowing what these are for would be helpful, yes. That way I can focus on the important parts. And don’t worry about the medical terms – I’ll explain anything that’s unclear. What insurance are you applying for, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: It’s… complicated. It’s a new plan. A senior plan. My old insurance dropped me, and this one seemed… alright. I haven’t actually gotten the insurance yet, that’s why I need these forms filled out. They said they needed a doctor to verify my health information. It's supposed to help with the premiums, if I qualify. And… well, honestly, I just want to be covered in case something happens. I'm not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. Navigating insurance can be incredibly frustrating, and it’s good you’re getting everything sorted. A senior plan… okay. Alright, it looks like they want information about your past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies… standard stuff. Do you mind if I start by asking about any major health problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Let’s see… Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. That was… oh, goodness, must be thirty years now. And I used to have terrible migraines, but those haven’t bothered me in years. I broke my wrist a few years back, falling in the garden. Nothing too serious, just a cast and a lot of pain. And… oh, I had pneumonia once, a bad case of it. That was scary. Is that all you need to know for now?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, migraines in the past, broken wrist a few years ago, and pneumonia. Good, that’s helpful. Did you have any complications with any of those – the gallbladder surgery, the pneumonia, or the broken wrist?
PATIENT: Hmm… the gallbladder surgery went fine, as far as I know. They just took it out, and I went home a few days later. The pneumonia was pretty bad, I was in the hospital for a week, but I recovered. I remember being very tired for a long time afterwards. And the wrist… it healed okay, but it still aches sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Mostly it's just an annoyance, really. I don't think it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major complications from any of those. Fatigue after the pneumonia… that’s understandable. And some residual aches with the wrist, especially in cold weather. Do you currently take any medications, Melvenia?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was low on it. That’s it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to stay away from too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, Melvenia?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. I used to be a pretty good cook, you know. But it's hard to cook for one person these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know you don’t have any allergies. That’s helpful. Just to be thorough, have you had any major surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, before I got married. But that was… goodness, over fifty years ago. Does that matter? It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hysterectomy over fifty years ago. Yes, it's good to have a complete picture. Now, these forms ask about your family history. Do you know if any close relatives – parents, siblings – had any major medical conditions like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, just like me, I think. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my brother was healthy as a horse, never a sick day in his life. It's hard to remember all the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn't really talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, some kind of heart trouble in your father, and your brother was healthy. You mentioned your father had "some kind of heart trouble"... Do you remember anything more specific about that?
PATIENT: No, I'm sorry. That's the most I know. He just... wasn’t well when I was a child. He had chest pains sometimes, and he was very tired. He passed away when I was still in school. We didn’t talk about it much. It was a sad time. I really wish I knew more. But it’s been so long, and I was just a child.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details. Now, just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I never liked the smell of it. My mother smoked, but I always hated it. It always made me cough. I always thought it was a terrible habit. No, I've never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. A small glass. It helps me relax. But I don't drink every day. Maybe once or twice a week. Nothing heavy, Doctor. I’m not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. Alright, Melvenia, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your medical history now. Let’s take a quick look at your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get these forms taken care of. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m just going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Take a deep breath for me, Melvenia… and another one… Okay, lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. It's a soft murmur, nothing that seems overly concerning at the moment. Do you know if you’ve ever been told about a heart murmur before?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but nobody ever said anything about a murmur. Is it bad? What does it mean? I don’t like the sound of that. Is it serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Melvenia. It's not necessarily serious. A lot of people have innocent heart murmurs – they’re very common and often don’t cause any problems. It just means there’s a slightly different sound when your heart beats. However, because it's new information, I think it’s prudent to do an EKG – an electrocardiogram – just to get a better picture of your heart rhythm and rule out anything concerning. It's a quick, painless test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… oh dear. Is that one of those where they stick things on me? I don’t like things stuck on me. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I just need these forms signed. I don’t want to cause a fuss, or get a lot of tests done. I’m just an old woman.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Melvenia. It is just a few stickers, really – small electrodes that attach to your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. And it’s not about causing a fuss, it's about being thorough and making sure everything is alright. Because the murmur is new, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated, an EKG will give us a clearer picture and help me determine if any further investigation is needed. It’s a precaution, really. It takes just a few minutes. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's best… But please, make it quick. And don’t stick too many on me. I really don’t like things stuck on me. Is it going to take long? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. It will be quick, and I’ll use as few stickers as possible. It shouldn’t hurt at all – they’re just gentle adhesives. And it will only take a few minutes. Okay, if you could just lie back for me, I'll get you hooked up. It will be just a few moments. Just relax, and try to breathe normally. Okay, it's running now. We’ll just wait a few seconds.
PATIENT: This is uncomfortable. And cold. Please hurry. I really don't like this. Is it done yet? It feels strange having all those things stuck on me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia, all done. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: It was awful. Never again. Now what? Is something wrong? What did it show? Please just tell me. I don't want to wait.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks generally okay. There's a slight thickening of the heart muscle, which is common with age, and some minor irregularity in the rhythm, but nothing alarming. It doesn't explain the murmur completely, but it's not anything that needs immediate treatment. Given the murmur, I think it would be prudent to get an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart. It's non-invasive, painless, and will give us a much clearer picture of your heart structure and function. Do you think you’d be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: Another test? Honestly, Doctor, I just wanted these forms signed. This is getting ridiculous. I don't understand why I need all this done. Is there anything else? Can we just… look at the forms and see if they’re filled out right? Please? I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Melvenia. And you’re right, this is getting a bit more involved than just signing forms. But I feel it’s important to rule out anything serious before I can confidently say everything is alright. Let’s do this: I’ll review the forms with you carefully, make sure all the information is accurate based on what we've discussed, and then we can talk about scheduling the echocardiogram. If everything looks good on the forms, you can take them and hopefully get your insurance sorted. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better. Yes. Just look at the forms. Please. Just tell me what I need to initial or sign. I just want to be done with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start here. You mentioned gallbladder removal thirty years ago, migraines in the past, a broken wrist a few years back, and pneumonia. It says here you had migraines until five years ago. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. About five years ago. They just stopped bothering me, thankfully. I used to get terrible headaches. But they’re gone now, so that's good. Do I need to initial something? Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Just initial here to confirm that information is accurate. And it looks like you checked “No allergies.” Is that still correct?
PATIENT: Yes. No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I take Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Vitamin D. Is that all you need? It’s getting quite warm in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril and Vitamin D. Dosage is listed correctly as 20mg of Lisinopril and 2000 IU of Vitamin D daily?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t know. I just take the pills every day. I never pay attention to the numbers. Just whatever the doctor tells me. Is that a problem? Do I need to call my doctor? I really don’t want to deal with that right now.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. We can leave that for now. It's just good to check. It says here your mother had high blood pressure and your father had “heart trouble.” Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. High blood pressure for my mother, and my father just… wasn't well. I wish I knew more details, but I was just a child when he passed away. It's been so long. Is that enough? Do I need to write something specific? I really don't remember what kind of heart trouble he had. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Melvenia. You don’t need to remember specifics. “Heart trouble” is fine for now. Okay, last page. It asks about your current health complaints. It says here you haven’t experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yes. I haven’t had any of those things. Just… tired sometimes. But that’s just from getting old, I think. Is that it? Are we done? Can I take these forms now? Please? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. Everything looks accurate based on what we’ve discussed. You’ve completed the form correctly. Here you go. I still recommend getting an echocardiogram to evaluate the heart murmur, but you’re certainly not obligated. You can take these forms as they are and hopefully get your insurance sorted. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Finally. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. Even though it was a lot… I appreciate your patience. I think I’ll just go home and rest now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a good day.
