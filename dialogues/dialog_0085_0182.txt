DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let’s get this over with. I need a clearance for… a little touch-up. The surgeon wants me to be checked out first, all this paperwork these days. Honestly, a waste of time, but there you have it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. A pre-operative clearance, alright. We want to make sure you're in the best possible shape for your surgery. And you're right, paperwork is a part of it these days, but it helps us ensure everything goes smoothly. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this “touch-up” – what kind of surgery are you having, if you don't mind sharing?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather personal. But fine, since you insist. It's… a face lift. A small one. I’m not looking to look like one of those plastic dolls, just… tidied up a bit. My wife… well, she always said I had a strong face. But she’s gone now. And things… droop, you know? It’s just getting… embarrassing. But I don’t see what that has to do with you. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Orwin. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel your best, and there's absolutely no shame in that. And I apologize if my questions felt intrusive; I simply need to gather information to ensure your safety during and after the procedure. So, a face lift. And you're saying it's primarily for cosmetic reasons, to address some sagging?
PATIENT: Yes, sagging! Are you writing all this down? Honestly. It’s obvious. And yes, cosmetic. I’m eighty-one years old, not falling apart physically, just… gravity, you know? I’ve always been healthy. Good stock, Norwegian, we don't tend to… fail. So can we skip the twenty questions and get this over with? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Mr. Orwin. It’s important for a complete medical record. And you’re right to point out your good health; that's excellent. Norwegian stock is known for its longevity! Let's try to be efficient then. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – anything like heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure, or problems with your lungs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, good stock. I used to work with terrazzo, you know. Physical work. You don't do that with a bad heart. Bit of arthritis in the hands now, but who doesn't? And I’ve always been careful with my diet, none of that fast food nonsense. Honestly, I think doctors these days just look for things to find. What's next? Blood pressure? I bet it's perfect.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. And you're right, a history of physical work is a good sign. We'll check your blood pressure, of course, as a standard part of the clearance. And it sounds like you've taken very good care of yourself. Let’s start with that then. And while I’m listening to your heart and lungs, could you tell me if you’ve ever had any problems with shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No. Never. Shortness of breath? I used to hike mountains! Chest pain? Only when my son did something foolish. And dizziness… well, sometimes when I stand up too quickly, but who doesn't get a little lightheaded? Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole visit is unnecessary. Are you sure the surgeon sent you? Perhaps he’s just trying to drum up business for you. I've never had so many questions in my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Orwin, and I apologize if this feels excessive. The surgeon likely has a standard protocol for pre-operative clearances, and we want to ensure we haven’t missed anything. It’s better to be thorough, even if it seems like a waste of time. Alright, let’s try a different approach. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never. Terrazzo work isn’t exactly surgery-prone, you know. I’ve broken a few bones over the years, a hand here, a foot there… mostly healed. But no proper surgeries. I’ve always been lucky, or strong, or… both. Just get this over with, please. I'm losing my patience. And I really do have that luncheon. I’m meeting Reginald. He’s very punctual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. No surgeries, a few broken bones that have healed well. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more quick questions, then we can move on to the physical exam, and hopefully get you to your luncheon with Reginald on time. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Absolutely not. I ate everything put in front of me as a child. Builds character, you know. And I've never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a slight sniffle from dust sometimes, but that’s hardly an allergy. Honestly, I think this is ridiculous. What surgeon sends an eighty-one-year-old terrazzo worker for this sort of… interrogation? Is Reginald waiting? I should really be going. .
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. We're almost finished with the preliminary questions. Just a couple more to cover. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
