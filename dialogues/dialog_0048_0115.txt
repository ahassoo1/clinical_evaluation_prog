DOCTOR: Right. Annelle Durig, 77. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Sink. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s gotten terribly yellow. Not a nice color at all. And my… my doctor, the one before, he mentioned something about my liver, a long time ago. It’s all rather fuzzy, you understand. I just want to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, “yellow skin.” Jaundice, likely. And a prior mention of liver issues. Vague history, unfortunately. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific… Oh dear. I truly wish I could be. It was… many years ago, perhaps ten? Or more? He said something about hepatitis, I believe. I wasn’t feeling well, naturally, but I don’t recall much beyond that. I haven’t really seen a doctor regularly since. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Ten years ago… that's not particularly useful without records. Hepatitis… there are several types. And without knowing which type, or if it was even fully resolved, it complicates things. Do you recall how you contracted it, if that was even determined?
PATIENT: Contracted…? Oh, goodness. No, I don’t believe so. It was… a general illness. I just felt unwell, tired, and then my skin started to change color. He gave me some pills, I think. And told me to rest. It wasn’t a pleasant time, but I don’t recall the specifics of how I got sick. I was younger then, and… well, things fade, don't they? Is this… important?
DOCTOR: Important?
PATIENT: Well, of course it’s important, Doctor. But I simply don't know. I wasn't told. It was a long time ago, and I haven't been feeling well lately, and that's why I'm here, isn't it? This yellowing… it's worrying me. Perhaps we could just focus on that, on getting it sorted, if you don't mind?
DOCTOR: Right. Jaundice. We’ll need to run some tests to determine the cause. Liver function panel, complete blood count… and I’d like to check your bilirubin levels, naturally. Let's get started. Please follow me to the examination room. I’ll need to take your vitals and then we'll proceed with a physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh. Tests. Very well. I suppose that’s… sensible. Lead the way, Doctor. I’m not fond of hospitals, you see, but I understand it’s necessary. I hope it won’t take too long. I have a… a luncheon appointment. It’s not terribly important, but… well.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be efficient. Blood work first, then a brief examination. It shouldn’t be lengthy. Please sit on the examination table. And try not to move your arms unnecessarily.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Efficient is good. This is… a bit high, isn't it? I haven’t been on a table like this in years. Try not to move my arms, you say? Very well. I'll just sit here quietly then. Are you drawing blood now?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll start with the blood draw. I need to locate a vein. Please extend your arm. And try to relax. You have surprisingly… difficult veins.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Difficult veins? That’s… not a good sign, is it? I've never been very good with needles, you see. Perhaps… perhaps we could try the other arm? This one’s always been a bit… stubborn. It’s alright, really. I can manage, it’s just… I do get a little faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: Fine. Other arm. Try to remain still. This is becoming needlessly complicated. There. Got it. And… there we go. That's done. Don't move your arm. A bandage will be applied momentarily. Now, let's proceed with the physical exam. I need to palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Finished with the needle. Thank you, Doctor. Palpate my abdomen… Is that going to be… uncomfortable? I do have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. And I ate a biscuit earlier, a shortbread biscuit. Will that matter? Please be gentle, Doctor, if you don’t mind. It’s… just a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: A biscuit shouldn’t be a significant issue. I'm simply checking for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver. Hmm. There’s some tenderness in the right upper quadrant. And your liver does feel slightly enlarged. This is… concerning. We'll need to review the lab results. But it appears we’re dealing with more than just a simple case of jaundice.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Concerning? More than just jaundice? I knew it was something serious. What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? I'm not a medical person, you see, and I don't understand these terms. Is it something I should be very worried about? My luncheon… is it going to have to be cancelled?
DOCTOR: “Worried” is not particularly helpful at this stage. It could be a number of things. Hepatitis, as we discussed, though chronic. Cirrhosis is a possibility. Less likely, but we need to rule it out. Let’s not jump to conclusions. I will order an ultrasound to visualize the liver. And a more comprehensive blood panel. Do you have any family history of liver disease?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Chronic… cirrhosis… Those sound… dreadful. Family history… let me see… My mother, she… she wasn’t well when she was older. She had a lot of stomach troubles, I remember. But she never went to the doctor much. And my father… he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life. But he… he drank a little, sometimes. A little too much, perhaps. Would that matter? The drinking, I mean? Is this my fault?
DOCTOR: It's rarely "fault," Mrs. Durig. But alcohol consumption can contribute to liver disease. As can other factors. We'll have a clearer picture once the ultrasound and bloodwork results are in. I’m ordering those tests now. You’ll receive a call from the lab to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to abstain from alcohol completely. And avoid any over-the-counter medications without consulting a pharmacist. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. No alcohol. Of course. No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I know the results? And what happens then? Will I need… will I need to be admitted to the hospital? I truly hope not. I… I have a luncheon to attend. It’s a very important luncheon. And I promised to bring the biscuits.
DOCTOR: The results will take approximately 24 to 48 hours. The lab will contact you directly. As for admission… it’s too early to say. It depends entirely on the severity of the findings. I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help with some of the symptoms while we wait for the results. It’s a mild diuretic to reduce fluid retention. Take this to your pharmacist. And I strongly suggest you reschedule your luncheon. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. A diuretic… and reschedule the luncheon. I… I suppose not. Though I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I really must be going now. Thank you, Doctor. I shall… I shall leave you to your patients. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Good day.
