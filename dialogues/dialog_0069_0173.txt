DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Andraca, nice to meet you too! Well, I've just been getting these chills lately. It's kind of weird, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just…cold. It started a few days ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills without a fever are definitely something we should look into. A few days ago… can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was probably Tuesday? I was at work, and I just felt a sudden shiver. I thought maybe the AC was too high, but then it kept happening throughout the day, even when I was busy and warm. It's not constant, just comes and goes. It’s just… annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a good way to put it, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. And it happens throughout the day, even when you’re active?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. Like, I was unloading groceries yesterday, and I still got a shiver then. It’s not like a trembling, more like…a wave of cold washes over me. It doesn’t last long, maybe a minute or two, then it’s gone. But it’s happened several times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And has anything else been going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Not really… I mean, work’s been stressful, as usual. And I’ve been a bit tired, but who isn’t these days, right? I haven't been sick or anything, no cough, no sore throat, nothing like that. Just…the chills and a little bit of exhaustion. Oh, and maybe a little bit of a headache on and off, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stress and fatigue can definitely contribute to feeling unwell. Let’s talk a little bit more about the headache – where exactly do you feel it, and what does it feel like?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my temples, kind of a dull ache. Not like a pounding migraine, just…pressure, I guess? It comes and goes with the chills sometimes, but not always. It’s hard to explain, it’s not a bad headache, just noticeable. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, dull pressure in your temples, sometimes coinciding with the chills, but not always. And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms like muscle aches, night sweats, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No muscle aches, definitely not night sweats, and my appetite’s been normal. I’ve actually been eating pretty well, trying to keep my energy up. I'm just…confused, honestly. It's just these random chills and this little headache. It feels a bit silly coming to the doctor for this.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Jailenne. It’s always good to get things checked out, and it's important to rule out any underlying causes. Let’s go over your medical history a little bit. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing major, really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. No serious illnesses. I broke my arm once, but that was ages ago. I’m generally pretty healthy, to be honest. I do have some mild asthma, but it’s well-controlled with an inhaler. I only use it when I have a bad cold or something. Other than that, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Mild asthma, well-controlled with an inhaler. And are you currently taking any medications, other than the inhaler?
PATIENT: No, just the inhaler. I don't take any daily medications or anything like that. I try to stay away from pills if I can, you know? I prefer to just deal with things naturally if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no daily medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, thankfully! No reactions to any medications either, as far as I remember. My mom always said I was a pretty easy baby, haha. I haven't had any hives or trouble breathing or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandma had diabetes, on my mom’s side. And my dad had high blood pressure. Nothing too serious that I can think of, honestly. No heart disease or cancer that I know of. It's not a super healthy family, but nothing major runs in the blood, if that makes sense. We just... tend to be a bit stubborn about taking care of ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Diabetes in your grandmother, high blood pressure in your father. And finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it. Definitely no recreational drugs. I try to keep things pretty clean, you know? I work with people, it’s important to set a good example.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Jailenne, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Definitely. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s causing these chills!
DOCTOR: Great. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, pulse is 72 and regular, blood pressure is 120/80, and respiration is 16 and unlabored. Your heart sounds are normal – regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezing or crackles. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Your throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears appear normal as well. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Everything seems normal so far, which is good. However, given your symptoms, I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying infection or other potential causes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good, even if everything seems normal. Yes, blood work sounds like a good idea. It’s good to be thorough, you know? Better safe than sorry. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's always best to be thorough. We’ll do a complete blood count – that will check for any signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause chills and fatigue. And we'll do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes. Finally, we'll check your Vitamin D levels, as a deficiency can sometimes cause similar symptoms. It’s a fairly standard set of tests, and should give us a good overview of what’s going on. It shouldn't take too long, and the lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Those all sound like reasonable things to check. Vitamin D, that’s interesting, I haven't thought of that. No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just down the hall, you said? Great. Should I just go now and they’ll know I’m coming from your office?
DOCTOR: Yes, just head down the hall. They are expecting you, and the lab technician will know you’re coming from my office. They will just need your insurance information and a photo ID. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Typically it takes a few days, but I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else before you go?
PATIENT: No, that sounds perfect. I think I'm good to go. Thank you so much, Dr. Andraca, for taking the time to listen and run these tests. I feel much better knowing we're looking into it. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I hope you have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
