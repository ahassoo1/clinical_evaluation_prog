DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time now, I think. Honestly, the days kinda blend together. I just feel worn out, all the time. Is that… is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a very good place to start, Ms. Licano. "Always tired" is certainly something we need to explore. When you say "a long time," could you give me a sense of how many months, or perhaps even years, this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, I think. Maybe… three? Four? It's hard to say exactly. My husband… he passed a few years back, and things got… fuzzy after that. It was probably around then it started getting worse, but honestly, I can’t pinpoint it. I just… stopped having the energy to keep track, I guess. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. Losing your husband is a tremendous loss, and it's completely understandable that other things might have felt less clear during that time. We'll take it slow, don’t worry about dates at all. So, this tiredness… is it constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's... mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, definitely. But even on a “good” day, I still feel… drained. Like I’ve run a marathon just getting out of bed. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I do. Rest doesn’t really help, and neither does… well, anything, really. It’s just… there. All the time. I work at the pharmacy, you know, and even that feels exhausting now. I used to love my job.
DOCTOR: I see. Working at a pharmacy requires a lot of energy and focus, so it's concerning to hear that it's become so difficult. And it's good you've noticed it's impacting things you used to enjoy. To help me understand a little better, can you describe what kind of tiredness it is?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a hard question. It’s not like I’m sleepy, exactly. I can sleep, but it doesn’t refresh me. It’s more… a weight, I guess. Like my body is full of lead. And… I don’t have the… the drive to do things. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels like a huge effort. Even just… thinking sometimes. I don't know if that makes any sense at all. Is that what you mean? I'm not good at this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. You’re describing it very well. It sounds like it’s more than just physical fatigue; there’s a mental component as well. We call that feeling of being weighed down and lacking motivation sometimes “asthenia.” Now, aside from the tiredness and the feeling of being weighed down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Oh dear. Let me think… Well, I’ve been… a little more forgetful lately, I suppose. Even worse than usual. And my muscles ache sometimes, but I thought that was just… getting old. I don't know. Everything feels disconnected, like I'm watching my life happen instead of… living it. Does any of that sound important? I really just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: It all sounds very important, Ms. Licano. Don't minimize anything. The forgetfulness, the muscle aches, and that feeling of disconnection are all things we need to explore. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like thyroid problems, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was ages ago. And… I had a bit of high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some pills and it went down. I stopped taking them a while back, though. I thought I was okay. Honestly, I don’t really go to the doctor much. I just… put up with things. Is that bad? I take Medicare, of course. Does that help? I don't know what else I've had. My memory is just… awful.
DOCTOR: It's good to know about the gallbladder removal and the previous high blood pressure, even though it resolved. It's also helpful to know you're covered by Medicare. And it's perfectly alright that you don't go to the doctor often; many people feel that way. We'll work together to figure things out. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… Just this. I take a multi-vitamin sometimes. And… oh! I think I have some ibuprofen for when my muscles really ache. But that's it, really. I try not to take too many pills. My husband always said… never trust doctors. It’s silly, I know. He just… had a bad experience once. I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Ms. Licano. It's good to know about the multi-vitamin and the ibuprofen. And it’s perfectly understandable to have those feelings about doctors based on your husband’s experience. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's just seasonal. Nothing serious. I just… don’t really have a lot of problems, usually. I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is so… draining. Is there anything we can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want this to be over with, honestly. I have some errands to run, and I’m already feeling… more tired just talking. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your thyroid feels normal. Your abdomen is also normal to the touch. Now, let’s just quickly check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Everything seems normal neurologically as well. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. It’ll help us check for things like anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. It's a pretty standard panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds good. Anything to help figure this out. Blood work is fine. Just… please don’t make me come back too many times. I really don’t have the energy for a lot of appointments. And… could you tell me what you’re looking for, exactly? I’m not a doctor, so I don't understand all the… medical words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. I completely understand your concern about multiple appointments, and I’ll do my best to keep things efficient. The blood work will help us look for a few key things. First, we’ll check a complete blood count, or CBC, which tells us if you have enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Low red blood cells can cause anemia, which makes you feel tired and weak. We’ll also check your thyroid function, as an underactive thyroid can also cause fatigue. We'll also look at your vitamin levels, particularly vitamin D and B12, as deficiencies in those can also contribute to tiredness. Finally, we’ll check for inflammation, as that can be a sign of other underlying conditions. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you for explaining it. So, if something is low, or high, then you’ll know what’s wrong? I just… I want to feel normal again. Is there anything I can do now to help, while we wait for the results? Anything at all? I’m starting to feel… really worn out just sitting here.
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Ms. Licano. If something is low or high, it will give us a clue as to what might be causing your tiredness, and we can investigate further. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, there are a few things you can try. First, make sure you’re getting enough sleep—aim for 7-8 hours per night. Try to establish a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. Second, stay hydrated—drink plenty of water throughout the day. Third, eat a healthy, balanced diet—focus on whole foods, like fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And finally, try to manage your stress—practice relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation. I also recommend gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able. But don’t overdo it—listen to your body and rest when you need to. I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood work. You can get it done at the lab just down the street. The results usually take a few days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds manageable. Seven to eight hours of sleep. I can try. I used to love walking, but… I haven’t had the energy lately. I’ll try to do a little bit. Okay. Down the street, you said? That's good. Closer is better. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, and… for not making me feel like I'm crazy. This tiredness is so… debilitating. I just want to feel like myself again. Let me know when I can come back. And… thank you again. I think I just need to go home and rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. And you are absolutely not crazy—fatigue can be a very real and debilitating symptom. We'll figure this out together. The lab is right down the street, as you said—just a few minutes walk. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have the receptionist contact you when your results are available. Get some rest, Ms. Licano. And I look forward to seeing you again soon.
