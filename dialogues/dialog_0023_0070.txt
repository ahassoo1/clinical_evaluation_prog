DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too. Versace, you say? Yes... I just moved here. New area, you know? Need to... find a doctor. Social thing, really. Medicare sent me. Something about a check-up? I forget what they said, honestly. It was a lot of papers.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient visit, initiated by Medicare. That explains the paperwork. Well, a "check-up" can mean a lot of things. To get started, let's try to narrow it down. You said you just moved here. Has it been long?
PATIENT: Not long, no. Maybe... three months? Something like that. From… a bigger place. Lots of noise. I needed quiet. This town seems… quiet. Very quiet. I do makeup, you know? For the… the stage. It's hard to concentrate with all the banging and shouting. People.
DOCTOR: Stage makeup, interesting. And the move was primarily for a quieter environment to facilitate your work?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Though, it’s…difficult finding work here. Not many…productions. Mostly just…people going to the grocery store. It’s a change. A big change. I used to work with…famous people. Very famous. Now… well, now I mostly miss the bright lights. It’s good to meet you, though. You seem…serious.
DOCTOR: Serious is…thorough, Mr. Szmyd. We'll get to the reason for your visit. While your career is…fascinating, it doesn’t directly inform your medical needs. Are you experiencing any current health concerns?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Hmm… let me think. My back… sometimes it aches. Old age, probably. And… I get tired. Very tired. But everyone gets tired, right? I don't know if that's a concern. I sleep enough, I think. Seven, maybe eight hours. Sometimes I dream about… the theater. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Right. Back pain and fatigue. We need to differentiate normal aging from something potentially more significant. Let's start with the back pain. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Describe it… It’s…dull. Like a weight. Not sharp, not stinging. Just… there. Mostly when I bend over. Or…lift things. Though I don't lift much these days. Not like I used to. Carrying all those…props and…wigs. Heavy things. It's better when I sit. Though sitting for too long is not good either. I get… fidgety.
DOCTOR: So, a dull ache, exacerbated by bending and lifting, relieved somewhat by sitting, but prolonged sitting causes restlessness. And how long have you been experiencing this back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a long time. Years, I think. Maybe…since the divorce. It’s all a blur. She… always complained about my back. Said I wasn’t strong enough to carry the…everything. The costumes, the makeup… everything. I don't know. It’s been a long time. Before I moved, it was…worse, probably. Less quiet. Less…peaceful.
DOCTOR: Right. Years of intermittent back pain. And you mentioned fatigue. Is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I would say. Not like I can't do things, you know? I can still do my makeup. And I walk to the store. But… afterwards, I need to sit. For a long time. It’s like… the energy is just gone. And I don’t sleep well every night. Sometimes I wake up…thinking about things. Bad things. Old things. The theater was…demanding. Very demanding.
DOCTOR: Constant fatigue, exacerbated by activity, associated with difficulty sleeping and… ruminating thoughts. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll need to palpate your back to assess the pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Palpate…? You want to… touch my back? Oh. Well… alright. I suppose. If you must. But be gentle. It’s…sensitive. I don’t like being touched, really. Never have. Especially not my back. It's a… private area.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on the table, face down. I will be as gentle as possible. We need to rule out any structural issues contributing to your discomfort.
PATIENT: Structural issues… This is… unnecessary, isn’t it? I just wanted a check-up. Medicare sent me. All this… poking and prodding. I preferred it when I just had to worry about the lighting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I'm feeling your spine now. Can you tell me if this is particularly tender?
PATIENT: Oof! Yes. There. Right…there. And a little bit to the left. It's always been sore there. Like a knot. She used to rub it, actually. Said it was a muscle. But it never felt like just a muscle. It feels… deeper. Like a bone. Be careful! Don't press too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. I also notice some slight muscle spasm in the lower back. Your range of motion appears slightly limited. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please.
PATIENT: In… out… This is… unnerving. All these instruments. You’re poking and prodding and… listening. What are you listening for? Bad things? I don’t like this. I really don't like this. The theater was stressful, but at least I knew what was happening.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Mr. Szmyd. No concerning sounds detected. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this hammer. It’s perfectly normal, and doesn’t hurt much.
PATIENT: Hammer?! You're going to hit me with a hammer? No, no, absolutely not! I don't want to be hit with anything! This is… assault! I demand to see a lawyer! This is not a check-up, this is torture!
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, please remain calm. It's a reflex hammer, not a striking hammer. It's a standard part of a neurological exam to assess nerve function. It's a very gentle tap. However, if you are this distressed, we can forego that portion of the exam. We need to discuss your blood pressure, however. Can you sit up slowly?
PATIENT: Blood pressure is fine. I'm sure of it. I drink tea. Lots of tea. Calming tea. Chamomile. It lowers blood pressure. I don't need to be poked and prodded. I just wanted a simple check-up. Medicare sent me, remember? This is all very… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Your blood pressure is, in fact, slightly elevated: 148/92. That is above the optimal range. Given your reported fatigue, chronic back pain, and elevated blood pressure, I recommend some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues. We will check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid, and cholesterol levels. Additionally, I'm going to recommend a Vitamin D level. Low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue and muscle pain. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Is it…painful? I don't like needles. Never have. And all those… things you mentioned. Electrolytes… thyroid… What even are electrolytes? This is too much information. I just want to go home and drink some tea. Maybe watch television.
DOCTOR: The blood draw involves a small needle prick, Mr. Szmyd. It’s typically brief discomfort. As for electrolytes, they are minerals in your body that help regulate fluid balance, nerve signals, and muscle contractions. Essentially, they are important for many bodily functions. We need to check these levels to ensure everything is functioning optimally. Given your reluctance, we can start with just the Vitamin D level if you prefer. It's a simple test and may shed some light on your fatigue. However, I strongly recommend the complete blood work for a more comprehensive assessment. What will it be?
PATIENT: Just the Vitamin D then. That's all. Just the Vitamin D. I don't want anything else. It's… enough. I'm tired. Very tired. And I don't like needles. So just the Vitamin D, please. And then… can I go home?
DOCTOR: Very well. I've ordered a Vitamin D level. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take a small blood sample. I’m also going to recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. And, Mr. Szmyd, I strongly suggest you consider incorporating some gentle exercise into your routine, such as walking. And watch your salt intake. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… when can I go home? This has been… a lot. And walking… I do walk. To the store. Isn’t that enough? And salt… I like salt. On my tea. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: You may go home now, Mr. Szmyd. Yes, walking to the store is some exercise. But regular, dedicated physical activity is more beneficial. And, while I cannot recommend adding salt to your tea given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I will not forbid it. Here's a lab requisition. The nurse will provide you with aftercare instructions. Please schedule a follow-up appointment with my office. Have a…day. .
