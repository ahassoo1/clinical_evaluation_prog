DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my bruising. It’s been getting worse, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and I just seem to be covered in these… marks. It’s quite bothersome. I don’t understand why it’s happening now, though. I’ve been on it for years.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing increased bruising despite being on a blood thinner for some time now. That is concerning, and it's good you brought it to my attention. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, they just… appear. Not always from bumping into things, which is the irritating part. A little pressure, sometimes nothing at all, and poof, there’s a bruise. Mostly on my arms, I think. And legs. It’s not like I’m getting beaten, Doctor. I just want to know why this is suddenly happening. I take my medication like I’m supposed to. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Bruising appearing spontaneously, or with minimal trauma, is definitely something we need to investigate. And it’s good you’re diligent about taking your medication as prescribed. First, let’s talk about the medication itself. What blood thinner are you currently taking, and what is the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh, dosages. Honestly, I don't remember the exact number. Something with a "milligram" in it, I think? It's… Warfarin, yes, that’s it. Warfarin. The doctor back in the city prescribed it, years ago. I just keep refilling the prescription. They send it to the pharmacy here. It’s a small, white pill. I take one every evening with dinner. Is that enough information? I really don't keep track of these things. It's the bruising that's bothering me, not the name of the pill.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and you’re right to focus on the bruising. It’s perfectly alright not to remember the exact dosage. We can verify that with the pharmacy records here. Okay, I see here you're taking 5 milligrams of Warfarin daily. Now, have you had any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same old aches and pains. A bit of trouble sleeping, but that’s been going on for ages. I haven’t been sick, haven’t fallen, haven’t started any new… hobbies or anything. I mostly just read and watch the news. It’s all rather depressing these days, if you ask me. But that’s beside the point. The bruising. Is it the Warfarin? Should I just stop taking it? I don't like being covered in these marks. It’s undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the bruising and wanting to know if the Warfarin is the cause. It is possible, but there are other things we need to rule out before making any changes to your medication. Stopping Warfarin abruptly can be dangerous, so we absolutely won’t do that without a thorough evaluation. Let’s go through a brief review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Well… I had my gallbladder removed, years and years ago. And I had a bit of a heart flutter once, but they gave me some pills for that and it’s been fine ever since. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a fairly healthy man for my age. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke… I just seem to bruise easily these days. It’s very perplexing. And frankly, a bit worrying. I don’t want to end up in the hospital because of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of atrial fibrillation treated with medication. That’s helpful. And it's good you’re proactive about your health and concerned about potential complications. Now, concerning your family history, are there any bleeding disorders or easy bruising tendencies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she used to bruise rather easily, now that I think about it. But she also fell a lot. She was a bit clumsy, to be honest. My father… no, not that I recall. He was a very sturdy man. A farmer. Never sick a day in his life. So, maybe my mother? It was a long time ago, though. I don’t really remember the details. It’s not like we talked about… bruising. It wasn't considered a serious topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible family history of easy bruising through your mother. That's something to consider. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Besides reading and watching the news, are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Employed? No, Doctor. Not anymore. I was a pathologist, you see. Retired years ago. It was a demanding profession. Long hours, a lot of responsibility. I’m glad that part of my life is over. I mostly keep to myself these days. Quiet life. Which is why this… bruising is so disruptive. It's not like I'm doing anything strenuous. I'm a retired pathologist. Not a construction worker.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. A quiet retirement is certainly deserved after a demanding career. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m not one of those people with a long list of sensitivities. I just want to know what’s causing these bruises. It’s quite frustrating, Doctor. I’m a man of science. I like to understand things. And this… this is perplexing. It’s a mystery! And I don’t like mysteries.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your scientific mindset, Mr. Farson. It's good to know you don't have any known allergies. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to take a look at the bruises themselves, check your blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can discuss potential blood tests to help us figure out what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, please. And explain what you’re doing. I like to know what’s happening. It’s the uncertainty that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I see several bruises in varying stages of healing. Some are quite new, appearing reddish-purple, while others are more yellow-brown, indicating they are older. They're mostly on your forearms and upper arms, as you mentioned. I don't see any signs of trauma or injury, which is consistent with your report. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any obvious causes for the bruising. That's why we'll need some blood tests to investigate further. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, not really. It all sounds… normal. Which is frustrating! If it’s all normal, what’s causing the bruises? That’s what I want to know. What kind of blood tests are you thinking of? Something to check the Warfarin levels, I presume? And… what else? I don’t want a million tubes of blood drawn, if possible. I get a bit faint, you see. It's an age thing.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the Warfarin levels – that’s definitely a priority. We’ll check your INR to see if you’re within the therapeutic range. But since the bruising is unexplained, we also need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check your platelet count and white blood cell count. A basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function, and a liver function panel to check your liver health. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any underlying issues that could be contributing to the bruising. It won't be a million tubes of blood, Mr. Farson, just a standard set of tests. And we'll take it slowly to minimize any risk of you feeling faint. We have a comfortable chair and a cool compress available if needed. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it’s not an excessive amount. And if I start to feel… unwell, please stop immediately. I’m not a fan of needles, you see. Never have been. But if it’s necessary to figure out what’s going on, I suppose I can endure it. Just… be quick about it, if possible. And explain what you’re doing each step of the way. It’s the uncertainty that bothers me the most. Where do we draw the blood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. I will explain each step as we go, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And we will stop immediately if you start to feel unwell. We’ll draw the blood right here, in this chair. Our phlebotomist, Maria, is very experienced and gentle. She will start by cleaning the inside of your elbow with an antiseptic wipe. Then she’ll tie a tourniquet around your upper arm to make your veins more visible. Finally, she’ll insert a needle into your vein to collect the blood samples. It will only take a few minutes. Maria will be in shortly. In the meantime, do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m alright. Just… get it over with. And please, make sure the needle is… a sharp one. I’ve had bad experiences in the past with dull needles. It’s quite unpleasant. And tell Maria to be gentle. Very gentle. I’m a retired pathologist, not a construction worker. I'm not accustomed to rough handling. Honestly, the whole thing is rather… undignified. But if it's necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Just… hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. I will personally speak with Maria and emphasize the importance of using a sharp needle and being extremely gentle. We will ensure you are as comfortable as possible throughout the process. Maria, could you please come in and draw some blood for Mr. Farson?
