DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my…well, my business. Been seeing blood, you see. In the stool. Not a good sign, is it? I used to fly these fancy jets, you know. Kept everything ship-shape. Body should be the same, shouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool…right. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…a week, maybe? A little longer. Hard to keep track when you’re…well, when you’re not as sharp as you used to be. It’s not constant, mind you. Just…appearances. And it's bright red, if that means anything. Not like some murky mess.
DOCTOR: Bright red, intermittent…Okay. And is it just a spot, or more than that?
PATIENT: More than a spot, Doctor. Definitely more. Not buckets, thankfully, but enough to cause a bit of…concern. A sensible man would be concerned, wouldn’t he? And I am a sensible man. Used to navigate by the stars, I did.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any change in your bowel habits along with this?
PATIENT: Change? Well, everything slows down when you get to my age, doesn’t it? But…thinking about it…yes. A bit looser, perhaps. Not solid like it should be. And I've had to…go more often. Used to have a schedule, you know? Everything was punctual. This is…disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools, increased frequency…And are you experiencing any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A little bit of rumbling, now and then. Nothing to write home about. Mostly it's just…unsettling. Like something's not quite right. I've had worse when turbulence hit, mind you. But this is…different. Constant, in a way. And it's my body. I should know what’s normal for it.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or nausea recently?
PATIENT: Nausea? No, Doctor. I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Fever... can't say I've been feeling particularly warm, but I don't go sticking thermometers in my mouth anymore. Used to be able to tell a head cold by the way the air smelled in the cockpit. That's a skill they don't teach doctors these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. That’s a good question. My wife used to keep track of everything. Said I was getting a bit…substantial. Haven’t been on the scales since…well, since she left, to be honest. Probably a bit lighter. But that could be the worry, couldn't it?
DOCTOR: It could be. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Known conditions? Well, I had a bit of trouble with my back when I was flying – all that jolting around. And my knees aren’t what they used to be. Nothing serious. Good strong constitution, I always had. Never smoked, never drank much. My wife, now she liked a sherry…
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Let me think…had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was…ages ago. And got a bit of shrapnel removed during the war. Nothing major. A small price to pay for keeping the skies safe, wouldn’t you say? And a mole removed from my back a few years back, just a precaution, the doctor said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…well, my father lived to a good age, but he wasn’t exactly…robust. Bit of a sickly fellow, if I’m honest. Mother was strong as an ox. But she died young, complications from childbirth. And my sister, she had…well, I don’t recall exactly what she had. Something with her stomach, I think. Not a pleasant business. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. I don't hold with all those pills. A little bit of rest, a sensible diet…that’s all a man needs. My wife, she was always popping something for this and that. Never did her any good. I've always prided myself on my constitution. Still do, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Rowbottom, given your symptoms – the blood in your stool, change in bowel habits – and your age, I think it’s important we investigate this further. It could be a number of things. Hemorrhoids, a diverticulitis flare-up, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and then I’m going to order some tests. A stool sample, a blood test, and I’m going to recommend a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now, hold on just a minute. Stick things where? At my age? I’ve had enough poking and prodding in my life, thank you very much. All that fuss for a bit of blood? Seems a bit… excessive, doesn’t it? I’d rather just…monitor it, see if it clears up on its own. I've gotten myself out of tighter spots than this, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, “monitoring it” isn’t a safe approach in this situation. Bright red blood in the stool, especially with a change in bowel habits, can be a sign of something significant, like colon cancer. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting and preventing these issues. It's a relatively straightforward procedure, and we'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible. We're talking about your health here, and it’s far better to be proactive.
PATIENT: Colon cancer, you say? Hmph. Well, my father…he wasn’t exactly a picture of health. But I’ve always been strong. Always been able to take care of myself. Still… a procedure, you say? What does that entail exactly? I’ve never had anything like that done before. And what about the discomfort? I’m not a young man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me explain. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to view the entire colon. You'll be sedated, so you won’t feel any discomfort during the procedure. Beforehand, you'll need to clear your bowels completely – we’ll give you specific instructions on that. It takes about 30-60 minutes. Afterwards, you may experience some gas and bloating, but it’s usually mild. It’s the most thorough way to check for polyps, tumors, or other abnormalities. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, but I strongly recommend it, given your symptoms and your age. Ignoring this could have serious consequences, Mr. Rowbottom.
PATIENT: Hmph. Sedated, you say? That… that sounds a bit better. Still don't like the idea of poking around in there, but…serious consequences, you say? Alright. I suppose if it's the only way to be sure… I still think it's a bit much fuss for a bit of blood, but…very well. I’ll agree to the… procedure. But you’ll have to explain everything very clearly. And I want a very competent doctor doing it. None of your students, understand?
DOCTOR: Good. I understand. I will personally oversee the procedure, and we'll explain everything step-by-step. We'll schedule you for a consultation with Dr. Elara Vance, she’s our leading gastroenterologist. She'll go over the prep instructions, risks, and benefits in detail. And then we can schedule the colonoscopy itself. I'll get the referral paperwork started right away. In the meantime, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool sample to rule out any infection. We'll need to get that done as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: A stool sample… more indignity. Very well. Yes, I do have a question. This Dr. Vance… is she… experienced? I don’t want some fresh-faced youngster learning on my insides. And what about the sedation? What exactly will I be given? I've always had a strong constitution, but I don’t react well to… things.
DOCTOR: Dr. Vance has over 15 years of experience in gastroenterology, and is highly regarded. She’s very thorough and excellent at explaining things. As for the sedation, we typically use a combination of midazolam – a calming medication – and fentanyl for pain relief. It’s a light sedation, meaning you’ll be awake but very relaxed and won't remember much of the procedure. We monitor your vital signs closely throughout the entire process. However, as you rightly point out, everyone reacts differently, and we will take your history into account. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had much trouble with pills. I’m a strong man, as I’ve said. But… fentanyl, you say? Isn't that… powerful? I read something about that… in the papers. People getting… addicted.
DOCTOR: The fentanyl we administer during a colonoscopy is a very controlled dose, specifically for pain management during a short procedure. It's not the same as long-term, chronic pain management. The risk of addiction is extremely low in this context. We carefully monitor you afterwards and wouldn't discharge you until we're satisfied you’re fully recovered and stable. It's a safe medication when administered correctly, and the benefits of pain relief during the colonoscopy far outweigh the minimal risk in this situation. We'll also discuss alternative sedation options if you're still concerned. But to reiterate, the amount used is very small and short-acting. Now, let’s focus on getting this stool sample and blood work scheduled. Do you have a preference for a lab location?
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. If you say it’s safe… I suppose I have no choice. Alright. As for the lab… somewhere close would be best. My knees aren't what they used to be. And I don't drive anymore. Can you recommend somewhere nearby? I don't fancy a long journey for a bit of… you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. There’s a lab right across the street, within the same complex. It’s called Suburban Diagnostics. I'll print you a requisition form for both the stool sample and the blood work, along with the address and operating hours. It's on the ground floor, so no stairs. And they take walk-ins, but you might want to call ahead just to avoid a long wait. Here you go. The paperwork is all filled out except for your signature. Do you have any questions about filling it out or getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Right. Suburban Diagnostics… across the street. No stairs, you say? Good. My knees will appreciate that. This seems… a lot of fuss for a bit of blood, but… very well. I’ll go do as you say. But I expect good results, Doctor. And I expect to be treated with respect. I may be old, but I'm still a man, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. We treat all our patients with respect. Just take these to Suburban Diagnostics as soon as possible. Once the results are back, we'll contact you to schedule the consultation with Dr. Vance. I'll make a note in your chart to prioritize this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just… please make sure Dr. Vance is aware of my… concerns. And that she’s a competent doctor. I don't want any surprises. I suppose I'll be going now. This whole business is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Right. We will ensure Dr. Vance is fully briefed on your concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Rowbottom. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: .
