DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? I don’t… I don’t really know what’s wrong, but it’s not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. I understand. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. Not… not long, I don’t think. Maybe… a week? Or more? It’s hard to say, really. Things… they all kind of blend together, you know? I just… woke up with it, feeling bad.
DOCTOR: I do understand, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly when things started. So, about a week or so of sinus pressure. Can you describe the pressure?
PATIENT: Um… it feels… full. Like… a lot of stuff is inside my head. Especially… here, and here. Not… pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. And… sometimes it feels like… something is dripping. But I don’t know if that's from my nose or… somewhere else. It's a little confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness in your forehead and cheeks, and a sensation of dripping. Is the dripping clear, or is there any color to it?
PATIENT: Oh… color. I… I haven’t really looked, Doctor. I’m sorry. I just… wipe it away. It feels… watery, I think. Not… thick. I don't really pay attention, if that makes sense. It just… happens. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mikeisha. It's not bad at all. Many people don't routinely check the color. Just trying to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any fever, or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but… I don’t have a thermometer. And… chills? No, not really. I get cold sometimes, but… that's just because I’m always cold. My husband says I’m always cold. But… not chills, like shaking or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms, like a cough, sore throat, or headache?
PATIENT: A little… headache, yes. Not a bad one, just… dull. Like… pressure, all over. And… maybe a little cough. Just… when I lay down, mostly. Not… a big cough. More of a… tickle. It's not keeping me up at night or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, so dull headache and a mild cough when you lay down. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… I don’t really pay attention to smells and tastes. I cook, of course, but… I don’t notice if things smell different. My husband, he’s the one with the good nose. I haven’t noticed anything… wrong, but… I haven’t looked for anything, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mikeisha. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… significant illnesses… I don’t think so. Nothing… big. I had the flu, I think, a few times. And… when I was a little girl, I had… chickenpox? I think that's what it was. But… that was a long time ago. And… no surgeries. Never had any surgeries. I think that’s it. Nothing… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses or surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mama, she had… problems with her stomach, I think. But… I don’t know what kind of problems. She’s gone now. And my papa, he was… healthy, mostly. He liked to work hard. No… no one in my family had… sinus problems, I don’t think. Or… if they did, they didn’t talk about it. It's been a long time. I don't remember much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications. Not… anything. I don’t like taking pills. And… allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never… reacted badly to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I touch… certain flowers, but… that’s not really an allergy, is it? Just… a little itchy. Nothing serious. I don't think I have any real allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or known allergies. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and look in your ears and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My ears are… sensitive sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, lungs sound clear. Ears look normal, a little bit of wax, but nothing significant. Your throat is a little red, but no signs of strep or any other obvious infection. I also feel some tenderness around your sinuses when I press on your forehead and cheeks.
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… good to know, I guess. So… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? Is it something… serious? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like anything immediately serious, Mikeisha. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a sinus infection, or sinusitis. The redness in your throat could be from postnasal drip, which happens when mucus drains down the back of your throat. Now, often these can clear up on their own with supportive care, like rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. But, because you've been feeling this way for about a week, and we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet, I’d like to recommend a course of action. Would you be comfortable getting a basic blood test to rule out any other possibilities and confirm this isn't something else?
PATIENT: A blood test? Um… I don’t… I don’t really like needles, Doctor. And… I don’t have insurance. Would it… cost a lot of money? I just… I’m not sure I can afford that right now. Is it really necessary? Maybe… maybe the rest and fluids will be enough?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mikeisha. I understand your hesitation, and the financial aspect is important. A blood test isn't absolutely essential, but it would help us be certain. It's to rule out things like a more serious infection or other causes for your symptoms. We can absolutely proceed without it if you're uncomfortable, and try the supportive care approach first - plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. We can also try a nasal saline rinse to help clear out your sinuses. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they get worse – fever develops, severe headache, facial swelling – then we’d need to investigate further. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… better. No blood test right now. Just… rest and fluids and… the rinse. And… what kind of rinse? Do I need to buy something special? I don’t know where to go to buy things like that. And… how often should I do it? I want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can purchase a saline nasal rinse kit at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even some grocery stores. They’re usually pretty inexpensive. Alternatively, you can make your own by mixing 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized salt with 8 ounces of warm water. It’s very important to use distilled or sterilized water, not tap water, to avoid any potential infection. I recommend using the rinse 2-3 times a day, especially when you're feeling congested. It might feel a little strange at first, but it helps clear out the mucus and relieve pressure. Do you have any questions about how to use the rinse?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Warm water, a little salt, and… rinse my nose. Distilled water, you said? Not just tap water? Okay. And… how long should I rinse for? Just… a little bit? I don’t want to… hurt myself. I've never done this before.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask! Yes, distilled or sterilized water is important. And you’re very careful to ask good questions. You only need to rinse for about 30 seconds per nostril. Gently insert the nozzle into your nostril and squeeze the bottle, allowing the saline solution to flow through. Don’t force it. It should be a gentle, comfortable flow. There are lots of helpful videos online that can demonstrate the proper technique if you’d like. Just search for “saline nasal rinse” on YouTube. We’ll try this for a week. If your symptoms aren't improving, or if they get worse, please call the office to schedule another appointment. I also want you to monitor for any fever, severe headache, facial swelling, or changes in vision. Those would be reasons to seek medical attention right away. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. A week of rinsing, and… watch for bad things. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I hope… I hope this works. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right to be proactive, and you’re already doing a great job by asking questions. I’m optimistic this will provide some relief. Here’s a printed handout with instructions on saline nasal rinsing, just in case you forget anything. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Mikeisha. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
