DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Please, have a seat. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Chagaris. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve just been getting the chills lately. It’s a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, “just cold” – I understand. That can be unsettling. And you said "lately," could you tell me a little more about when this started, and if anything seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started maybe a week ago? It’s hard to say exactly. It doesn’t really seem to get worse with anything, it’s just…there. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but I thought that was just because of work, you know? I don’t really notice anything that makes it better either, to be honest. It just comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about a week ago, intermittent chills without any worsening factors, and some fatigue you’ve attributed to work. That’s helpful. Just to clarify, when you say chills, do you mean shivering, or just feeling cold when others don't?
PATIENT: Oh, good question! It’s not really shivering, no. More like…a coldness inside? Like I need a sweater even when it’s warm. It's not goosebumps or anything, just…a general feeling of being cold. It’s hard to explain!
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a very good way to describe it – a general feeling of coldness. And it’s not accompanied by shivering or other typical cold symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No sore throat, no cough, no stuffy nose…nothing like that. Just the chills and the tiredness. I haven’t taken my temperature or anything, but I don't feel feverish. I’ve been drinking lots of water, just in case. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe I’ve been a little more thirsty than usual?
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills, fatigue, and perhaps increased thirst – no other cold symptoms like cough, sore throat, or nasal congestion. No fever that you’re aware of. Thank you for clarifying. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. We’ll go through a quick review of your overall health. First, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. No problem. Let’s see… Significant medical problems… Hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that was pretty significant at the time! And… honestly, not much else. I usually stay pretty healthy. Oh! I was diagnosed with mild anemia a few years back, but it’s been managed with iron supplements, and my doctor said it was under control.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager and mild anemia managed with iron supplements. That's good to know. Are you currently taking those iron supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take one tablet every other day. It’s just a habit now, really. My doctor said I could probably stop, but I figured it couldn’t hurt to keep going. Just being careful, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. Just the iron, like I said. Sometimes I take a vitamin C tablet when I feel a cold coming on, but that’s it. Definitely nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just the iron supplement and occasional vitamin C. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to any medicines I've ever taken. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, um… my mum has high blood pressure, she’s been on medication for years. And my dad… he had diabetes, type 2, but he managed it pretty well with diet and exercise. He passed away a few years ago, sadly. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. Oh! And my grandmother on my mum’s side had arthritis. That's about all I can think of right now, honestly. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. High blood pressure in your mother, type 2 diabetes in your father, and arthritis in your grandmother. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as a Health Education Specialist, so I’m on my feet a lot during the day, talking to people. It can be pretty busy. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, but sometimes it’s hard with my schedule. I don’t really have a lot of time for exercise, unfortunately. I walk to work sometimes when the weather is nice, but that’s about it. I used to go to the gym, but I haven’t been in months. And I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A busy job, you try to eat healthily, but time is limited for exercise. No smoking, social drinking only. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. No aches or pains. I occasionally get a bit of a headache if I’m stressed, but nothing major. Just the normal kind, you know? Nothing that over-the-counter medication can't handle.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse, and take a quick look in your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. No problem at all. Let me know if anything feels weird, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Temperature is 37.2 degrees Celsius – that's within the normal range. Blood pressure is 128/78, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute. Throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Ears are clear as well. I’m noting a slightly elevated resting heart rate, but that could be related to your activity level. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we should consider. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Yeah, I'm happy to do that, if you think it's best. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, right? What exactly will those tests show? Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. The complete blood count will give us information about your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help us identify signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. The basic metabolic panel will measure your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood glucose. It can help us assess your overall metabolic health. It usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back from the lab. I will call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, getting plenty of rest, and continuing to eat a healthy diet. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, cough, or other new symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Staying hydrated, rest, and healthy eating. And contact you if things get worse. Okay, I can do that. So, just to be clear, we're mainly looking to rule things out with the tests? Is there anything specific you're worried about? I don't want to overthink, but it's always good to know, right?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. You are correct—primarily, we're using these tests to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. While a viral infection is likely, given your intermittent chills and fatigue, we want to ensure there’s no underlying issue, such as an electrolyte imbalance, kidney dysfunction, or a more subtle infection. We also want to re-evaluate your iron levels, as that was a past concern. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. We are aiming to have a more definitive understanding of what’s going on and create the best plan for your well-being. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been really helpful, Dr. Chagaris. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So, just wait for the call, and if anything gets worse, I’ll let you know. Okay. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns at all before I call with the results. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they will assist you with scheduling the blood draw. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Chagaris. You have a good day too.
