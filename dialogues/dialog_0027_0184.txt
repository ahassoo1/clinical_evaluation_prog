DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Or… is it Kern?
PATIENT: Morning. Just Kern is fine. Look, I ain't got all day, doc. I got things to do. This body thing is… well, it's botherin' me, and I want to get it sorted. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, of course. Quickly is good. I understand. Just… tell me, Kern, what exactly is botherin’ you?
PATIENT: It's… lookin' old, alright? I used to be strong. Pile drivin’ ain’t easy work, you know. And now… well, now I just look… soft. Everything's droopin' where it shouldn't, and nothin’ is firm. My wife… she liked things a certain way, and I'd like to get back to that. You understand what I mean? It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I… I believe I understand. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes in your physical appearance, and how that's affecting you. Changes with age… they’re common. We can certainly explore some options. Now, when did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It started… maybe a year or so after Beatrice passed. She always said I kept myself fit. Kept everything tight. After she went… well, I stopped botherin’ so much, I suppose. Just didn't have the… motivation. And then, slowly, things started… shiftin’. A year, maybe a year and a half. Hard to say exactly. Time kinda blurs when you're alone, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can understand that. A significant loss… it impacts everything. And it’s not unusual for changes in lifestyle to affect physical well-being. You mentioned a change in lifestyle… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I retired, for one. Pile drivin’ is… strenuous. Couldn't do it forever. And after Beatrice… I stopped goin’ to the gym. Stopped watchin’ what I ate, really. Used to be strict. Now… it’s just easier to have what I want, when I want it. Not much point in lookin’ good if there's nobody to look at, is there?
DOCTOR: I see. A change in routine, diet… and perhaps a bit of diminished… self-care. That’s perfectly understandable, Kern. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with these changes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick? No, no sickness. Just… displeased with the mirror. Sometimes my joints ache a bit, especially in the mornin', but that's just old age, I reckon. I ain't complainin' about pain. I just want to look… presentable again. Like I used to. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Kern, that's not too much to ask at all. We can certainly explore some options to help you feel more like yourself. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife… she was the one with the sensitivities. Pollen, mostly. I always breathed easy, though. Always a strong constitution, me.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, the doc gave it to me last year. Small blue pill. Can't remember the name, never bothered to learn it. Just take it every mornin', that's all. And sometimes, when my joints are achin’ particularly bad, I take one of them… what do you call 'em… ibuprofen? Is that right? The white ones.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, yes. And you mentioned a medication for blood pressure. We’ll look that up in your records. Now, Kern, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? What kinda exam? I ain't lookin' to get poked and prodded all over. I just want to know if you can fix things, not have you lookin' at every wrinkle.
DOCTOR: No, not a full, exhaustive exam, Kern. Just a quick look at your overall health – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment. It helps me understand what options might be best for you. We can focus on the areas you’re concerned about. It’s a standard part of the process, and it won’t be unpleasant. It’s just to ensure there aren't any underlying medical conditions contributing to your concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick, doc. I really haven't got all day. And no pokin' around in… sensitive areas. I’m a modest man. Just the basics, alright? Blood pressure and listenin’ and that’s it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kern. Just the basics. Blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. We'll keep it quick and respectful. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. Alright, just relax your arm for me… good. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart…
PATIENT: Hmph. Elevated, you say? Probably just from all the talkin'. I get agitated easy, see? Always have. Just get on with it, doc. I want to know what can be done.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, just a quick feel of your abdomen… everything feels normal here. No tenderness or masses. And just checking your pulse in your feet… good circulation. Okay. Overall, you seem to be in reasonably good health for your age, Kern. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we’ll monitor, but they don’t seem to be the primary cause of your concerns. Now, regarding your concerns about your appearance... There are a number of options we can explore. Lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, can make a significant difference. There are also some medical treatments available, but they come with risks and benefits. Would you like me to discuss these options with you?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? I just told you, I ain't got the motivation! And I don’t want to hear about risks and benefits. Just tell me… can you fix the droopin’? Can you make me look… tighter? Like I used to be? That’s all I care about. No fancy talk, doc. Just a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Kern, I understand your frustration. You want a quick and easy solution, and I wish I could offer you one. But the truth is, restoring your appearance to exactly how it used to be… it’s not always possible, and it’s rarely simple. There are procedures like skin tightening, and potentially fillers or injectables that could help improve the appearance of drooping skin. However, these procedures are not without risk, and the results are not always guaranteed. There is also the cost to consider. Before we discuss those options further, I would like to be upfront about my recommendation. I believe the best course of action is to start with a comprehensive assessment of your overall health, including blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It's important to ensure you are a good candidate for any procedure. Would you be open to that, Kern?
PATIENT: Blood work? More pokin’ and proddin’? Look, doc, I’m tellin’ you, I’m fine! I just want the droopin’ fixed. You think I got time for blood work? I’m an old man! I ain’t lookin’ to spend my last days in a doctor’s office. If you can’t fix it with somethin’ quick and easy, then just tell me straight. I’ll find someone who can.
DOCTOR: Kern, I understand your frustration and your desire for a quick solution. But I am ethically obligated to ensure your safety and well-being. Proceeding with any procedure without a proper assessment could be harmful. I am not comfortable recommending any procedure without first ruling out any underlying medical conditions. It's not about wasting your time, it's about making sure you are a safe candidate and that the procedure will have the best possible outcome. If you are unwilling to undergo a basic health assessment, then I regret to inform you that I am unable to provide you with the treatment you are seeking. I can, however, provide you with a referral to another physician if you wish. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but my priority is always the health and safety of my patients.
PATIENT: Hmph. So you're tellin' me you can't help me? After all this talk? You're just wastin' my time. Fine. I'll find someone else. Someone who understands what I want. Don't bother with a referral. I can find a doctor myself.
DOCTOR: Very well, Kern. I understand. I wish you the best in finding a physician who can meet your needs. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to contact the office.
