DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Yackey. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s ridiculous I even have to be here. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve never needed a doctor for…this. But I’m just so tired all the time now. And…well, I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, just…a little. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, specifically. From the garden, mostly. Don’t look at me like that, young man. It’s not like I’m enjoying it. It just…feels good going down. And when I don't have it, I feel…worse. More tired, if that’s possible. It’s a craving, alright? A very strange craving.
DOCTOR: Right. A craving for…clay. Ms. Hardenburgh, I must ask, for how long have you been experiencing this…urge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around the time the weather started getting warmer, I suppose. It wasn’t constant at first, just a little nibble here and there when I was weeding. Now…well, now I find myself thinking about it most days. It’s getting worse, that’s for sure. And the tiredness… it’s really dragging me down. I used to be so active!
DOCTOR: And you've noticed no other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? What do you mean? I'm 79, things are always changing! My knees ache more, I sleep less… is that what you mean? No, nothing else really. Just the dirt-eating and the exhaustion. It’s not like I’m seeing things or anything. Honestly, I just want to know why I’m doing this. It’s…undignified.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. You're asking a lot of personal questions, aren't you? Well, no, not really. My stomach feels a bit… unsettled sometimes, now that you mention it. But that could be anything, honestly. I eat a lot of different things. And no changes in…well, you know. Everything’s pretty regular, if you must know.
DOCTOR: And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Diet? I eat. What kind of answer is that? I eat what I like. Mostly vegetables from the garden, some fish when I can get it. I don't go in for all that processed stuff, you know. Everything in moderation. Except for… well, never mind. It's not like I'm living on junk food. I try to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Do you take any vitamins or supplements, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Supplements? Goodness no. All those fancy pills? I get everything I need from my food. And sunshine. I used to spend hours in the garden, but I haven't been able to lately, not with feeling so tired all the time. Everything’s just…a struggle now.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's likely a nutritional deficiency, though it's difficult to say definitively without some bloodwork. I’ll order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, as well as iron studies. We'll need to rule out anemia and electrolyte imbalances.
PATIENT: Electrolyte…what now? Look, are you going to tell me what’s wrong with me, or just keep throwing medical words at me? I don't need a lecture, I just want to know what’s causing this and how to fix it. And honestly, I don't have a lot of time for tests.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I am attempting to ascertain the cause of your unusual symptoms. Eating dirt is not normal, and it requires investigation. The tests will help me determine if there's a physiological reason for this behavior. It’s standard procedure. I'll have the lab draw the blood now, and we can discuss the results when they come back. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you talk to me like that! I've lived a long life and seen plenty of doctors who didn't treat me like I was stupid. I understand perfectly well you want to run tests, but I'm telling you, I don’t have time for a lot of back and forth. Just tell me where to go to get this blood drawn and let's be done with it.
DOCTOR: Fine. The lab is just down the hall to your left. They’ll need a requisition form, which the receptionist has already prepared. I expect you to follow up with me as soon as you receive the results. And please, try to refrain from consuming any more…clay…until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. .
PATIENT: .
