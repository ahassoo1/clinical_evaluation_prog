DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, yes? A good name. I… well, I just moved here, see? New place. Doctor told me I need to… check in with someone. Medicare thing, I think. Old doctor… back home… he was good. Very good. Not like these new ones. Just a check-up, I guess? Nothing bad, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to establish care with a new physician after a move, and Medicare does often require that. We'll certainly do a thorough check-up. It sounds like you’re hoping this is just a general wellness visit. To get started, could you tell me a little more about why your previous doctor recommended you find someone here?
PATIENT: Oh, um… recommended? He didn't exactly recommend. He… he retired, see? Just… stopped taking patients. Everyone had to find someone else. It was a bit of a rush, honestly. I didn't really choose to find someone new, he just… wasn’t there anymore. And my wife… well, she would always make the appointments. Before… everything. I don’t remember exactly why he wanted me to see a doctor regularly, now that I think about it. Something about… my face? Is that important? I work with faces all the time.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Szmyd. It can be unsettling when a trusted doctor retires unexpectedly. And it's very common to not recall all the details, especially with everything else you've been managing. You mentioned something about your face. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. I do makeup, you see? For the theater. Big productions. Used to be very famous ones, too. Lots of… bright lights. And powders. And… well, I’m around people’s faces all day. Touching them. Making them look… better. He… the old doctor… he said something about needing to check the… skin. Something about the lights and powders. He was always fussing about something. Probably nothing. Old doctors always fuss. Though, now that I think about it, my skin does feel a little dry sometimes. But that's the air, isn't it? This place is so… humid.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Working with theatrical makeup does expose you to certain potential irritants, and prolonged exposure to lights can also have an effect. You're right, it could be the humidity as well. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any specific changes to your skin – any new moles, sores that aren’t healing, or areas of unusual discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… unusual discomfort… No, not really. Maybe a little itch sometimes, but that’s probably just… dust. Lots of dust in the theater. Old place, you see? Very old. And the costumes… itchy materials. No sores, no… what did you call them? Moles? I think I have a few. Everyone has a few, right? Little brown spots. Not new, though. I've had those for years. My wife… she used to point them out. Always fussing about something. I really don't pay attention to my skin much. Too busy making other people’s faces look good. Is this important, Doctor? Are we looking for something bad? You're making me nervous now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve had those moles for years, Mr. Szmyd. That’s generally a good sign. And you’re right to ask if it's important. I ask because certain skin conditions can be more common with prolonged exposure to lights and chemicals, and it’s best to rule things out. It doesn't necessarily mean we're looking for something bad, just being cautious. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your skin, just to get a better idea?
PATIENT: A quick look? Hmm… I suppose so. But don't fuss too much, Doctor. I've had a lot of makeup on my face over the years. It's probably just… dried powder. And old age. Everything gets old, you know? But… be gentle, alright? My skin is… sensitive. From all the makeup, you see. And… honestly, it reminds me of my wife doing it. She was very particular about my face. Always checking for… imperfections. This is… a little strange. But alright, go ahead. A quick look. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will be very gentle. And I understand this may be a little uncomfortable, given your memories. We'll take our time. If you could just sit back and relax, and I’ll examine your face and neck. I'll be looking for any unusual moles, changes in skin texture, or areas of concern. I will verbalize my findings as I go, so you know what I'm looking at. Alright, I'm just going to start here on your forehead. I see some normal skin texture here. A few fine lines, which is very common. No immediate concerns here. Now, let's move to your cheeks…
PATIENT: Alright… cheeks. Be careful of the wrinkles, Doctor. My wife… she always used a special cream. Said it kept them away. Don't press too hard. It's… sensitive. And… you're sure you don't see anything bad? You're very quiet. Makes me nervous. I prefer when people talk. My wife… she was always talking. Even when I was trying to sleep. It was… comforting. But… go ahead. Just… be gentle. And tell me if you see anything. Even if it's just a small wrinkle. I like to know. It was always about the details, you see. Always the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, just gently feeling your cheeks now. I do notice some mild dryness, which is not uncommon, especially with exposure to air conditioning. And I’m noticing some very small, flat, red spots – these are called petechiae. They’re often harmless and can be caused by a number of things, but I'll make a note of them. No concerning masses or growths here. I’m just moving down to your nose now… Do you use any specific creams or lotions on your face regularly?
PATIENT: Creams and lotions… hmm. Not really. Just whatever my wife bought. She liked to try new things. Always searching for the best… something. Said it kept me looking young. But I didn't really pay attention. Just put it on when she told me to. Sometimes it smelled nice. Like flowers. Or… something expensive. But no… I don’t use anything special myself. And she… she picked everything. Said I didn't know what was good for my skin. Maybe… maybe that’s why it feels dry now. She's… gone. A long time ago. It’s hard to remember what she used. But… it smelled nice. Always smelled nice. You're making me think about her now. It’s… uncomfortable. Do you see anything bad on my nose, Doctor? Please tell me. I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It’s completely natural to have these memories come up. And it’s alright to feel uncomfortable. We can take a break if you'd like. Just looking at your nose now, I see some very small, visible blood vessels – these are called telangiectasias. They’re very common, especially as we age, and they’re often not a cause for concern. They can sometimes be treated cosmetically if they bother you, but they aren’t harmful. No concerning lesions or growths here. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your neck…
PATIENT: Neck… alright. Be careful of the wrinkles there too, Doctor. My wife… she always said my neck gave away my age. Always fussing… She was a good woman. A very good woman. But… she worried too much. About everything. Especially me. Said I didn’t take care of myself. But I worked hard. Very hard. To provide for us. But… yes. Look at my neck. Just… be gentle. And tell me if you see anything bad. I want to know. Even if it’s just a small wrinkle. It's the details that matter, you see. Always the details. And… please, Doctor… just be gentle. This is… hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Just gently feeling your neck now. I’m noticing some mild skin laxity, which is very common as we age – the skin naturally loses elasticity over time. And I’m seeing some age spots – these are small, flat, darkened areas of skin that are caused by sun exposure. They’re harmless, but they can be treated cosmetically if you’d like. I’m not seeing any concerning masses or lesions here. Your lymph nodes feel normal – not enlarged or tender. Okay, I’ve finished the examination of your face and neck. Overall, everything looks pretty good. I noticed some normal age-related changes – some mild dryness, skin laxity, age spots, and some small blood vessels – but nothing that is immediately concerning. Do you have any specific concerns that you'd like to discuss, or is there anything else that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Nothing specific… just… the doctor back home said I should get checked. Something about my face. And the lights. And the powders. I work with the theater, you see. Lots of bright lights. And lots of makeup. He was always fussing about something. But… you said everything looks good? Really good? No bad spots? No… cancers? My wife… she was always worried about that. Said I spent too much time under the lights. She… she would have wanted me to make sure. So… are you sure, Doctor? Really sure? It's hard to remember what he said. He just wanted me to get checked. That’s all. Just… get checked.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd. Based on my examination today, everything looks good. I don’t see any signs of cancer or anything immediately concerning. I understand your concerns about the lights and powders from the theater, and that's a valid point. Prolonged exposure can increase your risk of certain skin conditions. However, right now, your skin looks healthy. I do recommend ongoing monitoring and regular skin exams, just as your previous doctor suggested. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to re-evaluate. To be extra cautious, I could also order a biopsy of a couple of the age spots, just to rule everything out completely. It’s a simple procedure, and it would give you peace of mind. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? What’s that involve? Does it hurt? I don’t like pain. My wife… she hated when I got sick. Said I worried her too much. She… she would always take care of me. But… if it gives me peace of mind… and she would have wanted me to… alright. A biopsy. But just… just a couple of spots, alright? Not too many. And… will it leave a scar? I don’t want a big scar. People will notice. And… will it hurt? Please tell me it won't hurt too much. I’m a little nervous, Doctor. A little very nervous. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly natural to feel that way. A biopsy is a very simple procedure. We take a small sample of skin – just a tiny piece – and send it to a lab for analysis. It involves numbing the area with a local anesthetic – a small injection, like what the dentist uses – so you won’t feel any pain during the procedure. You might feel a slight pinch with the injection, and then some mild pressure when we take the sample. It usually takes just a few minutes. As for scarring, it’s usually very minimal. We use a small instrument, and we take great care to minimize any visible marks. It’s usually just a small, flat, slightly discolored spot that fades over time. We can also discuss options to help minimize scarring if you’re concerned. We'll just take a sample from a couple of the age spots. Is there anything else I can explain to you about the procedure?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. A little pinch… and a tiny bit of skin taken. And a small scar. Alright. But… who will do it? You, Doctor? I… I don’t want a student doing it. I want someone experienced. And… will it bleed? I don’t like blood. My wife… she fainted once when I cut myself shaving. Said she couldn't handle it. So… will it bleed a lot? And… how long will it take? I have… things to do. Important things. I can’t be here all day. Just… a little pinch. And a small scar. And no blood, alright? Please, Doctor. No blood. And someone experienced. Not a student. That’s all I ask. Just… experienced.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I will personally perform the biopsy myself. You have every right to feel comfortable with who is treating you, and I completely understand your preference. I have a great deal of experience with these procedures, so you can rest assured you’re in good hands. As for bleeding, it’s usually very minimal. We use a small instrument and apply pressure afterward to stop any bleeding. It’s typically just a few drops, and it stops very quickly. We’ll provide you with a bandage to keep the area clean and protected. It shouldn’t take long at all – just a few minutes for the procedure itself, and then a few minutes for aftercare instructions. We can get you scheduled for the biopsy today, if you’d like. We’ll just need a few minutes to prepare the area and then we can proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… today. If you insist. And you promise you’ll do it? Not a student? And no blood? Just a few drops? I… I can handle a few drops. But no more. My wife… she hated blood. It upset her too much. But… alright. Today. Just… get it over with quickly. And you promise it won't hurt too much? And a small scar? Very small? I… I need to look presentable. I have… things to do. Important things. So… today. Just… get it over with. Quickly. And gently. Please, Doctor. Gently.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I promise I will perform the biopsy myself. No students will be involved. And I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns, and I will take every precaution to minimize any discomfort and ensure a quick and smooth procedure. Let’s go ahead and get you prepared. We’ll go to the examination room, and I’ll clean the area and numb it before taking the sample. It shouldn’t take long at all. If you’re feeling anxious at any point, please don’t hesitate to tell me. We can take a break if you need one. Just let me know. We’ll get this taken care of quickly and efficiently, and then you can get back to your important things.
PATIENT: Alright… quickly. That’s all I ask. Quickly and gently. And… please, Doctor. No surprises. I don’t like surprises. Just… get it over with. And… please be careful. My wife… she would have wanted me to be careful. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. No surprises. I will explain every step of the procedure before I do it, and I will be as careful as possible. Alright, I’m just cleaning the area now. This might feel a little cool. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Once this is clean, I’m going to inject a small amount of local anesthetic. This will numb the area so you won’t feel any pain during the biopsy. It might feel like a tiny pinch, but it should go away quickly. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A tiny pinch… alright. But… don’t poke too much. And… be quick. I don’t like needles. My wife… she used to faint at the sight of them. Just… a tiny pinch. And be quick. Please, Doctor. Be quick. And… will it hurt afterward? Will it be sore? I… I have things to do. Important things. Just… a tiny pinch. And be quick. Don’t poke too much. And… no surprises. Please. No surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. Just a tiny pinch, and I will be as quick as possible. I promise not to poke too much. I understand your concerns about needles, and I will be very gentle. Alright, just a tiny pinch now. This might feel a little bit of pressure, but it should go away quickly. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. We want to make sure this is as comfortable as possible for you. It usually takes a minute or two for the anesthetic to fully numb the area. We’ll wait until it’s completely numb before we proceed. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, just feeling the area now. Can you feel anything?
PATIENT: A little… a little pressure. Not too bad. Just… a little pressure. But… it’s starting to feel numb. Yes… starting to feel numb. But… it tingles. It still tingles. And… will it look bad afterward? Will people notice? I have… important appointments. And I need to look presentable. Just… tingling. And… starting to feel numb. But… will people notice? Please, Doctor. Will people notice?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. That tingling is perfectly normal – it just means the anesthetic is working. It should subside in a few minutes. And don't worry about it looking bad afterward. The biopsy sites will be very small, and we’ll apply a bandage to cover them. They’ll likely be a little red and slightly tender for a few days, but they should heal quickly. We can also recommend some camouflage makeup to help minimize any visible redness if you’re concerned. Okay, I'm just going to proceed with the biopsy now. It will be very quick – just a tiny pinch, and then it will be done. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Tiny pinch… alright. But… be quick. Very, very quick. And… gentle. Please, Doctor. Gentle. And… no surprises. No surprises, alright? Just… a tiny pinch. And… gentle. And quick. And… no surprises. Do it now… Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. That’s the first one done. Just a tiny pinch, as promised. And now, just the second one. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. That’s the second one done. All finished. There you go. All done. Just a tiny bit of pressure for a few minutes, and then we’ll put some bandages on them. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Done…? Is it really done? It… didn't hurt too bad. Just… a little pinch. But… is it bleeding? Is it going to bleed a lot? It feels… strange. But… not too bad. Really? All done? And… it won’t look bad, will it? Please tell me it won’t look bad. I have… important appointments. And I need to look presentable. Just… not too bad. And not too noticeable. Please, Doctor. Tell me it won’t look too bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, it's really all done. And you’re right, it didn’t hurt too bad – just a little pinch, as promised. And you’re right to be concerned about bleeding – but there’s very little bleeding now. These bandages will help keep everything clean and protected. As for how it looks – it’s perfectly normal for them to be a little red and slightly tender for a few days. But they’re very small – just tiny little dots. We can apply some camouflage makeup to help minimize any visible redness if you’d like. It will just blend right in. You’ll barely notice them. I’m confident you’ll be perfectly presentable for your important appointments. Just keep the area clean and dry, and we’ll provide you with some aftercare instructions to help them heal quickly. Are you feeling okay now?
PATIENT: Camouflage makeup…? Alright. That sounds… good. Yes. Camouflage makeup. That will help. Barely noticeable… you said? Just… tiny little dots? That’s… reassuring. And… it won’t get infected, will it? My wife… she worried about infections. Everything had to be sterilized. Everything. And… how long until they heal? And… will they scar? Please, Doctor. Tell me they won’t scar. I have… important meetings. And I need to look presentable. Just… no scars. And… no infection. Please, Doctor. No scars. No infection. Just… tiny little dots. Is that right? Tiny little dots?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, just tiny little dots. That’s right. And we’ll do everything we can to prevent infection. We’ll provide you with some antibacterial ointment to apply to the area, and we’ll give you instructions on how to keep it clean and protected. We'll also send you home with some written aftercare instructions. As for scarring, it’s very unlikely you’ll have any noticeable scars. We use a small instrument, and we take great care to minimize any damage to the skin. Most people don’t even notice them after they heal. If you're concerned, we can also recommend some scar cream to help minimize any potential discoloration. They should heal within a week or two, and the redness will gradually fade over time. You'll be perfectly presentable for your important meetings. We’ll also send the samples to the lab for analysis, and we’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Camouflage makeup… antibacterial ointment… no scars… and tiny little dots. Yes. That’s… reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. You were… very gentle. And you explained everything. My wife… she would have been pleased. Just… tell me… is it really all over? No surprises, right? No hidden problems? Just… tiny little dots? And… I can go now? I have… important appointments.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd. It's really all over. You were very brave, and you handled everything wonderfully. And you're very welcome. And no, no hidden problems. Just tiny little dots that will heal quickly with proper care. Yes, you can absolutely go now. Just take it easy, follow the aftercare instructions, and don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. And please, don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment to check on your progress. Have a wonderful day, and good luck with your important appointments.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… thank you again.
