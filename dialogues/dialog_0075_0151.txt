DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's August 2nd, and I see here you're 63 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Teretha Uzarski. Sixty-three, that’s right. Well, it’s my hands and feet… they’ve been tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It’s been going on for a little bit now, and I thought I should probably get it checked out. I just want to get to the bottom of it, if you don’t mind. I got mail to deliver, after all!
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Tingling in the hands and feet… that can be caused by a number of things. “Pins and needles,” as you say, is a good way to describe it. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe a month or so? It comes and goes, really. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, it’s a bit more bothersome. Especially when I'm sorting the mail. Lots of little movements with the hands, you see. It’s not constant, thankfully. But it’s enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: A month, coming and going… and worse with fine motor movements. Alright. And is it just the tingling, or do you experience any pain, weakness, or numbness along with it?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain, not really. Not a sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes a little ache, but it’s not bad. Weakness… no, I don’t think so. I can still grip things and walk just fine. Numbness… occasionally, yes. Maybe a little bit of numbness in my fingertips, but it doesn’t last long. It’s mostly just the tingling, to be honest. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. Unsettling is a good word for it. Okay. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I try to stay active, walking my route and all. I eat… reasonably. Not a fancy diet, mostly just what’s easy. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. I’m not one for complaining, you see. And my husband… he always took care of things like that. He passed away a few years back, and… well, I just haven't gotten around to it, really. I don't have insurance, either, so… it’s complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s perfectly alright that you haven’t prioritized doctor’s visits. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I know of! Nothing major, anyway. I had a bad flu once, a long time ago, but that’s about it. No diabetes, no heart problems… the doctors always said I had a strong constitution. My mother always said it was from all the hard work on the farm when I was a girl. Honestly, I’m usually pretty healthy. That’s why this tingling is so strange.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And I’ve only been in the hospital once, when I was a little girl and broke my arm falling out of a tree. It healed up just fine. My mother was not pleased about that, let me tell you. But honestly, that’s it. Nothing else. I’m a pretty simple case, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. My mother’s side… they had a lot of… aches and pains, mostly. Arthritis, I think. And my father’s side… well, he didn’t talk much about his family. From what I remember, they all lived pretty long lives. Lots of farmers and laborers. No one talked about any serious illnesses, really. It wasn’t something we discussed much. Maybe heart problems, on my father's side? But I'm not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… coffee, in the morning. To get me going, you know? I don’t take any pills or anything like that. I try to avoid them if I can. Always preferred natural remedies, if possible, but honestly, I haven’t found anything that helps with this tingling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a problem with pollen or dust or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I think. Mostly, I just try to stay away from trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright. I'll need to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a lot of mail to deliver, you see. But do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. First, could you please extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Like this? Is that good? They might be a little shaky, I've been sorting a lot of letters today.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, I’m going to gently touch different parts of your hands and arms with this, and you tell me when you feel it. Just say "yes" when you feel the sensation. Starting here… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It’s… a little bit ticklish, maybe? But yes, I feel it. Is something wrong? It’s just, sometimes my fingers are a little numb, you know. Like I said before.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now your feet. Please relax your legs. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. That's… a little colder. My feet get cold easily, you know? Especially in the winter. But yes, I feel it. Is that normal? That tingling is still there, just a little bit. It’s hard to describe. It's like… pins and needles, but not painful. Just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. The sensation is slightly reduced in your hands and feet, which is consistent with what you’ve described. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing this without further testing. However, based on your symptoms and the examination, a few possibilities come to mind. One is peripheral neuropathy – that's damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It can be caused by a variety of things, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, or even just age. Another possibility is compression of the nerves, like carpal tunnel syndrome in your hands. We should run some tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be willing to have some blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh dear. I don't really like needles, Doctor. And… well, I don’t have insurance, you know? Is it expensive? I just… I worry about the cost of things. But if you think it's important, I suppose I can manage. Just tell me how much it will be, and we'll see. It’s just… it’s complicated. But if it helps figure out what's wrong with my hands, I’ll do it. I need to deliver the mail, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Uzarski. I wouldn't recommend it if I didn't think it was important. The blood work will help us rule out some of the more common causes of neuropathy, like vitamin deficiencies or diabetes. We can work with the lab to see if they offer a discounted rate for uninsured patients, and I can also see if there are any local programs that might be able to help with the cost. It will likely be around $150-$200, but we can confirm with the lab. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a vitamin B12 supplement. It's relatively inexpensive and can sometimes help with nerve function. And I want you to keep a log of your symptoms – when they occur, how severe they are, and anything that seems to make them better or worse. We can review it at your next appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A vitamin supplement… yes, that sounds manageable. And keeping a log… alright, I can do that. I have a little notebook I use for my grocery list, I can use that. $200… that's a bit much, but… alright. If it helps. And you’ll help me look for discounts? That would be very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. When should I start the supplement? And what kind should I get? I don't want to buy the wrong thing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I'm happy to help in any way I can. You can start the vitamin B12 supplement right away. Look for a sublingual form – that means it dissolves under your tongue. Those are generally absorbed better. A dose of 1000 micrograms daily is a good starting point. You can find them at most pharmacies or grocery stores. Here, I've written it down for you. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to review your symptom log and the blood work results. If your symptoms worsen significantly before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, that’s very helpful. Sublingual… I’ll remember that. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate you looking into the discount for the blood work. I really do need to get back to my route, though. Lots of letters to deliver! Thank you again for everything. I hope we can figure out what’s wrong with my hands. I just want to keep doing my job. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I understand. We'll do our best. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll take it one step at a time. Have a good day, and be careful out there delivering the mail. .
