DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot... it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A very painful sore. It won’t heal. It’s on my foot, near my toes. It’s been like this for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been painful and isn’t healing. I see. And when you say “a little while,” could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe… six weeks? Six weeks, give or take. It started small, just a little red spot, and then it got bigger and… worse. It hurts to walk, even with shoes. I try to stay off it, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, alright. And you said it started as a small red spot. Do you remember anything that might have caused it?
PATIENT: No, no I don't think so. I don't remember hurting my foot, or anything like that. I just noticed it one day after my shower. Maybe a little bug bite? But it just… stayed. And got worse, like I said. I don't know. Old age, maybe? It happens, you know.
DOCTOR: It certainly can happen with age, Mr. Stoegbauer. We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, has anything made it better at all?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I try to keep it clean, with soap and water. And I put a bandage on it, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It just keeps getting redder, and more painful. Sometimes it feels warm too. It’s a real bother, Doctor. A real bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, keeping it clean and bandaged is good. And you mentioned it feels warm sometimes – that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this sore?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm… well, I get thirsty a lot. More thirsty than usual, maybe. And I have to… go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Is that… is that something to do with the foot? I’m not sure. I just thought… well, old age again, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and frequent urination. Those could be related, yes, or they could be something separate. It’s good you mentioned them. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor… my last doctor, before he retired… he told me I had… … sugar. Too much sugar in my blood, he said. He called it… diabetes, I think. He gave me some pills, to take every day. I still take them. I think. Yes, I still take them.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes. And you’re still taking your medication for it, that's good. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: No, no I don't. It’s a little white pill. I take one every morning, with my breakfast. I don’t remember the name, sorry. Too many pills these days, you know. It all gets mixed up. Old age… again.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little white pill each morning. That's alright, we can look that up later. Now, are you allergic to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I used to eat anything, when I was younger. But now… I try to be careful. But no, no allergies. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you. Now, let’s take a look at the foot itself. Could you please remove your shoe and sock, if you’re comfortable doing so?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. It’s not a pretty sight, I’m afraid. Be careful, it’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the ulcer, and it does appear somewhat inflamed. There is some redness around the edges, and it is warm to the touch. Your pulses feel a little weak, but present. It’s important to monitor this closely, as ulcers in individuals with diabetes can be slow to heal and prone to infection. I'm also noting some dryness and cracking of the skin on your foot. Would you mind if I take a quick blood sugar reading now, just to see where things are at?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Anything you think is best, Doctor. Slow to heal… that’s what my wife used to say. She always worried about my feet. Go ahead with the reading, please. I just want it to get better, you know? So I can walk again.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood sugar is currently reading at 210. That’s higher than the target range. It explains the slow healing and increased risk of infection. We need to get this better controlled. Now, would you be able to tell me about any medications you are taking currently, besides the white pill for diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Besides the little white pill… I take something for my blood pressure. A little pink pill. The doctor… the last doctor, he gave it to me. It's for my heart, he said. Something about it being too fast sometimes. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my knees. When they hurt really bad. A yellow capsule. But not every day, only when I need to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Stoegbauer. A pink pill for blood pressure and a yellow capsule for your knees when needed. That's very helpful. Do you happen to know the names of these medications?
PATIENT: No, no I don’t. I have so many pills! My daughter used to keep track, but she moved away. I just ask the pharmacist if it’s the right one, when I get them refilled. I’m sorry I can’t be more help. It’s hard to remember everything these days. Old age… again.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, don't worry about it. It’s perfectly understandable. We can look up your medications at the pharmacy later. Now, to get a better understanding of the situation, have you had any recent falls or injuries?
PATIENT: No, no falls. Not recently. Maybe a little stumble now and then, but nothing serious. I’m careful, you know. I try to be. I don't want to break anything. My bones aren't what they used to be. No, no falls. Just a little unsteady sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent falls, just a little unsteady at times. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it... My feet feel a little… sleepy sometimes. Especially at night. Like they’re not really there. And sometimes… a little pins and needles. Not all the time, but it happens. It’s worse when I sit for too long. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Numbness and tingling, especially with prolonged sitting, could indicate some nerve involvement. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, we have a good starting point. Based on what you've told me, and my examination, it appears you have a diabetic foot ulcer complicated by possible neuropathy and suboptimal blood sugar control. We need to address all of these issues to prevent further complications, such as infection or amputation. First, we need to get your blood sugar under better control. I recommend a consultation with an endocrinologist. They can adjust your diabetes medication and provide education on diet and exercise. Secondly, we need to keep this ulcer clean and protected to prevent infection. I will prescribe a special dressing. Finally, we need to assess the blood flow in your legs to ensure there are no underlying vascular issues. I would like to order a vascular ultrasound. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot. An… an endocrinologist? And… a vascular… what did you call it? A vascular ultrasound? It sounds… serious. I just want my foot to get better. Will it… will it hurt? And will it take a long time? I’m an old man, Doctor. I don't have a lot of time left. But… yes. Yes, do what you think is best. If it will help my foot, I’ll do it. Just… please explain everything clearly. And try not to make it too complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. It does sound like a lot, but it’s important to address all these issues to give you the best chance of healing. An endocrinologist is a specialist who treats hormone-related conditions, like diabetes. They can fine-tune your medication to get your blood sugar in a better range. A vascular ultrasound is a painless test that uses sound waves to check the blood flow in your legs. It helps us make sure there aren’t any blockages preventing proper healing. The goal is not to overwhelm you, but to get your foot healthy and prevent any serious complications. We will take things one step at a time. I will prescribe the special dressing for the ulcer today. I will also give you a referral to an endocrinologist and a requisition for the vascular ultrasound. The ultrasound can be scheduled at your convenience. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. I will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for your foot at home. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: A special dressing… and instructions for home… Yes, that sounds good. The endocrinologist… will they be able to see me quickly? I don't want to wait too long. And… will the ultrasound be… expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. I don’t have a lot of extra money. And… … will it hurt? I know I keep asking about that. It’s just… I don't want any more pain.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Mr. Stoegbauer, and I'm glad you asked them. I'll write a note for the endocrinologist requesting a prompt appointment, emphasizing your concern about getting your blood sugar under control. Generally, they can see new patients within a few weeks. I'll also have my staff check with the ultrasound facility regarding your insurance coverage and potential costs. They often have financial assistance programs available, and we can explore those options if needed. Regarding pain, the vascular ultrasound itself is completely painless. It's just like getting an image of a baby during pregnancy. The dressing I prescribe is designed to protect the ulcer and promote healing. It may require some initial adjustment, but we will provide you with clear instructions to minimize any discomfort. We'll also discuss pain management options if the ulcer is particularly painful. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to keep you comfortable throughout this process. Is there anything else on your mind right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate that. It makes me feel… better, knowing what to expect. The dressing… and the appointment with the endocrinologist… and the ultrasound… Yes. That sounds good. Just… please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I hope it all works out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. My staff will contact you to schedule the endocrinologist appointment and the vascular ultrasound. They will also provide you with detailed instructions regarding preparation for each test. For the ultrasound, you’ll likely need to avoid eating or drinking anything for a few hours beforehand. We'll make sure you have all the information you need. In the meantime, please keep the ulcer clean and protected with a bandage. Try to avoid putting too much weight on your foot, and elevate it whenever possible. Here's the prescription for the special dressing. And I'll have my staff print out some information about diabetic foot care for you to take home. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and I’ll see you again in two weeks to review the results of the tests and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Do you have any final questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m good. Two weeks… yes. That sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your help. I really do. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We'll see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
