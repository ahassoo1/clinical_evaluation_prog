DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it, alright? It’s this tiredness. Just… constantly tired. And it’s gotten worse lately. And… well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot of it, but… yeah. Dirt. I don’t know why I’m doing it, and it’s not like I enjoy it, if you can believe that. It just… feels like I need it.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say. Right. And this tiredness… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, I suppose. Maybe even longer? It’s hard to say exactly. Things just… gradually get worse, you know? It's not like one day I woke up and suddenly felt awful. Just… a slow decline. And the dirt… that’s only been a recent thing, maybe the last month or so. Honestly, I thought it was just a phase, but it’s not going away, and I’m starting to feel ridiculous.
DOCTOR: A gradual decline… and the dirt craving is recent. Okay. Can you describe this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just sleepy, you know? It’s… everything feels heavy. Like wading through mud. I don’t have the energy to do anything. Even getting out of bed is a struggle some days. And I used to be so active! Gardening, walking… Now? Forget about it. And it's not like I’m not sleeping enough. I get my eight hours, easy. It just… doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Eight hours of sleep, but still fatigued. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been a bit more… short-tempered, I suppose. Snappish with the folks at the grocery store. Not proud of that. And my appetite’s been… off. Sometimes I don’t feel hungry at all. Other times I just want… well, not necessarily dirt, but… things I shouldn't be eating. Like chalk, once. It was a small piece. Don't look at me like that! It just felt… appealing.
DOCTOR: Chalk, as well. Ms. Hardenburgh, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Goodness, now you’re asking about… that? Look, I’m not going to sit here and discuss my… personal business. Is this really necessary? I came in here because I’m tired and I’m eating dirt, not because I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom! If it was that serious, I would have said something. Honestly, this is a bit much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your discomfort, but these questions are pertinent. The craving for non-food items – what we call pica – can be indicative of several underlying medical conditions, often involving nutritional deficiencies. It’s vital to rule those out. Now, can you please tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you’re using fancy words. Look, fine. It’s… darker. A little darker than usual. And… harder. More difficult to, you know. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I don't spend my days examining my stool, so I'm not going to be very precise. I just know it’s not… normal. And frankly, I find this whole line of questioning a bit insulting. I’m a grown woman!
DOCTOR: Darker stools and constipation. Alright. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! Goodness gracious, no! If I’d seen blood, do you think I’d be sitting here calmly discussing it with you? I’d be at the emergency room! Honestly, you’re starting to scare me with these questions. I came in here tired and eating dirt, and now you're asking about blood? This is ridiculous! I think I’m done. I’ll just go home and… I don’t know. Stop eating dirt, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration, but dismissing this as nothing won't help. The combination of fatigue, pica, and changes in bowel habits requires investigation. I’m going to need to run some blood tests to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney function. We should also perform a stool sample to rule out any underlying infections or bleeding. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Honestly. Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Just… don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. And how long is this going to take? I have things to do, you know. I'm not going to spend all day sitting in a waiting room.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need a blood sample and a stool sample. The blood work usually takes a few hours, and the stool sample may take a couple of days for results. The nurse will explain the collection process. While we wait for the results, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Honestly, nothing. Absolutely nothing. I don't believe in all those pills the doctors push on people. I try to take care of myself naturally. A good night’s sleep, a healthy diet… well, except for the dirt, of course. But that's a recent thing! I don’t take any medications. Not even aspirin.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. I eat everything. Well, except for maybe those weird processed things they call food these days, but that's a matter of taste, not allergies. Honestly, I'm a pretty robust person. I've never had much trouble with… anything, really. Except for this tiredness and, well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears. And I'd like to check your abdomen as well. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke at me? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Fine. Just… be quick about it. And don’t expect me to be comfortable. I don’t like being touched.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the lower right quadrant. It's mild, but worth noting. I don't feel any masses. Your pulse is a little slow, and your blood pressure is slightly low. Okay. Please sit up now. We'll wait for the lab results, and then we can discuss the next steps. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review everything.
PATIENT: Next week?! Look, I don’t want to come back next week! I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself. Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'm tired and I eat a little dirt, and now I need blood tests, follow-up appointments… It's absurd. I just want to know when I can get these tests done and be on my way. I have a garden to tend, you know.
DOCTOR: The lab can take you right away. I've already sent the requisition. I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, but ignoring these symptoms won't make them disappear. While we wait for the results, I want to stress the importance of hydration. Drink plenty of fluids. And, if possible, try to avoid eating dirt. Here’s the lab slip, and a reminder for your follow-up appointment. It’s best to have a plan and address this, rather than simply hoping it resolves on its own. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. Honestly. Just… don’t expect me to be thrilled about coming back. And please, no more questions about my… personal habits. I’ll just… go do the tests. And try to drink more water, alright? Happy now? .
