DOCTOR: Right. Mande Haggart, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mande Haggar. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Havird, is it? I hope you don’t mind me asking, but it’s a lovely name.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. Though I doubt names are your primary concern at the moment. So, let’s get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, actually. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve been looking a little yellow, my daughter noticed. But it only seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s… odd. I didn't think fava beans could do that.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I know it sounds silly, but every time I have them – even just a few – I get really weak and my skin gets this… yellowish tinge. It started a few months ago, and it’s getting worse. I thought maybe it was just a weird allergy at first, but it feels different than allergies I’ve had before.
DOCTOR: Yellowing of the skin… after consuming fava beans. Hmm. And you’ve noticed this consistently?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. I even tried it a couple of times to be sure – which I know wasn’t the smartest thing, but I wanted to rule out coincidence. Each time, within a few hours, I start to feel really drained, and my eyes and skin get noticeably yellow. It goes away after a few days, but it's quite worrying. My daughter insisted I come see someone.
DOCTOR: Right. And are there any other symptoms that accompany this… reaction?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been feeling a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m tired. And I’ve noticed my urine is… darker than usual. Almost like tea. It's hard to explain, but everything just feels… off when it happens. Not like being sick with a cold or the flu, more like my body is just… working too hard.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, shortness of breath… these are not things to be ignored, regardless of the… bean-related component. Have you had any fever, abdominal pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. And no abdominal pain, no. I haven’t been sick at all, really. No nausea or vomiting, either. Just… the tiredness, the yellow skin, the dark urine, and feeling a bit breathless. It's just… so strange that it's linked to fava beans! I feel like you probably think I'm making this up.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I don’t concern myself with whether a patient feels they are making something up. However, this presentation is… unusual. Let's run some basic blood tests, check your liver function and a complete blood count. That’ll give us a better starting point. We should also check your reticulocyte count.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to figure out what’s going on. “Reticulo-what” was it? I’m terrible with medical terms. And where will the blood be taken?
DOCTOR: Reticulocytes. Red blood cells. It’s a measure of how quickly your body is making new blood cells. Don't worry about the details. The phlebotomist will take a sample from your arm. It's a standard procedure. Should be quick enough. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't had any serious allergic reactions in the past. I’m a little sensitive to penicillin, but that's just a mild rash, nothing life-threatening. And no latex allergy that I know of. I've had vaccinations, but I don’t remember specific details. Is that okay? Should I be able to list them?
DOCTOR: No, it’s… adequate. Knowing what you aren’t allergic to is often more useful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Just a pain reliever occasionally for a headache, but that's it. Nothing prescribed, just… ibuprofen sometimes. And I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a few months ago. So, no, nothing consistent. Just the occasional ibuprofen. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is fine. It’s the occasional use that matters little. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart problems later in life. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. My grandparents… I don’t really know much about their medical history, unfortunately. They passed away a long time ago. Does high blood pressure and heart problems matter? It’s not a particularly interesting family history, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: It's useful to know. We’ll send you to the lab for those tests, then. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, avoid fava beans. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms - severe shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain - go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No more fava beans, and if anything gets worse, go to the emergency room. I can definitely do that. Thank you, Doctor Havird. So, do I just go to the lab now? Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? And… about those tests, could you maybe explain a little bit about what you’re looking for? Just so I have some idea?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, desk three. They’ll need my order. As for explaining the tests… Look, I don’t have time to give a full medical lecture to every patient. Essentially, we’re looking to see if your liver is functioning properly and assessing your red blood cell count. A deficiency in a certain enzyme can cause these symptoms after ingesting… certain foods. It's… complex. Let’s just get the tests done first, then we’ll discuss the results. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. No need to explain everything now. Just the tests. Down the hall, desk three. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I'll go do that right away. And… I appreciate you seeing me. .
