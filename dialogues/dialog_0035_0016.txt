DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… something about the bruising, really. I mean, I know these things happen when you're on the blood thinner, but it just seems… more than usual lately. And frankly, I’ve been through enough with this medicine already. It's just inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising that seems worse than expected with the blood thinner is definitely something we need to look into. Just to clarify, when you say "lately," about how long has this increased bruising been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It's… hard to say exactly. Probably the last month or so? It feels like it's been creeping up on me. It’s not like one specific bump, it's just... more easily. I knock into things normally, you know, and it used to just be a little color. Now it's… well, it’s a mess. Honestly, my housekeeper keeps giving me worried looks. She's very observant, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of gradually worsening bruising. And it’s happening with typical, everyday bumps. That’s good to know. Do you remember any specific event that seemed to trigger this, or did it just start happening slowly?
PATIENT: No, no specific thing. That’s what’s so frustrating! It didn’t come after a fall or anything like that. I haven’t changed anything in my routine. Same diet, same everything. It just... started. Which, if you ask me, is the most annoying kind of problem there is. You can't fix something if you don't know why it's happening. It's just… illogical.
DOCTOR: I agree, that is frustrating. It’s much easier when there’s a clear cause. Okay, so no changes in your routine, diet, or medications?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. And don't tell me to change my diet. I eat perfectly well. Mostly. I’m a reasonably healthy man for my age, you know. And the medicine… well, I take what they tell me. I'm not one to question doctors, usually, but this… this is just ridiculous. I’ve been on this stuff for years, and never had this problem before. It's probably just a bad batch or something. They don't make things like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Besides the increased bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I haven’t felt any different, if that makes sense. No dizziness, no fatigue, no… bleeding gums or anything like that. Just the bruising. It's… unsightly, naturally. My daughter keeps telling me I should be more careful, but really, it's not my fault if everything seems to be made of glass these days. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms accompanying the bruising. That’s helpful. Now, let’s go over your medical history briefly, just to make sure I have everything correct. I see you’ve been on a blood thinner for several years – can you tell me what condition it’s for?
PATIENT: Oh, it's the… the irregular heartbeat. Atrial fibrillation, I think they call it. It’s annoying, really. Just a little flutter now and then, but apparently, it's serious enough to need the medicine. Which, of course, then causes other problems. Honestly, it feels like one step forward and two steps back with all of this. I just wish they’d come up with a better solution. It's all very… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, atrial fibrillation, treated with a blood thinner. And you’ve been on it for several years. Do you remember the name of the blood thinner you're taking?
PATIENT: Ugh, names… they never stick with me. Let me see… I think it starts with a 'W'? Warfarin, maybe? Yes, that’s it. Warfarin. I’m reasonably sure. My wife used to manage all the medications, and now… well, it's just me trying to keep track of everything. It’s not easy, you know. Things were simpler before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin. That's good to know. And you said your wife used to manage your medications?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. She passed away a few years ago. She was very organized. Kept everything in order. I... I miss her a lot. She would have known all this off the top of her head. I’m just... not very good with details, I suppose. It's a burden, having to keep track of everything myself. Especially with all the worry about the dosage and… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s a lot to manage on your own, and losing your wife must make it even harder. We’ll get through this together. Let’s move on to some basic questions to rule out other potential causes. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or fevers?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Well, aside from the heart, of course. And now this bruising. But no colds, no flu, no… nothing. I haven't been anywhere exotic lately, if that's what you're thinking. Just puttering around the house, mostly. Honestly, the most excitement I've had recently was arguing with the gardener about the roses. He keeps pruning them too short, if you can believe it. A perfectly good rose bush, ruined.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent illnesses or infections. Let's talk about your other medications. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking any other prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. I think… lisinopril? Yes, that's it. Lisinopril. And… I take a multivitamin sometimes. But that's it, really. Nothing fancy. I'm not one for all those herbal remedies and… nonsense. My wife used to take a lot of supplements, but I never saw much point in them. Mostly just expensive urine, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a multivitamin occasionally. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be very careful about trying new things, but now… well, it’s just not worth the trouble, frankly. I stick to what I know. I’m a reasonably simple man with reasonably simple tastes. No exotic foods, no strange pills, nothing like that. I’ve always believed in moderation, you see. And avoiding unnecessary risks.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Farson, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just so I can get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Get on with it. I haven't got all day, you know. Although, admittedly, I don't have much planned. Still. It's best to be efficient. And I'd like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The bruising is becoming rather… noticeable, you understand. I don't want my daughter fussing over me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the areas where you’ve been experiencing the bruising. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80. Hmm. I see some significant bruising on your forearms and legs. The bruises vary in size and color, some are newer, some look older. No signs of swelling or tenderness. No evidence of any other skin changes. Capillary refill is normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Peripheral pulses are present and strong. Okay, everything seems normal so far, aside from the bruising itself. I'm going to order a blood test to check your Warfarin levels, your complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us determine if your Warfarin dosage is correct, if you have any signs of anemia or other underlying conditions that could be contributing to the bruising.
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Whatever it takes. As long as it gets me an answer. Honestly, I’m starting to suspect the medicine itself is the problem. A bad batch, I tell you. They just don't make things like they used to. And don't tell me it's my diet. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment? I haven't got a lot of free time, you know.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. We can discuss them over the phone, or you can schedule a brief follow-up appointment, whichever is more convenient for you. I'd like to see you back in a week regardless, even if the results are normal, just to monitor the bruising and make sure it's improving. We'll also discuss strategies to minimize future bruising. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as bleeding from the gums, nosebleeds, or blood in your urine or stool. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Bleeding from the gums… Honestly, the things you doctors worry about. Fine, a week. I suppose that’s alright. But if it’s nothing, I expect a quick phone call. And please, no lectures about my diet or lifestyle. I’m a reasonably careful man. As for questions… no, I suppose not. Just fix the problem, Doctor. That’s all I ask. And try to get a better quality of medicine. That’s my only request. Honestly, it's a disgrace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and find a solution. I'll make a note to discuss the potential medicine quality with the pharmacy. Here's a lab requisition form. Please take it to the lab at your earliest convenience. And here’s my card with the clinic number if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for your patience, and we'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
