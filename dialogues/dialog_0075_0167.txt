DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. My foot... it hurts very much. I have a sore that won't go away. It's on my foot, and it's causing me trouble walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing and causing you trouble walking. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It started… maybe a few months ago? Small at first. I thought it was just a scrape, you know? But it got bigger. And now… it’s red and… sometimes it feels warm. It hurts when I put weight on it. I try to wear soft shoes, but it doesn't always help. I have… what you call it… the sugar sickness. My wife, she used to take care of it, but she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's understandable that things are more difficult now. And thank you for telling me about the “sugar sickness” – that’s diabetes, and it’s important information. It can definitely affect how wounds heal. So, just to clarify, the sore has been there for a few months, started small, and has gotten bigger and more painful over time. It’s red and warm to the touch. You said it hurts when you put weight on it. Is there any discharge or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Discharge… pus? Hmm… sometimes, yes. A little bit. It is… yellowish, I think. Not a lot, but enough to make the bandage… not clean. I change the bandage every day, but it still happens. It doesn't smell, not that I notice. It just… is there. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge is good to know. It sounds like it could be infected, and that’s why it’s not healing. It's good you’re changing the bandage daily. Now, let me ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness… sometimes, yes. Not all the time. Mostly in my toes. It feels… like they are sleeping. Not always all of them, just a few. It is worse when I try to walk for too long. It's a strange feeling, Doctor. Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. That "sleeping" sensation is what we call neuropathy, and it’s also common with diabetes. It means the nerves in your feet are being affected. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot, if that’s alright. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Here you go. Be careful, it is a little tender.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I see the sore. It's located on the top of your foot, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. There is some redness and swelling around the edges, and it does appear infected. Your pulses are present, which is good, but they are a little weak. I also notice some calluses on the other parts of your foot. It is tender to the touch, as you mentioned. Based on what you've told me and what I see, this appears to be a diabetic foot ulcer. Because of the infection and the neuropathy, it’s important we address this quickly to prevent it from getting worse. I'm going to order some lab work to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. I also want to get an X-ray to make sure there's no bone involvement. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to get better. I do not want to lose my foot. I have heard stories… Lab work and an X-ray… yes, please. Whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, and you're right to be proactive. We will do everything we can to prevent any complications. Losing a limb is rare with proper care, and we're going to focus on getting this wound healed. Okay, I’m going to send you to the lab right down the hall for the blood work. Then, the technician will take an X-ray of your foot. After that, we’ll discuss the results and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, it’s very important that you avoid putting weight on this foot as much as possible. I’m going to have the nurse bring you a walking boot to help with this. Also, continue to change the bandage daily, keeping it clean and dry. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: A walking boot… that sounds good. I need to stay off it? Even just a little bit? And the bandage… yes, I can do that. No questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. You make me feel better. It is good to have someone taking care of this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. That’s my job. And yes, avoiding putting weight on the foot as much as possible is crucial, even just a little bit. It allows the wound to heal and prevents further infection. I'm going to have the nurse come in to get your vitals and then take you to the lab. After the X-ray, we’ll meet back here to discuss the results and create a plan. Please let the nurse know if you have any pain or discomfort while walking. We’ll take care of this together.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again. I will wait here. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will be right back after the nurse gets you settled. Don't hesitate to call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
