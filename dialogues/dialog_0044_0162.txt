DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for pleasantries. It's my stomach, alright? Been… puffy. Bloated. It's annoying, that’s what it is. Just want something to fix it and get on with my day.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you're short on time and just want to get this sorted. “Puffy and bloated” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, how much detail do you need? It just… swells up. After I eat, mostly. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Feels like I’ve swallowed a beach ball. And it's uncomfortable, obviously. Look, I drive a pile driver for a living, okay? I don’t sit around analyzing my digestion all day. Just fix it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand – you’ve got a demanding job and don't want this getting in the way. No need to analyze, just describe it as best you can. So, it swells up after eating, regardless of what you eat. About how long after eating does this start to happen?
PATIENT: Honestly? Can't say for sure. Sometime soon after, sometime later. I don't keep a log or anything. It just… happens. It’s not like it’s a precise science, Doc. And it'll go away eventually. Usually. I’m just… tired of feeling like this. It's been going on for...well, a while now. Months, I guess. Don't remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "a while now, months" – that’s helpful. And it does eventually go away on its own. Besides the bloating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? What kind of symptoms are we talking about? Pain? Sometimes. Gas, obviously. It comes with the… puffiness. Not like I’m doubled over or anything. Just… general discomfort. And, honestly, just feeling sluggish. Tired. Probably just the job, though. It’s hard work. I’m not complaining, just… stating facts.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain and gas alongside the bloating and feeling sluggish. That gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel... Look, are you going to ask me about everything? It’s… normal. Mostly. Sometimes a little… loose. Sometimes a little… hard. Does it really matter? I told you, I don’t spend my days cataloging my insides. Is this going to take all day? I’ve got a job to do. Pile driving doesn't do itself, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I'm not trying to be difficult. These details do help me figure out what's going on, and rule things out. "Sometimes loose, sometimes hard" – has there been any blood in your stool, or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, that’s… that’s a little much, Doc. I haven't seen any blood. No. And I don’t want to talk about this anymore. Honestly. Just… give me something for the bloating. Anything. I just need it to stop. I’m a practical man, I don't need a long explanation, I need a solution.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood. I appreciate you telling me that. It sounds like you’re experiencing fairly persistent bloating, some gas and discomfort, and changes in your bowel movements, and feeling tired. Before I suggest anything, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to lie here for an hour while you poke around. I have things to do. Pile driving, remember? It won’t do itself. And please, try to be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen in a few different spots, and then gently feel around. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Okay… I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. A little bit of tenderness when I press here, on your lower left side, but nothing alarming. Not a lot of distension, which is good. I don't feel any masses or anything like that. Let me just check your reflexes quickly... Everything seems normal there as well. Given what you’ve described, and what I’m hearing and feeling, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. However, to be sure, and to rule out anything else, I'd like to order a couple of simple blood tests, and a stool sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: IBS? Is that… serious? Look, I don’t do “syndromes.” I do physical labor. Pile driving. I need to be strong. And I definitely don’t have time for tests. But fine. Do your tests. Get it over with. Blood and… stool. Lovely. Just tell me what I need to do, and make it quick. I need to get back to work. Is there anything else? Because frankly, I'm losing patience. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration. IBS isn't inherently serious, but it can be very uncomfortable and disruptive. It’s more about managing the symptoms to improve your quality of life. The tests will help us rule out other possibilities, like infection or inflammation. I'll have the nurse draw a standard blood panel – CBC, CMP, and a thyroid panel. For the stool sample, she'll give you a collection kit with instructions. It’s a relatively simple process. Just collect a small sample and bring it back to the lab within 72 hours. While we're waiting for the test results, I'm going to recommend a low-FODMAP diet. That means reducing certain carbohydrates that can ferment in your gut and cause bloating. The nurse can give you a list of foods to avoid. I also suggest drinking plenty of water, and trying to manage stress – I know that's easier said than done with your job, but even small things can help. Does that sound manageable?
