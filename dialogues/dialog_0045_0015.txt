DOCTOR: Alright, Mikeisha. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Billman. It's… my sinuses, I think. They been botherin' me. It’s hard to explain, exactly what is botherin’ me, though. Just… not good.
DOCTOR: "Not good," huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It’s… a pressure, mostly. Behind my eyes, and in my face. Like when you have a bad cold, but… not exactly a cold. I don't feel feverish, if that makes sense. It just… aches. It’s been going on for… a while now. I forget how long, really. A few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: A few weeks of pressure… okay. And is this pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly constant, I think. But… some days are worse than others. When it rains, it feels much, much worse. And… when I bend over. Does that make sense, Doctor? It's like somethin' is… stuck. But there’s nothin’ in there, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So worse with rain, worse bending over... Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this pressure?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me see. I… I've been tired. Very tired. But I work long hours, so… maybe that’s just from that? And… sometimes my nose feels… blocked. Not all the time, though. I can breathe, mostly. Oh! And… sometimes I smell things that aren't there. Like… a sweet smell. It goes away quickly, but it's strange. I don't know if that's connected.
DOCTOR: Smelling things that aren't there... Right. Alright. Have you had any recent fevers, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I remember. Like I said, no fever. And… my body doesn't hurt. Just… tired. And this pressure. It's just… wearin' me down, you know? It's hard to concentrate at work when my head feels like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you tried anything to relieve the pressure?
PATIENT: Well… I tried some… over-the-counter stuff. You know, for colds. But it didn't help much. Just made my stomach upset, mostly. And… my husband, he gave me some tea. Herbal tea. It tasted nice, but it didn’t fix the problem. I don't really… take a lot of medicine, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. He makes it himself. He says it helps with… everything. I don’t know. It's just… tea. It's warm. I try to rest when I can, but… work is work, you know? I have a family to feed. It's a rotary drill job, you know… It's hard work. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Now, I'm going to press around your sinuses here. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. There is some tenderness here, on both sides. And your nasal passages seem a bit congested. It doesn't sound like pneumonia, thankfully. Lungs are clear. But this… it could be a sinus infection, or maybe just a bad case of allergies. I'll need to take a look inside your nose. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Yes, that hurts a little bit. Right there. And right here… Oh! Yes, definitely there. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My husband, he’s allergic to cats, but I’m not. We don’t have any pets. I sometimes get itchy eyes in the spring, but… I just thought it was the sun. I don’t really know about allergies, Doctor. I’ve never really had to worry about them. .
DOCTOR: Alright… well, your nasal passages are a bit swollen and there’s some… discharge. It doesn’t look horrendous, but it’s definitely not normal. It could be a bacterial sinus infection. It's more than allergies. I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic. Take it as directed, even if you start feeling better before you finish the course. Also, I recommend a saline nasal spray to help clear out the congestion. If it doesn’t improve in a week, come back and we’ll consider a referral to an ENT specialist. Do you have any questions for me?
