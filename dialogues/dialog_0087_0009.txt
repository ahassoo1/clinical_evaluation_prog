DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Alcorta. My name is Dr. Soodeen. Welcome to the clinic. It's August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's my vision, Doctor. It’s… deteriorating. It’s not a sudden thing, mind you. It’s been… a gradual decline. I suppose I should have come in sooner, but frankly, I didn't think it was worth the trouble until it became… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual decline in vision. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What exactly do you need to know? It's… harder to see things, naturally. Distances especially. And reading… reading is becoming increasingly difficult. I used to be able to read anything, small print, large print, didn't matter. Now? I need… assistance. It’s quite frustrating, I assure you. I’ve always prided myself on my intellect. It's… unpleasant to be reliant on others for something so simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. It's certainly difficult when a valued skill becomes challenging. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a… tricky question. Probably… a year or so ago? Maybe a little longer. It was subtle at first. Just needing a bit more light, perhaps. Then things seemed… fuzzier around the edges. I chalked it up to fatigue, honestly. I spend a good deal of time on the computer for work, you know. Human Resources. Lots of forms. Though, even away from the screen… it’s the same. I really can’t put an exact date on it. Time… it tends to blur, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Alcorta. And computer use can certainly contribute to eye strain. Aside from the gradual blurring, have you noticed any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well, let me think. It's not like things go black, if that’s what you’re asking. No sudden spots or… flashes of light. It’s just… dimmer, overall. Colors don’t seem as vibrant as they used to. And sometimes, when I look at something, it’s… difficult to make out the details. It's like looking through a… a veil, perhaps? A thin one, admittedly, but noticeable nonetheless. It’s not terribly dramatic, but it’s there. And becoming more pronounced, I'm afraid. I certainly wouldn't describe it as comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “dimmer overall” and less vibrant colors, like looking through a veil. Thank you for describing that so clearly. Have you had any recent changes in your overall health?
PATIENT: Changes in my overall health? Doctor, I maintain a perfectly sensible lifestyle. I eat reasonably well – mostly. And I certainly don’t partake in any… unhealthy habits. I had a bit of a cold last winter, a common ailment, nothing serious. Aside from that… no. No major illnesses. No surgeries. I’m not a fragile man. Frankly, I find the question somewhat… insulting. I haven’t felt unwell. My vision is the problem, not some supposed systemic ailment.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across as insulting, Mr. Alcorta. It's simply standard procedure to gather a complete health history. Let's move on. Do you have any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s… complicated. My mother’s side… well, they weren’t particularly forthcoming about such things. A rather… private bunch. My father… he wore glasses, I believe, but I don’t recall the specifics. Cataracts, perhaps? It was a long time ago. And truthfully, I wasn’t terribly interested in his health matters. It wasn’t something we discussed. The Cherokee Nation… we tend to focus on more pressing concerns, not… eyesight. It's not a glamorous ailment, is it? I suspect there may have been some issues, but I couldn’t offer you any concrete details. A rather unhelpful answer, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Alcorta. It’s not always possible to have complete information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy body without the need for… artificial interventions. Vitamins? Perhaps a multivitamin occasionally, when I remember. Supplements? Good heavens, no. I don’t subscribe to those… fads. I believe in a sensible diet and a healthy lifestyle, not relying on pills and potions to… artificially prolong life. It's simply… unnecessary. And quite frankly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… tedious. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply cataloging my life choices?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Alcorta. I assure you, this information is helpful in determining the cause of your vision changes. One last question about your history, then we can move on to an examination. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really. Must we? Fine. I have… a mild reaction to ragweed, during the autumn months. A bit of a runny nose, nothing debilitating. And I once had a rather unpleasant experience with shellfish, years ago. A bit of hives, I believe. Aside from that… no. I am not plagued by a multitude of sensitivities. I consider myself a rather robust individual. Is that satisfactory? I trust we can now move on to the examination, before I become entirely… exasperated.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta, that is satisfactory. Thank you. Let’s move on to a brief eye examination. Could you please follow my penlight with your eyes?
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Sighs and slowly turns his head, following the penlight with a noticeable lack of enthusiasm.</stage> Proceed. Though I must warn you, Doctor, my patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Okay, pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Tracking is smooth, though slightly slow. I’m noting some mild ptosis in both eyelids, though it’s subtle. Now, can you read the smallest line on this chart that you can see?
PATIENT: It’s… rather blurry, Doctor. Honestly, I’m struggling to distinguish anything beyond the… larger letters. Perhaps the second line from the top? It’s difficult to say with certainty. My vision is clearly… compromised. This isn’t exactly a revelation, is it? Though, I assure you, it wasn't always this bad. It’s a rather… disheartening experience. Is this… typical?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Approximately 20/70 vision in both eyes. That is consistent with moderate visual impairment. And the slight drooping of your eyelids, known as ptosis, could be contributing to your difficulty. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look at the front of your eyes. This won’t hurt. I’m noting some mild cataracts in both eyes, but they are not severe at this time. Also, there appears to be some dryness of the cornea.
PATIENT: Cataracts? Goodness. I… I suppose I shouldn't be entirely surprised, given my age. But… dryness? That's… odd. I haven't experienced any particular discomfort. Is this… serious, Doctor? Will I… go blind? My father… I believe he had some issues with his vision later in life. It wasn’t a pleasant sight, I assure you. Though, frankly, he wasn’t one for medical attention. This… is unsettling. Are there… treatments for these things? I'd rather not end up… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, please don't be alarmed. While cataracts and dry eye are concerning, they are often manageable. The cataracts are mild at this stage and aren’t currently causing significant vision loss. We can monitor them over time. The dry eye can be treated with artificial tears and other lubricating drops. Regarding your father, it’s important to remember that medical treatments have improved significantly over the years. To get a clearer picture of your condition, I recommend a comprehensive dilated eye exam with an ophthalmologist. This will allow us to assess the health of your retina and optic nerve, and rule out any other underlying causes for your vision changes. I will also order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels, as diabetes can sometimes affect vision. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist, you say? And a blood test? Good heavens. It seems this has… escalated rather quickly. Very well. If that’s what you deem necessary, Doctor, I suppose I have no choice. Though, frankly, I find the whole situation… rather inconvenient. I trust this ophthalmologist is… reputable? I don’t intend to spend my time with… amateurs. And the blood test… can’t that be avoided? I have a rather… aversion to needles. But if it’s essential, I suppose I can… endure it. Just… please assure me this won’t be a lengthy process. I have commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Alcorta. I will refer you to Dr. Emily Carter, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. I've worked with her for several years, and she is excellent. And the blood test is primarily to rule out diabetes, which can cause similar symptoms. It's a simple test, and should only take a few minutes. We can schedule it here at the clinic, if that’s preferable. In the meantime, I recommend using artificial tears twice a day to help with the dryness. I will write you a prescription for those. I'll also provide you with a list of resources on managing cataracts and dry eye. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Very well. Dr. Carter, you say? And a quick blood test. Artificial tears… twice a day. It seems I’m accumulating a rather… extensive medical regimen. I suppose it’s better to address these things now, rather than… let them worsen. Though, frankly, I remain skeptical. My father… he wasn't one for preventative care, and… well, it didn't end well. Very well, Doctor. Proceed with the referrals and the blood test. Just… please make it as… expeditious as possible. I have… commitments, you know. And frankly, I’d rather not dwell on this any longer than necessary. .
