DOCTOR: Hi Lacreasha, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's... the nails. They just look funny, okay? Not like they used to. I don't... I don't know what's wrong with them. It's just... annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” nails. I understand. It's good you’re bringing it up, even if it’s just annoying you. Can you tell me a little more about what “funny” means?
PATIENT: Well... they're kinda... bumpy. And not all of 'em, just some. And they're... thick, I guess. I don't do much with 'em, you know? No fancy polish or anything. Just... nails. I don't even remember when they started lookin' like this. A while ago, I think. Probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, bumpy and thickened nails on some fingers, and it’s been happening for a while. That gives us a starting point. Do you notice any changes in the color of the nails as well?
PATIENT: Color? Hmm... I dunno. They're kinda... pale, maybe? Not bright, like they used to be. But I don't look at my nails much, so how would I know? They're just... nails. Are they supposed to be a certain color?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, most people don’t routinely examine their nails! Healthy nails usually have a pinkish tone, but variations are normal. Pale nails can sometimes be a sign of something going on, but it’s not always a cause for concern. Now, have you noticed any pain or discomfort with your nails at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt. Just... weird lookin'. Sometimes they get caught on things 'cause they're thick, but that's just annoying, not painful. It's mostly just... a bother, really. I just want 'em to look normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s absolutely not too much to ask. We'll try to figure out what's going on. Okay, so no pain, just changes in appearance and some catching on things due to the thickness. Have you noticed this happening on all ten nails at different times, or is it consistently just a few fingers affected?
PATIENT: Uh... I think... mostly the big toe nails. And maybe one or two of the fingers. Not all of 'em, definitely. It comes and goes, I think. Or maybe it just feels like it does. I don't pay attention, okay? I got other things to worry about. Like... everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lacreasha. “Everything” takes up a lot of headspace. So, primarily the toenails, and occasionally a finger or two. And it doesn’t seem to be consistently the same ones affected. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I got... Medicare, that's something. And... the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once. But I don't take pills for it or anything. I try to eat okay. Don't know about anything else. I don't really... go to the doctor much. Don't like it, okay? Everything's always a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare, a past mention of slightly elevated blood pressure, and you generally try to eat healthily. That’s helpful to know. No other diagnosed medical conditions that you’re aware of, and you don’t usually visit the doctor frequently. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not a thing. I don't like all those pills. Make me feel funny. Just... nothing. I drink tea sometimes. Does that count? It's just tea, okay? Regular tea. Not fancy stuff.
DOCTOR: Regular tea is perfectly fine, Lacreasha, that doesn’t count as medication! Okay, so no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, thinking about your family... Do you know if anyone in your family has ever had problems with their nails?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family... Not that I know of. My mom... she didn't pay attention to things like nails. And my brother... well, we don't talk much. So I have no idea. Probably not, okay? Everyone's always busy with their own stuff. Nails are the least of anyone's worries.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of nail problems. Alright. Now, just a few more questions to get a better picture. Do you work with your hands a lot?
PATIENT: I'm an audiologist, okay? So I'm always fiddling with ears. But it's not like... heavy work. It's mostly small tools and stuff. Not like buildin' things or anything. Just... listenin' and lookin' in ears. That's my job. It's not hard work, okay? Just... detail work.
DOCTOR: Detail work with small tools. That’s good to know. Alright, Lacreasha, thanks for answering all those questions. It gives me a much better idea of what’s going on. Now, I’m going to take a look at your nails to get a closer look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Just... be gentle, okay? They're kinda sensitive, I think. Not 'cause of pain, just... 'cause they're weird. Hurry up though, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some thickening and discoloration of a few of the toenails, and some mild irregularity on a couple of the fingernails. The texture is a little rough, as you mentioned. It doesn’t appear inflamed, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing here, it’s possible you have a mild fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. It’s quite common, especially with warm, moist environments. However, to be certain, we should do a simple test to confirm. It involves taking a small scraping from the nail to look at under a microscope. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fungal? Like... dirt? I don't like dirt. I wash my hands all the time. Scrapin'? No. Don't scrape me! That sounds awful. Is there any other way to know? I just want it fixed, okay? I don't want no scrapin' and lookin' at dirt under a thingy. Can't you just... give me a pill or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Lacreasha. It's not dirt exactly, it’s a microscopic organism that can thrive in warm, moist places. And the scraping is very quick and painless - just a tiny sample of the nail to send to the lab. It’s the most accurate way to confirm if it’s a fungus so we can choose the best treatment. However, if you’re really uncomfortable with the scraping, we can consider a trial of antifungal medication. But it’s important to know that without confirmation, it’s harder to know if it’s the right treatment, and it might not be as effective. Also, antifungal medications can have some side effects, so we want to be sure they're necessary. We can also discuss referral to a podiatrist, a foot specialist, who could offer another opinion and potentially other diagnostic options. What do you think would feel most comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Side effects? No. Definitely no side effects. Podia... what? That sounds expensive. Okay, fine. But just a little scrape, okay? And quick. No diggin' or nothin'. And don't tell me it's gonna hurt. I don't like being hurt. Just... get it over with. But hurry up, okay? I got appointments. And no talkin' about side effects! That's a bad sign.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lacreasha, just a quick, small scrape. No digging, I promise. And I won't mention side effects unless absolutely necessary. I'll be quick and gentle. Alright, let's start with the big toe on your right foot. It looks the most affected. I’m just going to gently file a tiny bit of the nail surface, then collect the clippings. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't hurt. Just a little bit here... and there... Almost done. Okay, that's it. We have enough for the lab. We’ll send this off to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. We'll give you a call with the findings. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. A week. That's a long time. Don't lose it, okay? I don't want to have to come back again. Just call me, okay? And no side effects, remember? I'm serious. And can I get a little something for the pain just in case? Maybe a band-aid? It's kinda sore now, even if you say it doesn't hurt. Gotta be prepared, okay? Everything's always a mess if you're not prepared.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lacreasha. We won’t lose the sample, I assure you. And I've made a note about your concern regarding side effects – we’ll discuss all treatment options thoroughly once we have the lab results. Here you go. Just a little band-aid for peace of mind. It’s normal to feel a little sensitivity afterward, even with a gentle scraping. So, while we wait for the lab results, if you notice any changes—like redness, swelling, or increased pain—please give us a call immediately. Otherwise, we’ll be in touch in about a week. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just... call me. And no side effects, okay? I gotta go. Appointments, okay? Lots of appointments. Bye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lacreasha. We will call you with the results, and we'll definitely discuss all options with you. No side effects – noted. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
