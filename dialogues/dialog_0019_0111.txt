DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, let’s get this over with, shall we? I haven’t got all day. It’s… my skin. It’s darkening. And I’m terribly fatigued. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve been working, of course. Always working. But it seems… worse lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll get to the bottom of it. Darkening skin and fatigue… that's definitely worth looking into. When you say “darkening skin,” can you tell me a little more about where it's darkening?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. Everywhere, I suppose. Arms, face… perhaps my legs? It’s difficult to say. I don’t spend much time looking at myself, you see. Too busy doing things. Is it important where exactly? It’s all… brownish, I think. A rather unpleasant shade. Really, I’d appreciate it if you could just tell me what’s wrong and give me something to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. Knowing where is helpful, but we'll work with what we have. Generalized skin darkening… has this been happening gradually, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… a while, hasn’t it? Perhaps a few months? I do recall noticing it more prominently after a particularly strenuous job last spring. A lot of sun, naturally. Though I always take precautions... well, some precautions. It’s the fatigue that’s really troubling. Makes it difficult to focus. I need to be sharp, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. A few months, with worsening after sun exposure… that’s useful information. And the fatigue is definitely concerning. Has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Goodness. What do you mean? Life continues, Doctor. One works, one eats, one sleeps… or tries to, lately. I suppose my wife has been… fussing more. Complaining about my temper, mostly. But that’s nothing new. She always has something to say. Is that what you mean? Changes? I haven’t been feeling ill, if that’s what you're asking. Just… tired. And this discoloration. Really, it’s quite unsightly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Perhaps a bit of thirst. But I live in a hot climate, and working outside makes one thirsty, naturally. No… no fever, no chills, no… aches, I suppose. Just… this persistent tiredness. And the skin. Really, Doctor, is it something serious? I haven’t got time for a long illness. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Drahota. We'll try to figure this out as quickly as possible. Would you mind if I take a look at your skin and check your vital signs?
PATIENT: Must you? Very well. But please be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. And try not to poke too much. I bruise easily. Old age, you understand. Go ahead, then. But do hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I'll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 110/70, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your lungs sound clear. Skin appears diffusely hyperpigmented without any obvious lesions or rashes. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No noticeable swelling. I’ll also check your hands and feet for any signs of edema. No edema present.
PATIENT: Lower side? Is that bad? My father had… problems with his blood pressure. Though that was years ago. And hyper… what was that? It all sounds rather ominous, Doctor. I trust you’re not suggesting I take time off work? I have a schedule to keep, you know. This better not be anything serious. Really.
DOCTOR: Hyperpigmentation simply means increased darkening of the skin, Mr. Drahota. It doesn't necessarily indicate anything serious, but we need to determine the cause. Your blood pressure is mildly low, but not currently a cause for immediate concern. Given your fatigue and skin discoloration, I’d like to order some blood tests. This will help us rule out a few possibilities – things like adrenal insufficiency, which can cause both fatigue and skin changes, as well as check your kidney and liver function. It will also tell us about your blood sugar levels, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite tedious. Very well. If it must be done. But I expect a quick turnaround. I haven’t got all day to be waiting for results. And… will it interfere with my work schedule? I need to know. This is all rather inconvenient. Perhaps there’s a simpler explanation? Some sort of cream, perhaps? A tonic? I trust you have something more expedient than a battery of tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. A simpler explanation is always preferable, but given your symptoms, blood tests are the most responsible course of action to ensure an accurate diagnosis. They shouldn’t significantly interfere with your work schedule; the blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. It may take a few days for the results to come back. While we wait, I would recommend avoiding prolonged sun exposure and staying well-hydrated. I’ll give you a lab requisition form now. Once you’ve had the blood tests done, the lab will send the results directly to me. I'll then contact you to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… hurry, please. I have things to do. And make sure the results are sent promptly. I don’t appreciate delays. Good day, Doctor. I trust this will be the end of it.
