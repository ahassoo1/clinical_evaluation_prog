DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 26 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like it says on the paper. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Ms. Dudney. However, simply stating “high blood pressure” is… insufficient for a proper medical assessment. We need to understand how we know about the high blood pressure, and more about your overall health. Now, can you tell me when you were first told you had high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? My husband’s cousin is a nurse, and she took it at a family get-together. Last month, I think. It was high then, and my regular doctor confirmed it a week ago. Look, I'm a civil engineering tech, I don’t have time to remember dates. Does it matter when it was? It’s high now, isn't that enough?
DOCTOR: While a confirmation from your primary care physician is helpful, knowing the initial reading and timeframe does matter, Ms. Dudney. It helps us establish a baseline and determine the severity. Very well. Let’s proceed. Has your regular doctor initiated any treatment for the hypertension at this point?
PATIENT: No. He wanted me to come here for… a second opinion, he said. Something about wanting a “different perspective.” Honestly, I think he just wanted me out of his hair. He just told me to monitor it and come see someone. So, no treatment. Nothing. I just… take my own blood pressure when I remember, with the machine my husband bought.
DOCTOR: I see. A second opinion is not unreasonable, and monitoring at home is… a start. Now, Ms. Dudney, could you tell me what your typical blood pressure readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really look at the numbers, okay? I just see if it’s in the green, yellow, or red zone on the machine. Mostly yellow, sometimes red when I'm stressed. My husband looks at them more. He worries too much. He's got a spreadsheet or something.
DOCTOR: A green, yellow, or red zone system… is not a substitute for actual numbers, Ms. Dudney. It is difficult to assess the severity and guide treatment without quantifiable data. Do you happen to know the model number of the blood pressure machine your husband purchased?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want the model number? Okay, hold on. He's got everything organized… … Let me see… He always names everything. It’s… Omron Evolv, I think? Yeah, Omron Evolv. He said it connects to his phone. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Omron Evolv, excellent. That model allows for data tracking, which is… helpful. Now, Ms. Dudney, aside from the elevated blood pressure, are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel fine. Tired, maybe. But that’s just from work, you know? Long hours, lots of pressure to get things done. I’m not about to start listing every little ache and pain, honestly. Is that what you want? Because I do not have time for that.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Dudney, I am not asking you to list every minor discomfort. I am referring to symptoms related to potentially elevated blood pressure. Headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, vision changes, chest pain… anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Look, I’m perfectly healthy, okay? A little stressed, maybe, but that's life. My husband worries too much, he's always asking if I feel okay. I eat okay, I work hard. I don't sit around all day. Seriously, is this going somewhere? Or are you just trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Dudney, my intention is not to find something wrong, but to gather information and assess your overall health risk. Stress can contribute to hypertension, but it doesn't explain everything. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never. I told you, I'm healthy. My regular doctor always says I’m “remarkably healthy for my age.” He probably just says that to get me out of his office faster. Seriously, are we almost done? I have a meeting this afternoon. A real meeting, not one where you ask me about the model number of a blood pressure machine.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Dudney. Let’s discuss your family history, then. Do either of your parents, siblings, or grandparents have high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. My grandmother, on my mom's side... she had something with her heart, I think. She was really old. She died when I was little. That's all I really know. My mom and dad are fine. My brother… I don’t talk to him much. Probably fine, too. Honestly, I don’t keep up with all that family stuff. Is that enough? Can we please wrap this up?
DOCTOR: I will make a note of your grandmother's history. Now, Ms. Dudney, to complete a thorough assessment, I need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I do not smoke. My husband would kill me. He's very health conscious. Next question? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption, Ms. Dudney?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, if it’s been a long week. Honestly, that's it. I don't go out partying or anything. Look, I'm not a problem drinker, if that’s what you're implying. Is this leading to something? Are you going to tell me I’m a health risk? Just tell me what you think, already. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration. However, gathering a complete history is important. Based on the limited information you've provided – the recent diagnosis of hypertension confirmed by your primary care physician, a family history of heart problems, and occasional alcohol consumption – it is premature to make a definitive diagnosis or recommend a specific treatment plan. At this point, I recommend we conduct a physical examination. I would like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your kidneys. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Honestly, I do not have time for all of this. But I guess if you’re going to do something, that’s better than just asking questions about my drinking habits. Just hurry up, okay? I've got a meeting. A real meeting.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I will need to take your blood pressure first. Please keep your arm still and relaxed. 152 over 94. 158 over 96. Elevated, as expected. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly forceful. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Kidneys are not enlarged. Examination complete. Blood pressure is significantly elevated. Based on this initial assessment, and the limited information available, it appears you have Stage 1 Hypertension.
