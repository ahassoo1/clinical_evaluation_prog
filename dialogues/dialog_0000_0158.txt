DOCTOR: Right. Well, Deloris, please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, um… it’s about a letter. For my… well, for the little one. You know, the fluffy one. I need a letter saying I can have him, I think? It’s for… somewhere. Honestly, I can’t quite remember where exactly. It's all a bit of a fuss, really.
DOCTOR: A letter… for the “fluffy one”?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! He's a… a dog. A small one. Very small. A Shih Tzu, I believe. Though, honestly, they all look the same to me. People are making a big deal about needing proof or something. It’s ridiculous, isn’t it? You’d think they’d trust a woman of my… standing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you need a letter confirming you are the owner of a Shih Tzu. And this is… for what purpose, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that’s the part I’m hazy on. Something about… where I live? They said I needed it for the building. Rules, you know. Always rules. Honestly, I just want the paperwork done so they'll stop bothering me. It’s probably the landlord. Yes, definitely the landlord. He’s a stickler.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a letter for your landlord, confirming pet ownership for a Shih Tzu. Do you have any documentation already – perhaps a bill of sale, vaccination records, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Documentation… I highly doubt it. I mean, I got him from someone, of course. A nice young man. Online, I think? But I certainly didn’t ask for receipts or anything. Honestly, who does that when you're getting a companion? It feels so… transactional. I just paid him the money and took the little fluffball.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no paperwork. And you don’t recall the young man’s name or any contact information?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. Names just… slip my mind, you know? He had a very common name, I’m sure. Something like… David? Or maybe Michael? Honestly, they all blend together after a while. It was definitely through one of those… apps. For pets. Everyone uses them these days. It's all a bit of a blur, really. Why does it matter so much? It’s a perfectly lovely dog!
DOCTOR: It matters because, legally, establishing ownership is important. Especially when there are building regulations involved. Without some proof of purchase or adoption, it's difficult to confirm you are, in fact, the rightful owner of this Shih Tzu. We need to be able to verify this, Deloris. Do you recall when you acquired this dog?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… um… let me think. It was… before the holidays, I’m fairly certain. Last year, definitely. Before Christmas, maybe? Or was it after? Honestly, time just… flies. It was definitely in the colder months. I remember needing a bigger coat for him. He gets cold easily, that little one. It was… a long time ago, wasn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sometime before Christmas 2024. Without any documentation, and with no recollection of the seller's information, it’s going to be difficult to fulfill your request for a letter confirming ownership. I can write a note stating that you claim ownership, but this may not be sufficient for your landlord. Have you considered contacting the app where you obtained the dog?
PATIENT: An app? Oh, now that you mention it… I think I remember something about an app. A blue icon, maybe? With a paw print? But honestly, I have so many apps on my phone. It’s all a jumble. I doubt I’d even know where to begin looking. It sounds terribly complicated. Can’t you just… write the letter? Surely my word is good enough. I’m a respectable woman!
DOCTOR: Deloris, while I understand your frustration, a letter solely based on your statement isn’t legally sound. It won't protect you, or the dog, if your landlord decides to pursue this further. It's possible the dog was obtained illegally, or even stolen, and we need to rule that out. I’m obligated to act in a responsible manner. Have you had this dog vaccinated?
PATIENT: Vaccinated? Oh, yes, I think so. The vet… somewhere near the park? A very nice young woman. She gave him a little sticker. A star, I believe. But I don’t recall the name of the clinic. Honestly, I just bring him in for his yearly check-ups and let them do whatever they need to do. I don’t really pay attention to the details. It's all a bit… clinical, you know? I just want him to be healthy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s important, yes. But without a record of vaccination, or the vet’s information, it further complicates establishing a history of ownership. Look, Deloris, I’m going to be blunt. You’ve acquired a dog with no documentation, no recollection of the seller, and minimal recall of veterinary care. Writing a letter confirming ownership in this situation is irresponsible. What I can do is recommend you contact local animal shelters and veterinary clinics, see if anyone recognizes the dog. Beyond that, you may need to consult with a legal professional regarding pet ownership rights. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Legal professional? Now you're just scaring me! Honestly, I just wanted a simple letter. This is all so much fuss over a little fluffy dog. I didn’t realize it was going to be so… difficult. I suppose… I suppose you're right. It is a bit irresponsible, isn't it? I just… I just love the little one. This is a terrible situation. .
DOCTOR: Deloris, I understand your distress. I recommend you gather any information you can – anything at all – regarding the seller or the veterinary clinic. And as I mentioned, a legal consultation might be beneficial. Here’s a list of local animal shelters and veterinary clinics. .
