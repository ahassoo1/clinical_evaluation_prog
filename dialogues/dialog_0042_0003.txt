DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, let’s not waste time. My hand… it shakes. Been happenin’ for a bit now. Gets worse when I try to… well, when I try to do things. Honestly, it's just bothersome. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand you'd like to get straight to the point. We can certainly do that. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Roughly? Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Months, maybe? A year? It all blends together after a while, you know? I used to have a steady hand, a very steady hand. Important when you’re directing, very important. Now… not so much. Is that good enough? Really, I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: That gives me a starting point, thank you. And you mentioned you used to be a director – that’s interesting. Has the shaking interfered with anything specific lately?
PATIENT: Interfered? Everything! Trying to eat soup is a disaster. Holding a glass… forget about it. And… well, I tried to sketch a little. Just a quick design, for a… a project. Couldn’t even hold the pencil straight. It was… humiliating, frankly. A man should be able to hold a pencil. What kind of question is this anyway?
DOCTOR: It helps me understand the impact this is having on your daily life, Mr. Baide. So, it's affecting fine motor skills – things like eating, drinking, and sketching. And you said it's worsened over time. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? No, not constant. It's worse when I'm tryin’ to do somethin’. Relaxin’ on the sofa, nothin’. Try to pick up a fork… it starts. It’s… unpredictable. I don't plan my tremors, you know. It just… happens. Look, is this gonna take long? I have things to do. Very important things.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. So, the shaking is primarily activity-related. Does anything specifically make it better or worse besides resting and activity?
PATIENT: Better? Worse? Honestly, I haven’t been cataloging every little thing, Doc! Coffee sometimes seems to… settle me, maybe? Though it also makes it worse later. It's a vicious cycle. And stress. Definitely stress. Although, what doesn’t cause stress these days? Look, I just want somethin’ to stop it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Coffee and stress are good things to note. It sounds like caffeine and emotional state might play a role. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What are you, a detective now? Look, I’m an old man. Things ache. I get tired. What kind of other symptoms are you expectin’? I haven't been feelin' particularly… energetic, if that’s what you mean. But that’s just age, Doc. Plain and simple. Don't go lookin' for somethin' that isn’t there. Really. It's a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Baide. Just trying to get a complete picture. When you say you feel tired, is that just general fatigue, or do you find yourself feeling weak in your muscles, perhaps beyond what you’d expect with age?
PATIENT: Weak? No! I'm not weak. I’ve directed films, you know. It takes stamina. I get tired. Like after a long day. Not like… I can’t lift a glass, if that’s what you’re insinuating. It’s just… exhaustion. A perfectly normal part of gettin’ old. Honestly, Doc, are we done yet? This is rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm being intrusive, Mr. Baide. I’m just trying to rule things out. Okay, so no significant weakness, just fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either losing or gaining?
PATIENT: Weight? Now you're askin' about my weight? What does my weight have to do with my hand shakin'? I… maybe a little. I haven't been eatin' as much, to be honest. Soup’s hard to manage, remember? And when you're tired, you don't feel like cookin'. It's probably just… less appetite. Can we please get to the part where you tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some weight loss alongside the fatigue and shaking. And you mentioned no significant weakness. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Look, I’m eighty years old! What don't I have? High blood pressure, probably. Something with my cholesterol, I’m sure. The usual old man stuff. Honestly, Doc, I've seen doctors come and go. They all say the same thing: “Take these pills, avoid that food, get more sleep.” It's all… tedious. I take a pill for this, a pill for that. I don't remember specifics anymore, and frankly, I don't care. Is that helpful? Can we just… skip this part? I’m sure it’s somethin’ simple. Just fix my hand. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. Knowing you have high blood pressure and cholesterol helps. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, for these or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Medications… uh… there’s a little white pill I take every mornin’. And a bigger blue one at night. For my… blood, I think. And somethin' for my… stomach? I honestly can't recall the names. My wife used to handle all that. It’s been a while since she… well, never mind. Look, I have a bottle somewhere, but finding it would take all day. Is it really necessary? I just need somethin' to stop this shakin'. It's drivin' me mad. .
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you’re on multiple medications, but we don't have the specifics right now. We can try to get a list from your pharmacy later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
