DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, good to meet you. Eighty-seven years young, impressive. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Yes, eighty-seven. Long time, yes. My foot… it hurts. Very sore. On the bottom, you see? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not good.
DOCTOR: “A little while now…” Right. And when you say “a little while,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Maybe… two, three months, I think? Hard to say, really. Time goes fast when you get old, eh? It started small, just a little ache. Now… now it’s a real problem. Makes walkin’ difficult.
DOCTOR: Two to three months. Okay. And is it sore all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly sore when I stand and walk. When I sit with my foot up, it feels… better. Not gone, but better. But as soon as I try to walk around the house… oh boy. That’s when it really hurts. Feels like… a burnin’ and achin’ all at once.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to that foot, ever?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm… not that I recall, Doctor. I used to walk barefoot a lot when I was young, you know? On the island. Maybe stepped on some coral once or twice, but nothin’ serious. No breaks or nothin’ like that. I’ve had… the sugar problem, the doctor told me. A long time ago. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: The sugar problem, yes. Diabetes. And how well controlled has that been?
PATIENT: Eh, well… it goes up and down, you know? I try to eat right, mostly. But sometimes… I like a little sweet thing with my tea. Not too much! The doctor, before… he gave me pills. I take them, most days. But I forget sometimes, you know? Old age… it does things to your memory. I go to the doctor, but… I don't always understand everything he says.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure, Doctor. Small, white one. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. But not every day, only when it really bothers me. I get them from the drugstore. Is that bad? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. Let's have a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Eh? Oh, yes, yes, of course. Old hands not as quick as they used to be… There. It looks… not good, eh? Sorry to bother you with this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. This is… concerning. There's an ulcer present, and the surrounding tissue is… inflamed. And your foot feels quite warm to the touch. Given your history of diabetes, this could be a diabetic foot ulcer. These can be serious if left untreated, due to poor circulation and risk of infection. Do you have any pain with this ulcer?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh yes, Doctor. It aches all the time, like I said. But it’s worse when I put weight on it. And… sometimes it feels kinda… tingly. Like pins and needles. And lately, it smells kinda… funny. Sorry to be gross, but it's true. Is it bad, Doctor? Will I… will I lose my foot?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, let's not jump to conclusions. Losing your foot is not necessarily the outcome, but this does require immediate attention. The tingling sensation and the odor are concerning signs. Given your history and the current presentation, I’m going to order some blood work to assess your blood sugar levels and check for signs of infection. We also need to get an imaging study – an X-ray – of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. I’m also going to refer you to a podiatrist—a foot specialist—for evaluation and treatment. They’ll be able to properly debride the ulcer, which means remove any dead tissue, and assess the circulation in your foot. It’s crucially important that you keep all weight off this foot until we have more information, and that you strictly control your blood sugar levels. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… X-ray… podiatrist… So many things… I… I think I understand, Doctor. Keep weight off… control the sugar… but… all this sounds very serious. And… expensive? I just want to be able to walk again. Will Medicare cover all this? And… who is this podiatrist? Will they be nice? I don't like strangers touchin’ my feet.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand your concerns. It is a lot to take in. Yes, Medicare should cover these services, but there may be co-pays or deductibles depending on your plan. We have staff here who can assist you with navigating the billing process. I'm going to give you a referral to Dr. Alana Kahele, she's a highly respected podiatrist here in the city. Her office is at 123 Main Street. I’ll have the staff print out her contact information and a referral form for you. As for being “nice”… Dr. Kahele is a professional. She understands this can be uncomfortable, and she will explain everything as she goes. The most important thing right now is to get this addressed promptly. Delaying treatment could lead to more serious complications, including infection and, yes, potentially requiring more extensive procedures. I’m going to order those blood tests and X-ray right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician will be expecting you. Do you think you can manage that, or would you like me to have a nurse assist you?
PATIENT: Hmm… a nurse, maybe. Yes, that would be good. My legs aren’t what they used to be, and I get a little… confused sometimes. The lab… and the X-ray… 123 Main Street… Okay. A nurse would be good. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ everything. It's still scary, but… I appreciate it. Will I be able to walk to the store again? That’s all I really want.
DOCTOR: We’ll do everything we can, Mr. Stoegbauer. That’s the goal. The outcome will depend on how well you follow the treatment plan and how quickly we can get the infection under control. But let's focus on getting through these initial steps – the blood work, the X-ray, and seeing Dr. Kahele. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to assist you. Do you have any other questions for me right now before we get started?
PATIENT: Eh… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. And… thank you again. I’m ready when you are.
