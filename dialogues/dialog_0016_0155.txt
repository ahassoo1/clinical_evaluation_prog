DOCTOR: Hi Lyman, good to see you. I'm Dr. Maskal. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… something with my hands, I think. They shake. Not all the time, but… enough to bother me. It’s been going on for a bit, but I figured I should get it checked out. Don't really remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, hand shaking. We can definitely look into that. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “a bit”, can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail… hmm. It’s worse when I try to do things, you know? Like… holding a cup of coffee. Or buttoning my shirt. Simple things. Sometimes it's just a little quiver, other times… well, it's harder to control. It doesn’t hurt, though. Never any pain. Just… annoying. And I keep spilling things. My daughter gets upset about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's interfering with your daily activities – holding things, buttoning a shirt – and it’s worse with those movements. No pain, just a tremor. And it’s been happening enough that your daughter has noticed. About how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard one. A few months, maybe? Six? Could be longer. Time… it just slips away, you know? I used to work with… pipes. Water, mostly. Lots of wrenches. Maybe it started around then? I retired a while back. Everything gets muddled. Sorry. I’m not much help with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lyman, dates aren’t always easy to remember. So, several months, potentially starting around the time you retired from working with pipes. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse besides when you’re doing things?
PATIENT: Hmm. I… I don't think so. Not really. Coffee seems to make it a little worse, but… I drink coffee every morning. So maybe it’s just me being shaky anyway. And… when I get nervous, probably. But who isn't nervous sometimes? I can't say I've noticed anything specific. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific triggers other than potentially nervousness and maybe coffee, though you drink that regularly anyway. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Now you’re asking me something. Let me think. No… not that I recall. I get tired sometimes, but… I’m 79 years old! I figure that’s just getting old. My knees ache, too. But that’s been happening for years. I don’t think that’s related to the shaking. Honestly, Doctor, I just want my hands to stop trembling. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the hand shaking and typical aches and pains for someone your age. No other new symptoms. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… that's another tricky one. I saw a doctor years ago, a long time ago. I think they said my blood pressure was a little high at one point, but I don’t take any pills for it. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. Never seemed necessary. And my memory… well, you've already noticed. I honestly can't remember if I was ever told about anything else. I’m divorced, if that matters. Don't have much family around to remind me of things, either. My daughter, she tries, but… she’s busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but currently not on any medication for it. And you don’t have a strong recollection of any other diagnosed medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia fixed, maybe? Something like that. It was years ago, and I don’t remember much about it. They fixed it and I went home. That's all I really recall. Nothing major recently. I try to stay out of hospitals, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix as a child and potentially a hernia repair at some point. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't take pills. Never really liked them. I might take an aspirin if I have a headache, but that's it. And very rarely. I prefer to just… tough it out, you know? I don’t want to become dependent on things. And like I said, my memory… I’d probably forget to take them anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My daughter always worries about shellfish, but I’ve never had a problem with it. I haven't broken out in any rashes or had trouble breathing. Nothing like that. I don’t wear a lot of fancy jewelry, so no metal allergies either. Nope, I’m pretty good in that department, thankfully. One less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had tremors, Parkinson's disease, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… difficult. My parents are gone, and I didn't really keep up with my relatives. I had an uncle… maybe? He wasn't very well. Spent a lot of time in bed. I don't know what he had, honestly. And… I don’t recall anyone else with shaking hands or anything like that. It wasn't something we talked about much. We weren't a very talkative family. I wish I knew more, but I just don’t. It’s frustrating. Sorry, Doctor. I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lyman. It’s common not to have a complete family history. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it didn't do him any good. Alcohol… I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. A long time ago. But I don't drink anymore. Not for many years. It just… didn't agree with me. And again, my daughter doesn’t approve. I try to keep her happy. Now, can we get this over with? This remembering… it's tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and no current alcohol use. Alright, let's do a quick exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands closely. It won't be painful. Can you just relax your arms at your sides for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. Just… try to be quick, if you would. And please, don't tell me what everything means. I’ll just worry more. Just… tell me what you find, if you find anything. And please don’t ask me to remember things. It’s like trying to catch smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman, I’m checking your reflexes now… good. And I'm going to have you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed. Then touch my finger. Alright, good. And now, I’m going to look at your hands. I can see a tremor when you're at rest, and it seems to increase when you reach for something. Your muscle tone feels slightly stiff, but not significantly. And your grip strength seems a bit weaker than expected. I don’t see any other obvious abnormalities. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: It's… harder than it looks. Is it… bad? Please don’t tell me it’s something awful. My daughter… she worries enough already. Just tell me what it is, if you can, and what I should do. I don’t need a lot of explaining. Just… what’s going on? And will it… get worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman. Based on what I've seen, and considering your age and symptoms, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. It's a common neurological condition that causes a rhythmic shaking, often in the hands, and it can become more noticeable with age. It’s not usually a sign of a more serious condition. It's important to note that I can't give you a definitive diagnosis without some further testing. We will need to order a blood test to rule out other causes. But, most people can manage it well with lifestyle adjustments or medication if needed. Now, to be thorough, I also want to order a thyroid test and a complete metabolic panel. It’s just to make sure there isn’t anything else going on. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Whatever you think is best. As long as it’s not something… terrible. But please, don’t expect me to remember what any of it means. And can we get it over with quickly? I’m tired, Doctor. And my daughter… she’ll want to know all the details, and I just… I don’t have the energy for details. Can I go home now? After the blood work, of course. Is there anything I can do right now to make it stop shaking? Just for a little while?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lyman. We’ll get the blood work done right away, and I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. As for making it stop shaking right now… unfortunately, there's no quick fix. However, sometimes focusing on a task or holding something heavy can help reduce the tremor temporarily. We can discuss strategies for managing it once we have the test results back. I'm going to write you a prescription for a notebook and pen. Keeping a log of when your tremors occur and what seems to trigger them can be very helpful. And I'll have my nurse draw up a list of resources about essential tremor for you and your daughter. We can talk about possible medications at your follow-up appointment if the tremor continues to bother you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A notebook… alright. I used to write a lot, when I was younger. Before the pipes, before… everything. Fine. A notebook. And a list for my daughter. She’ll like that. She always wants to know everything. Thank you, Doctor. Now, can we please get this blood work done? I just want to go home and sit down. It's been a long morning. And… please, try not to ask me to remember too much.
