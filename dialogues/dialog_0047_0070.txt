DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes. Doctor. Good morning to you too. I… new here. Just moved. Need… what you call it… the check-up. Social thing. Medicare, you know? Not sick, just… seeing if everything still works. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. A general check-up. Medicare physical. Very good. Well, “seeing if everything still works” is a perfectly valid reason to come in, Mr. Szmyd. Let's start with a bit of history. Can you tell me about any major medical issues you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Major… issues? Oh, goodness. So many years. I… worked with the theatre, you see. Lots of… dust. And costumes. Heavy costumes. Maybe… a broken rib once? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. I forget. Everything gets… blurry after a while. I had some trouble with my… insides, years back. But they fixed it, I think. In… Russia. Long, long ago.
DOCTOR: Right. Theatre work, dust, heavy costumes… and some abdominal trouble treated in Russia. Do you remember what kind of abdominal trouble, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: Abdominal… hmm. Not really. Something with… the stomach, maybe? Or… something else. They cut me open, I think. Very skilled doctors, those Russians. Good with knives, they were. Lots of… poking. And prodding. It hurt for a while, but I got better. Mostly. I don't remember the name of it, if that's what you’re asking. Names… they slip away, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Surgery for an unspecified abdominal issue, a long time ago, in Russia. It’s not always easy to recall details from that far back, I understand. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. Never had allergies. I smoke, you know. Always have. A good cigarette… that’s a medicine in itself. And… high… what was it? High… pressure? Maybe. I get… flustered sometimes. Easily annoyed. Is that pressure? As for… heart problems? I still get a lot of passion in my work, so it must be working, yes? I do get… out of breath. But that's the smoking, probably.
DOCTOR: Right. You smoke. And you experience some shortness of breath and occasional irritability. We'll need to address the smoking. It’s a significant risk factor for several health problems. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. Let me think. No, no. Nothing regular. Sometimes… a little pill for my… nerves. When I'm very stressed. The wife… my ex-wife, she gave it to me. Little blue ones. But I haven't taken them in… years. Too many side effects. Made me… sleepy. And sad. So I stopped. Mostly I just drink tea. Strong tea. Helps with the nerves too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Intermittent use of a small blue pill for nerves, discontinued years ago. Let's move on to family history. Were there any significant medical problems in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she was… strong woman. Lived a long life. But she always complained about her… joints. Everything hurt. Arthritis, maybe? My father… he was a soldier. Very tough man. Never sick. But he… drank a lot. A lot of vodka. Maybe that’s why he didn’t get sick. Kills everything, you know? I don’t remember anyone having… cancer, or… that other thing. Stroke? No, no. Mostly just… strong people. Or… drinkers.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of joint pain in your mother and heavy alcohol consumption in your father. Now, Mr. Szmyd, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we can proceed with some basic blood work. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Poke and prod, if that's what you’re used to. Just… don’t take too long, alright? I have… things to do. Theatre doesn’t wait for anyone, you know. And… please, be gentle with my ears. They are… delicate.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit still and relax. 160 over 90… elevated. Heart sounds… somewhat irregular. Murmur present. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Mild cerumen impaction bilaterally. Ears appear otherwise normal, although delicate as you mentioned. Your blood pressure is quite high, and I’m hearing some concerning sounds in your heart and lungs. We’ll need to get some blood work and a chest X-ray to investigate further.
PATIENT: X-ray? Now you’re talking serious business. Is it… bad? I feel… alright. A little tired, maybe. And I cough sometimes, but that’s the smoking, isn't it? What did you say about my… heart? It still works, doesn’t it? I need my heart for the theatre! Is this… expensive? I’m on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I’m not saying it is bad, but these findings warrant further investigation. Elevated blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat, and decreased breath sounds are not normal, regardless of your smoking history. The chest X-ray will help us determine the cause of the decreased breath sounds—it could be anything from old infections to something more serious. The blood work will give us information about your overall health and help rule out other potential causes. As for the cost, Medicare should cover most of it, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. Our billing department can provide you with a detailed estimate. We are not here to speculate on the state of your theatre work, Mr. Szmyd. We are here to ensure your health. I’m ordering the blood work and a chest X-ray. Do you have any questions about where to go for these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… always tests. Fine, fine. Do what you need to do. The chest… X-ray? Is it… dangerous? And the blood work… will it take long? I have a rehearsal on Tuesday. Important rehearsal. And Tuesday… it’s not so far away. As for where… just tell me where. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I just moved here, remember? Everything is new.
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray is very low risk, Mr. Szmyd. It uses a minimal amount of radiation. And the blood work should only take about 30 minutes. Here is a referral to the lab at Suburban General Hospital, and the radiology center is just around the corner. I’d like to see you back here next week to discuss the results. We need to address your blood pressure and investigate the cause of your shortness of breath and heart murmur. This is important, Mr. Szmyd. Ignoring these issues will only lead to more serious problems down the line. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I understand. Hospital, radiology… next week. Fine. As long as it doesn't interfere with the rehearsal. The play… it's very important. Very demanding. Alright. I suppose I'll go then. Thank you… Doctor. You are very… thorough. Perhaps too thorough. .
