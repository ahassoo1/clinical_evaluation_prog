DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Lahn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s nice to meet you as well. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who really pushed me to come. Something about… weakness on one side? And headaches. It's a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. There's been some… trouble with that in the family, you see. My brother… he had awful headaches. And sometimes he just… couldn’t move his arm properly. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Tofani, that's very helpful. Weakness and headaches are definitely things we want to look into. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. And it is important to mention family history – that your brother experienced similar symptoms. Just to clarify, when you say weakness on one side, can you tell me which side?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Which side… Let me think. It feels like… the right side, yes. My right arm and leg, mostly. It doesn’t happen all the time, mind you. Comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little clumsy, other times… well, other times it’s harder to do things. It’s been… a while since it was really bad. But it worries my daughter. She’s a very sensible girl, that one. And she remembers things much better than I do!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, and it's good you have her support. Intermittent weakness on the right side is something we need to investigate. And these headaches… can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… They’re not always the same, you know? Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, like a band around my head. Other times… other times it feels like someone’s pressing on my temples, really hard. It’s usually on both sides, but sometimes it’s worse on the right. And they don’t last very long, usually. An hour, maybe a few hours. I take an aspirin, and it usually helps. I don’t get them every day, thankfully. It’s hard to say what brings them on, though. Sometimes it’s stress, sometimes it’s… nothing at all. Honestly, dear, I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. It’s common for headaches to vary. We’ll try to piece everything together. You mentioned taking aspirin – does that fully relieve the pain each time?
PATIENT: Well… not always fully, no. Sometimes it takes a couple of aspirin. And sometimes… sometimes it just takes the edge off. It’s still there, just… quieter. And on very bad days, even the aspirin doesn't seem to do much good at all. Those days are rare, thank goodness. But they do happen. I usually just try to lie down in a dark room when that happens. My husband, bless his heart, he makes me some chamomile tea. That helps a little, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aspirin provides some relief, but isn’t always completely effective, and the pain can sometimes be severe enough that it doesn't help much at all. Thank you for sharing that. Now, aside from the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Not that I’ve noticed, really. I get a little tired, but I’m 83 years old, dear! I think that’s allowed. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I’ve had glasses for years. And my knees ache sometimes, but that’s just old age creeping up on me, I suppose. Oh… now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not often, though. Just a fleeting feeling, like the room is spinning for a moment. And I’ve been a little forgetful, of course. But like I said, I'm getting on in years! It's hard to say what's normal and what's not anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to articulate what you’re experiencing, Ms. Tofani. Fatigue, changes in vision, knee pain, occasional dizziness, and memory changes are all things we want to consider. Regarding the dizziness, can you tell me when you experience that?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… it’s not regular, you see. It doesn’t happen when I stand up or anything like that. It just… comes and goes. Usually when I’m walking around, or maybe when I’m turning my head. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds, like a little wobble. And it hasn’t happened very often lately, thankfully. I don't think it's anything serious. Maybe just a bit low on blood sugar? I do like my sweets, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know it's intermittent and brief. Low blood sugar is definitely a possibility. Now, Ms. Tofani, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a lot to remember. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, maybe ten, fifteen years ago? I take a pill for it, every day. A little white one. I’ve been taking it ever since. As for diabetes… I don’t think so. I had my blood sugar checked a few times, and the doctor said it was fine. Nothing serious. Heart problems… my husband, bless his heart, he had some trouble with his heart, but not me. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I used to walk every day, but my knees aren't what they used to be, so that's stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and have not been diagnosed with diabetes or heart problems. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Surgeries… Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Maybe thirty, forty years ago? It was causing me a lot of trouble. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was younger, a long, long time ago. That's it, I think. Nothing else. I've been lucky, all things considered. I've avoided having too many procedures.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've had a gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family medical history… My brother, like I mentioned, he had awful migraines. Really debilitating. And he had some trouble with his heart later in life. My mother, bless her soul, she had arthritis, really bad. She couldn’t move her hands towards the end. And… my father had high blood pressure, just like me. And… I think my aunt on my mother’s side had something with her memory… something the doctors called dementia, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, dear. I wasn’t very involved with family medical things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tofani, that’s helpful. History of migraines, heart problems, arthritis, high blood pressure, and possible dementia in the family. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. Not that I know of, dear. I eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any food, as far as I can remember. And… no, I don't think I'm allergic to any medications either. I've taken a lot of different things over the years, and nothing’s ever bothered me. I get a little sleepy when I take Benadryl, but that's to be expected, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Benadryl causing drowsiness is a common side effect. And finally, are you currently taking any medications or supplements besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the little white pill for my blood pressure, every morning. Sometimes I take aspirin, when my head hurts, but that's not every day. And… oh! My daughter gives me a vitamin D supplement sometimes, during the winter. She says I don’t get enough sunshine. That's it, I think. Nothing else. I try to keep things simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for high blood pressure, aspirin as needed, and a vitamin D supplement occasionally. Thank you, Ms. Tofani. That’s all very helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if anything hurts! My knees aren’t what they used to be, so be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be gentle. “Your blood pressure is 140/90. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Balance is slightly unsteady, but not significantly so. Coordination is good with finger-to-nose testing, but there's a slight slowness on the right side.” Okay, Ms. Tofani. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on your history and the physical exam, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue, potentially a stroke or transient ischemic attack, although it’s too early to say for sure. The slight weakness, dizziness, and slowness on your right side are concerning, and your history of high blood pressure is a risk factor. I think we need to get some imaging done to get a better look at your brain. I’d like to order a CT scan and possibly an MRI. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan and an MRI… That sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I mean, I feel alright, mostly. Just a little tired, and my knees ache, like I said. But you said something about… a stroke? I’ve heard of those, and they don’t sound very pleasant. I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily, but she’s the one who brought me in, so she’ll want to know. What exactly are we looking for? And will it hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded, you know.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Tofani. I want to be upfront with you, and that's why I'm suggesting these scans. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have a stroke, but it’s important to rule it out. The scans will help us see if there’s been any damage to your brain and identify the cause of your symptoms. The CT scan is quick and painless – you’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take X-rays of your head. The MRI is a bit longer and involves lying in a scanner that uses magnets and radio waves. It's also painless, but it can be a little noisy and you’ll need to lie very still. We can provide earplugs and a comfortable environment. We are looking for any signs of bleeding, blockage, or damage to the brain tissue. The sooner we can identify the problem, if there is one, the better the chances of treatment. I'll explain everything to your daughter as well and answer any questions she may have. Would you like me to call her now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Call my daughter, Sarah. She’s the sensible one, like I said. She’ll know what to ask. And… I suppose if you think it’s best, we should do the scans. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything to her. I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily. And… will I be able to drive home afterwards? I usually drive myself.
DOCTOR: “Hello?
PATIENT: "Oh, good. Hello, Sarah? It's Dr. Lahn calling from the clinic. Your mother is here with me today, and we've been discussing her symptoms."
DOCTOR: "Oh, good. Hello, Sarah?
PATIENT: “Hi Dr. Lahn, thank goodness! I was just about to call the clinic to check on her. How is she doing?”
DOCTOR: “Hi Sarah, it’s good to speak with you. Your mother is doing okay, but we’ve identified some things that we need to investigate further. She’s been experiencing some weakness on one side, headaches, and dizziness. I’ve just completed a physical exam and, based on her history and my findings, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. I’m recommending a CT scan and potentially an MRI to get a better look at her brain." "I’ve explained everything to your mother, but I wanted to speak with you directly as well and answer any questions you may have. I want to be thorough and make sure we rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain the scans in more detail?
PATIENT: “Oh… okay. A scan… That sounds a little scary. What does that mean, exactly? Is she… is she having a stroke? That's what I was afraid of! She downplays everything, you know. What’s the next step? And… will she be able to come home today? I can come pick her up if she needs me to."
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Sarah. It’s good you’re being proactive. We don't know for sure if she's having a stroke, and that’s why we need the scans to get a clearer picture. The weakness, headaches, and dizziness could be symptoms of a stroke, but they can also be caused by other things. The CT scan is a quick X-ray of the brain, and the MRI uses magnets to create more detailed images. Both are painless, but the MRI takes longer and requires lying very still. Based on the results of the scans, we’ll determine the best course of action. It’s likely she’ll need to stay at the clinic for a few hours after the scans so we can monitor her. I wouldn't recommend driving herself home today, and it would be best if you could pick her up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: “Okay, that makes sense. A few hours… yes, I can definitely pick her up. I’ll come right away. I just… I want to make sure she gets the best care possible. She always says she's fine, even when she’s clearly not. And… are there any specific questions I should ask her on the way to the clinic? To help you with the assessment? Or anything she should be avoiding right now?”
DOCTOR: “That’s very thoughtful of you, Sarah. It’s helpful to have you involved. No specific questions are necessary right now, but if you notice any changes in her condition on the way to the clinic – such as worsening weakness, confusion, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please let me know immediately. For now, it’s best to avoid any strenuous activity or stressful situations. And definitely no driving. I’ll meet you both at the clinic as soon as possible. We’ll get the scans scheduled and get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: “No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Lahn. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and being so thorough. We’ll be there as soon as we can. Thank you again.” “Okay, Mom, I'm on my way! Just relax and try not to worry, okay? I'll be there in about twenty minutes.” “I’m so glad she's being so proactive. She just doesn't like to make a fuss.”
DOCTOR: "That’s wonderful, Sarah. It's good to have you involved. And you're right, your mother is very stoic. We'll take excellent care of her. In the meantime, let’s get her comfortable and prepare for the scans. I'll have a nurse come in to get her set up." “Just relax, Ms. Tofani. We’ll get through this together. I’ll be back in a few minutes. Do you need anything before I go?
