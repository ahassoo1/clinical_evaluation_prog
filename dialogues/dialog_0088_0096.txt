DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it’s about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. It feels like my skin is extra sensitive, you know? Like even just a little bit of sunshine feels…intense. It started a few months ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. Sensitive to the sun… and it started a few months ago. Can you tell me a bit more about that “intense” feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not exactly painful, not at first. More like… a burning sensation, especially on my face and arms. And then it gets really red. Like a sunburn, but I haven’t actually been sunburned recently. It just happens with regular exposure, even on cloudy days sometimes. It’s… weird. I used to be able to be out in the sun all day, no problem. It’s really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Alright, a burning sensation and redness with regular exposure, even on cloudy days. And this is a change from what you’re used to. Have you noticed any blisters, itching, or peeling skin along with the redness?
PATIENT: No blisters, thankfully. And it doesn’t really itch, not usually. Sometimes it feels a little dry afterwards, and the skin can get a bit flaky, especially on my nose and cheeks. But mostly just the redness and that burning feeling when I’m out. It's… frustrating, to be honest. I used to enjoy gardening so much. I'm having to be so careful now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blisters or itching, just redness, burning, and some dryness and flakiness afterward. That’s helpful. Now, have you been using any new soaps, lotions, or sunscreens recently?
PATIENT: Good question. Let me think… I did switch to a new laundry detergent about… three months ago? It's supposed to be for sensitive skin, actually. It's called "Gentle Bloom," I think. Other than that, no, not really. I've always used the same face wash and haven't started using any new lotions or anything. I usually try to stay out of the sun when I can, but I do use sunscreen when I have to be out. A regular one, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a new laundry detergent three months ago. That’s good to know. And you’re using regular sunscreen. Do you remember the SPF number on that sunscreen?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… I think it's SPF 30? Yeah, SPF 30. It's the one my wife used to buy, and I just kept getting the same one after… well, you know. It’s a spray, easy to apply. I try to put it on about 20 minutes before going outside, and I reapply if I’m out for a long time, but… honestly, it doesn't seem to be helping much lately. That’s part of what worried me enough to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, SPF 30, applied before and reapplied when out for long periods, but it doesn’t seem to be as effective as it used to be. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, never. My skin's always been pretty normal, honestly. No eczema, no psoriasis, nothing like that. I did have a bad case of poison ivy when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, I've always been pretty healthy. I’ve got high blood pressure, but I take medication for that. And, well… my wife passed away last year. But aside from that, nothing major medically.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Arbin. That must be incredibly difficult. Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and no history of skin conditions. Do you take any other medications besides the one for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It's… still hard. But I'm managing. No, just the one for blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And a daily vitamin, but that’s it. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills unless I have to. I try to eat healthy, get some exercise when I can, you know? Just trying to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a daily vitamin. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always said I was lucky that way. I can eat anything, take most pills without issue. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I think I’m pretty safe on that front. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of skin cancer or any unusual skin conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother had some moles she had removed when she was older, but I don’t think they were anything serious. Just regular mole removals, the doctor said. And my father… he had pretty normal skin too, as far as I can remember. He passed away a long time ago, so I don’t really know much about his medical history beyond that. No one that I know of had skin cancer, though. My sister is still alive, and she hasn't had any problems either. So, not that I'm aware of, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of skin cancer. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to take a look at the affected areas. Could you please remove your shirt and shorts so I can examine your skin?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s fine. Just let me know if you see anything concerning, alright? I'm a little self-conscious, but I understand it's necessary. This is just… strange, this whole thing with my skin. I’ve never had problems like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. Let's take a look. Okay, I see some redness on your face and arms, particularly after exposure to the sun. Your skin feels a bit dry to the touch. I’m not seeing any open sores, blisters, or unusual moles at this time. Do you notice any itching or burning anywhere specifically when I touch it?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t hurt when you touch it, just feels… warm, maybe? And a little sensitive. It’s more noticeable when the sun hits it, definitely. Like, right now, it feels okay, but I can tell it’s a little tender. And, now that you mention it, it does feel a little rougher on my cheeks and nose. It's hard to describe… just not smooth like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness with sun exposure and roughness on your cheeks and nose. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing photosensitivity – increased sensitivity to the sun. There are several possibilities, ranging from a reaction to the new laundry detergent, to a medication side effect, or even a more underlying condition. Given your history, I'm leaning towards a possible irritant contact dermatitis – a skin reaction to something you've come into contact with. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with a patch test to rule out an allergic reaction to the detergent, and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Tests sound good, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Patch test for the detergent… that makes sense. And a blood test… alright, yeah, let’s do it. I’d feel better knowing for sure. Is it going to be a painful blood draw? I don't really like needles. But honestly, if it helps figure this out, I’m willing. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. No, the blood draw won’t be painful, just a quick pinch. We’ll just need a small sample. And the patch test is also painless – we’ll apply a small amount of the detergent to your skin for a few days, and then see if there's a reaction. I’ll write up the orders for the lab now. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding the new detergent if possible, and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50 or higher, applying it liberally 20-30 minutes before sun exposure, and reapplying every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. Also, try to wear protective clothing, like a hat and long sleeves, when you're out in the sun. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: SPF 50… okay, I can do that. And avoid the detergent, definitely. Long sleeves and a hat… yeah, that makes sense. No, I think I understand. So, just try to stay out of the sun as much as possible, and use the stronger sunscreen and protective clothing, and we'll see what the tests show. And… I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, right? How long usually does it take to get those back? I’m hoping it’s nothing serious. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. That’s right – try to minimize sun exposure, use SPF 50, and wear protective clothing. The lab results usually take about 5-7 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you a week from today. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening of your symptoms – like blisters, severe pain, or a fever – please call the office immediately. I'm not going to prescribe anything at this point, as we need to determine the cause of the photosensitivity first. We want to avoid treating symptoms without knowing the underlying problem. Does that all sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, 5-7 days for the results, call if it gets worse… no medication yet. That sounds sensible. I appreciate you not wanting to just throw things at it without knowing what's going on. Yes, that all sounds good. Thank you, Doctor Piet. I feel a little better just having a plan. I guess I’ll head home and start avoiding that detergent. Hopefully, that’s all it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbin. You're very welcome. I understand it can be unsettling when something new comes up. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab orders and schedule your follow-up. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day, and try to relax.
