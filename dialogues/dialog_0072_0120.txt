DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 43 years old. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I don’t really have time for a lot of chatting. It's about getting pregnant. I just… want it to work, you know? My husband… well, he passed, and I want a child. Before it's too late. Is that what you need to know? I don't want any trouble, or a long process.
DOCTOR: I understand you're wanting to explore options for pregnancy, and that you're hoping for a straightforward process. It’s certainly understandable given your circumstances, Ms. Villarreal. However, achieving a pregnancy, even under ideal circumstances, often requires some investigation. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, it’s… a blur. I was generally healthy. Regular checkups, I think. Nothing major. My husband always handled the appointments, the details… all of it. It was years ago. I don't even remember the names of my doctors. Does that matter? I just want to know if I can still have a baby. Not a whole life story.
DOCTOR: While a detailed history is preferable, we can certainly work with what you recall. The fact that you generally experienced good health is a good starting point. However, given the time that has passed, and to assess your current ability to conceive, we will need to perform some basic tests. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies… probably not? I don’t really… take much. Penicillin, maybe? My mother always said I reacted to that as a child, but honestly, I've never paid much attention. And it was a long time ago. Look, is this going to take all day? I have things to do. Just tell me if I'm too old or if something is wrong with me, okay? I just want a yes or no.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration, but I cannot provide a definitive "yes" or "no" without proper evaluation. Saying whether or not you can conceive without any testing would be irresponsible. Regarding penicillin, it's helpful to know even if it was a childhood reaction. We’ll make a note of that. To begin, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam?! Look, I really don’t like the sound of that. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't we just do bloodwork or something? I don't... I haven't been with anyone since my husband passed, and frankly, I'm not comfortable with a stranger poking around down there. Is there anything else we can do first? I'm paying for this, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your discomfort, and I assure you, I approach these examinations with the utmost respect and sensitivity. However, a pelvic exam is a crucial first step in assessing your reproductive health. It allows me to evaluate the condition of your uterus, ovaries, and cervix, and to identify any potential issues that could affect your ability to conceive. While bloodwork is also necessary, it cannot provide the same level of information as a physical exam. It's essential for me to have a complete picture of your health before recommending any further steps. We can, of course, discuss this further. However, I must emphasize that proceeding without a pelvic exam would limit my ability to provide you with accurate and informed advice. Are you open to discussing any concerns you have specifically about the exam itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But be quick, okay? And explain everything before you do it. I don't want any surprises. Honestly, it's just… embarrassing. I haven’t had anyone touch me like that in years. Just… please be professional. And gentle. Is that too much to ask? I'm already stressed enough as it is. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. I will explain each step before I perform it, and you are free to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, I’ll have you lie on your back on the examination table, with your feet in stirrups. I'll begin with a visual external examination. Then, I will gently insert a speculum to allow me to visualize your cervix. This may cause some mild pressure, but should not be painful. Finally, I will perform a bimanual exam, using my hands to feel your uterus and ovaries. Would you like me to have a nurse present during the exam?
PATIENT: A nurse? Honestly, no. That's just... more people. I just want it done. The faster the better. Just… please don’t talk too much. I’m not really in the mood for chatting. And try to be quick. I have a feeling this is going to take all day already. Just get it over with, okay?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I will proceed with the examination. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point, and as I said, you may stop me at any time. I’m going to have you lie back on your back with your feet in the stirrups. I’ll just be explaining each step as I go, alright?
