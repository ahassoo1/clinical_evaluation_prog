DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, you know, keepin' up with things. Routine stuff. It’s good to see you, by the way. Been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine vaccinations. Good. It has been a while, according to your chart – last visit was…2018. We’ll definitely get you updated. Before we jump into that, though, can you tell me if anything specifically prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really prompted, no. My husband, Earl, was reminding me. He’s good about that sort of thing. I just figured it was time, you know? Haven’t been sick or anything, thankfully. Just tryin' to be responsible. Is there a new one I should be gettin'? I always forget which ones are which.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Ms. Fornes, and Earl sounds like a good man. Okay, let’s review what’s due. Based on your age and history, you're likely due for a Tdap booster, a flu shot – it's a little early in the season, but we can discuss timing – and a pneumococcal vaccine. Have you had those previously, do you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those names… I think I had a flu shot a few years back, maybe when my grandkids were little, trying to protect them. Pneumo…sounds familiar, but I honestly can't remember. And Tdap… that’s the one for…tetanus, right? I had that when I was younger, I'm pretty sure. It was a long time ago though, so I wouldn't swear on it. Sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be!
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Fornes. It's very common. Let's just check the chart here… Okay, it looks like you had a Tdap in 2008, and a pneumococcal vaccine in 2012. That means you are due for both boosters. To be certain, though, and before we administer anything, I'd like to ask a few quick questions. Have you ever had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not to a shot, not to anything, really. I get a little soreness sometimes, a bit of a fever, but nothing bad. Nothing I couldn’t handle. Earl always says I’m tougher than I look.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently experiencing any symptoms – fever, cough, unusual aches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, not a thing. Feelin' pretty good, all things considered. Just a little tired, but that’s just life, you know? Been helpin' Earl with the garden, it's a lot of work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. It sounds like you’re a good candidate for both updates. We'll do the Tdap and the pneumococcal vaccine today. Before we proceed, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I guess. Just…what can I expect afterwards? Will I be really achy? I'd like to be able to help Earl with dinner tonight. And, is there anything bad I should be lookin' out for? Just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Those are good questions. You may experience some soreness at the injection site – that's very common and usually resolves within a day or two. Mild fatigue, a low-grade fever, or some muscle aches are also possible, but generally shouldn’t be severe. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help manage those symptoms. However, it’s important to seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs of a severe allergic reaction – difficulty breathing, hives, swelling of the face or throat, dizziness. Those are rare, but it’s always best to be cautious. I'll also give you information sheets with more detailed instructions. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you, Doctor. That’s a relief to hear. I always worry a little with shots, but you make it sound manageable. Alright, let's get it done then, shall we? I appreciate you explainin' it so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with the Tdap then. Just a little pinch. Relax your arm… Okay. There you go. All done. Now for the pneumococcal… same thing, just in the other arm. And that’s the second one. You’ve been very brave, Ms. Fornes. We'll have you sit for about fifteen minutes just to monitor for any immediate reactions. Do you feel alright so far?
PATIENT: Yep, feelin' alright. Just a little pinch, like you said. Not bad at all. Both arms feel a bit…warm, maybe? But that’s probably just me worryin’. Fifteen minutes is no problem, gives me a chance to rest my arms. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Good. We'll keep an eye on you. Just let me or the nurse know if anything changes—if you develop any dizziness, shortness of breath, or swelling. While we're waiting, are you up-to-date on your annual flu shot?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I always forget about that one too! I think I got one last year, maybe at the grocery store? I don't remember exactly. It was one of those drive-thru things. Does it matter if it was at the grocery store?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't matter where you got it, as long as you received it. However, the flu virus changes yearly, so it's important to get it every year. It's recommended to get it in the fall, usually around October or November. Since today is August 2nd, it's a little early, but we can schedule an appointment now to ensure you don’t forget. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: That’s a good idea, actually. Get it out of the way. I always forget when it gets to be October, so scheduling it now is smart. Yes, please, let's schedule it. I'd rather be safe than sorry, you know? Earl would be glad to hear I’m takin' care of myself.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let me see… how about October 15th?
PATIENT: October 15th sounds perfect. That gives me plenty of time to recover from these shots, too. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a real help today.
DOCTOR: Alright, October 15th it is. I've added it to your chart and sent you a confirmation text. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Fornes?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience. And for remindin' me about all these important things! I'll see you in October.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself and Earl, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day.
