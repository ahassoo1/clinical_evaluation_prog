DOCTOR: Hi Henry, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor… Rosanova, yes? Just…chest feel funny. And heart…beat too fast sometimes. Old man problems, you know? Blood pressure…nurse already check, very high she say. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Henry, I understand. "Chest feel funny" and a fast heartbeat…and the nurse did mention your blood pressure was high. We'll get to the bottom of things as quickly as we can. When you say "funny," can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe? Like…tight. Not always tight, just…comes and goes. Like someone sitting on my chest, maybe. Not good feeling. I don’t know! It’s chest pain, okay? What do you want from me, a poem? I no good at describing feelings. Just…hurts sometimes.
DOCTOR: No poem needed, Henry, definitely not! "Tightness" that comes and goes, like pressure…that's helpful. And it does sound concerning. Does anything specifically trigger this tightness?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like…make it happen? No. It just…happens. Sometimes when I walk up hill, maybe? But I walk up hill every day. Sometimes when I angry, maybe. My wife, she make me angry sometimes, you know? But it’s not like every time I angry, I get pain. Just…random. It’s old man body, okay? Things just…break.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to happen with exertion, like walking uphill, and sometimes with strong emotions, but not consistently. We'll definitely investigate. Now, aside from this chest tightness and fast heartbeat, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I…tired. Very tired. Old man tired, you know? And…sometimes little dizzy. Not fall down dizzy, just…woozy. And…maybe little short breath. When I climb stairs, definitely. But…everyone gets short breath when old, right? It’s not…important.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, occasional dizziness, and shortness of breath with stairs… those are important things to tell me, Henry, even if they seem normal for your age. Let’s get a better picture of this. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm…let me see. …Maybe a little. Not much. My wife say I should wear…support socks, yes. But I no like socks. They too tight! Maybe little puffy. Not big puffy, just…normal puffy. Old man feet. Everything puffy when old. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Henry. A little swelling in the feet…that’s good information. Now, have you been having any coughing?
PATIENT: Coughing? Not much. A little…sometimes. Especially when I lie down flat. Like…something tickle back of my throat. Not bad cough, just…annoying. My wife say I snore. Maybe it’s that? I don’t know! Just little cough, okay? You asking too many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little cough when lying down. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…diagnosed… …Doctor told me my blood pressure high, yes. Many years ago. Take pill for it. Sometimes I forget. Wife yell at me. And…I think I had…arthritis, maybe? In my knees. Very painful. Old man problems. That's it! No…I had…something with my heart once. Long time ago. I think. I forget. Old man brain. Not good memory.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, arthritis in your knees, and something with your heart a long time ago… We’ll try to get more details on that heart issue, if possible. Do you remember what that heart issue was, or roughly when it happened?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I forget. Many years ago. Doctor…give me test. Something with…wires and…sticky things on my chest. And…pictures. Machine make pictures. That's all I remember! It was…not serious, I think. Otherwise, I would be dead already, yes? My wife would not yell at me so much. Just…old man heart. I no worry about it. It was long time ago. Can we finish now? I have appointment with my barber. Very important appointment!
DOCTOR: Alright, Henry, I understand your frustration. Wires and sticky things on your chest, pictures taken…that sounds like an EKG and possibly a chest X-ray. I’ll make a note to check for those records. Just a few more quick questions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? …Let me see… Ah! Yes. Appendix. When I was young. Very sick. They cut me open. Very scary. And… I think I had something on my eye. Small thing. They…fixed it. Small surgery. That’s it! Nothing big. Just little things. Now can we please finish? Barber very busy man. He no wait forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and something on your eye. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… …Blood pressure pill, yes. Sometimes I take…white pill for my knee. When it hurts very bad. And… sometimes I take…something for my stomach. When I eat spicy food. My wife give me. I no know the name. Too many pills! I forget what I take already. Just…pills. You want me to list every pill I ever take? That is too much work! Can we just finish now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Henry, I understand. We'll try to get a more accurate list from your pharmacy. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No! I eat everything. Spicy food, everything! No allergies. My wife try to give me something for…hay fever, maybe? But I no like it. Make me sleepy. So I no take it. No allergies! I am strong Korean man! I eat everything, I no fear anything! Now can we finally be done? This is wasting my time! Barber! Very important! .
DOCTOR: Alright, Henry. No known allergies. Okay, I think I have enough information for now. Let me just do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure again. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and I hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound a little congested, but not dramatically. Blood pressure is still elevated, 160/90. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this chest pain, fast heartbeat, and shortness of breath further. I'm going to order an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work to check your heart enzymes, cholesterol, and kidney function.
