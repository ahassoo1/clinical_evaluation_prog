DOCTOR: Hi Lytisha, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, they told me I needed to come in for… a check, I guess? Something about making sure I'm okay with… things. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something about a test, I think? My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. It sounds like this might be a routine check-up, possibly with some standard screenings. That's perfectly normal. And don’t worry about the memory part – it happens to the best of us! Let me just pull up your record here… Ah, yes. It looks like we scheduled you for a comprehensive wellness exam, including blood work and a basic physical. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit more about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Lately… well, work’s been… work. You know, paving. Lots of hot asphalt and early mornings. I've been feeling… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And achy. But I’m 51, so… that’s probably just getting old, right? I don’t really… do much else these days. Just work, and… try to keep the house tidy. I'm a widow, you see. Been a few years now.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It takes a lot of strength to keep going after something like that. And yes, work like paving is incredibly physically demanding. It’s good you’re aware of how it affects you. When you say tired, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not… like, falling-down exhausted. Just… everything feels like it takes more effort. Like getting out of bed in the morning is a real chore. And I find myself… dozing off in the evenings, watching TV. Which I don't usually do. It’s just… a heaviness, I guess. Not a sharp tiredness, just… worn out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lytisha. That sounds like it could be a few different things, and it's good you're paying attention to it. Okay, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems – in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… the one before Dr. Maskal… said my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago. He put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. I didn't like taking pills. And… I think I had something with my back once, from all the lifting at work. But that was ages ago. Nothing serious, really. Mostly just aches and pains. Oh, and… my knees aren't what they used to be. Is that something I need to tell you?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do! All of that is helpful. High blood pressure, even if it was a while ago, is important to know. And the back and knee issues – absolutely. Do you remember the name of the medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no, I don’t. It was a little white pill, I think. Small one. They all look the same to me. I really don’t remember the name. I just remember not liking taking it every day. It made me feel… funny sometimes. That’s why I stopped. I probably shouldn’t have, but… well, I didn’t. My head wasn’t clear, if that makes sense. Like a bit dizzy. Is it bad that I stopped?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, it happens. It's not ideal to stop medication without talking to a doctor, but it sounds like you had a reaction you didn't like, and that's important to know. The dizziness is something we’ll definitely want to look into. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I do take something for my knees, sometimes. It’s an ibuprofen, I think. The white bottle. When they really bother me. Not every day, just when I’ve been working hard. And… sometimes a little something for headaches. But not often. Just when they get really bad. Is that okay? I don’t take much, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees and something for headaches when needed. That’s good to know. And how often would you say you take the ibuprofen, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often. Maybe… two or three times a month? When I’ve had a really long shift at work, or if it’s been raining and the cold gets into my bones. It's hard to say exactly. Some months I don't take any at all. It just depends. I try not to take too much, because I know it's not good for you. Is that too much? I always worry I'm doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re being very mindful of your medication use, which is great. Two or three times a month is likely fine, but we'll keep it in mind. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... You know, I don't think so. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I used to think I was allergic to cats, because my eyes would water when I was around them. But my sister said it was just the dust. So, probably not. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and nothing’s ever bothered me. I do get itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. At least, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, family history… Well, my mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he had something with his stomach. But I don't really remember much about it. It was a long time ago. And my brother… he was healthy as a horse, always running around. I don't think anyone else had any… serious illnesses. Mostly just aches and pains, like the rest of us. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. It's hard for me to remember details. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lytisha. It’s common to not have a full picture of family history, especially as time goes on. Knowing your mother had heart trouble is helpful, and that’s a good starting point. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… I used to drink a little, when my husband was alive. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I haven't had a drink in years. Not since… well, since he passed away. And I’ve never smoked. Never liked the smell of it. As for… other things… I don't really… do much of that. Not anymore. Not since I retired. My life is pretty simple these days. Work and home, mostly. That’s all. It's why they sent me for this test, isn't it? To check if I'm doing alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no current alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. That’s good to know. It sounds like you’ve made some healthy choices. And yes, this check-up is to make sure everything is alright, and to rule out anything that might be causing your tiredness. Alright, Lytisha, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me if it’s going to hurt. I've never been one for fuss, so just get on with it. I’d like to get this over with, if that's alright. I've got to get back to work, you know. They need me to finish paving that parking lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It won't hurt, but I may need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. We'll also do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. … 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. It can fluctuate depending on stress and activity. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… and again… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lower lungs. It could be due to a number of things, like mild congestion.
PATIENT: Oh… crackling, you say? Is that bad? I haven't been feeling sick, not really. Just tired, like I said. Is it my lungs? I used to work around a lot of dust, when I first started paving. All sorts of things floating around in the air. Maybe it’s that? It’s been years, though. Years and years. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I need to be able to work, you know. I'm the only one who can operate that machine properly.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the dust exposure. That’s definitely relevant. Crackling can sometimes indicate fluid in the lungs, or some inflammation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back, and I’ll gently press on your belly. Let me know if anything feels tender. Anything here bother you?
PATIENT: No… not really. It’s a little… tight, maybe? I’ve been eating a lot of comfort food lately. Been feeling down, you know. But not painful. Just… a bit uncomfortable. Like I’m bloated, maybe? It happens sometimes. It’s probably just gas. I get gas a lot. My husband always used to joke about it. It's nothing, Doctor. Really. Just an old lady’s stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, I do feel some slight fullness, but nothing concerning at this time. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. I'm just going to test your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but not drastically so. It could be normal for your age, but we will keep it in mind. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and orientation. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… It’s… 2025, isn’t it? August? Yes, August 2nd. My niece told me. She always keeps track of things. I used to be good with dates, but… it’s all a bit fuzzy these days. Is that… is that wrong? Am I losing my mind? It's just… the years all blur together sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, that is absolutely correct! You remembered the year and the date perfectly. And it’s perfectly normal for memory to become a little less sharp as we get older. It doesn’t mean you’re losing your mind at all. Okay, Lytisha, I’ve completed the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found, I’d like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and check for any underlying infections or deficiencies. The chest X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I can’t keep feeling tired all the time. I need to be able to work. So, blood work and a chest X-ray… alright. When do I need to come back? And where do I go? I don’t drive anymore, so I'll need someone to take me. I can ask my niece, she’s always willing to help. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll write you a referral for the blood work and chest X-ray. You can go to the lab at the hospital, just a few blocks down. They’ll take a sample of your blood, and the radiologist will take some images of your chest. The results should be back in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. And try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… nice to have someone understand. I’ll go ask my niece to take me to the lab. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lytisha. It was my pleasure. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Goodbye, and I’ll see you soon.
