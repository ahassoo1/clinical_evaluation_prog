DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It's about time someone got around to seeing me. My foot, dear. It’s just…awful. A sore, really. Been bothering me for weeks now. Though, I doubt you understand what weeks truly feels like at your age. It's a diabetic thing, I suppose. Though I've managed perfectly well on my own for decades.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for quite some time. And you're right to consider diabetes as a potential cause – it can certainly affect the feet. We’ll get to the bottom of it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a sore, Doctor. It’s a…a hole, practically. Right on the bottom of my foot. It's been weeping, and it smells. Not pleasant, I assure you. I’ve tried everything, really. Salves, bandages…even some traditional remedies my grandmother used. Nothing seems to help. It's just getting worse, and frankly, I don't have time for this. I have important research to oversee, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. A weeping sore on the bottom of your foot… and it hasn’t improved with home treatments. That sounds concerning. Do you recall how it started?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. It just…appeared. Probably stepped on something, I suppose. Though I always wear shoes, proper leather ones, mind you. Not like these youngsters running around barefoot. It wasn’t a dramatic event, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…there. One day, a little red spot, the next, this mess. It's not like I spend my days examining every inch of my feet, I have important things to do! But it’s gotten bigger, and now it’s…well, you’ll see, I presume.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for these things to develop gradually. And you're right, it's not always easy to notice right away. Would you mind if I took a look at your foot?
PATIENT: Well, obviously. That's what I came here for, isn’t it? But be gentle, dear. I haven't got all day. And please, have a clean pair of gloves. I don't need any of your…common ailments.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, have a seat and I'll take a look. I’m going to gently examine your foot, and I'll ask you some questions as I do. It does appear to be quite deep, and there's some inflammation. Can you tell me if you've noticed any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Goodness, that’s cold! And don't poke so much! Honestly. Fever? Chills? No. I don't get fevers. I have a very strong constitution, thank you very much. I might have felt a little…warm a few nights ago, but that was probably just the humidity. This weather is dreadful. Besides, I wouldn’t bother a doctor over a little shiver. I've faced far worse during my expeditions. This is…inconvenient, that’s what it is. A small setback. Don't make a mountain out of a molehill, Doctor. Now, what are you going to do about it? I expect results.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you haven’t had any systemic symptoms like fever or chills, which is good. Based on what you’ve described and the examination, this wound is concerning, and given your history of diabetes, it's important we take it seriously. It’s possible this could be an infection, and infections in the feet can become serious very quickly. To be certain, I'd like to order some tests. A wound culture to identify any bacteria present, and a blood test to check for signs of infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, of course. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Honestly, the indignity of it all! Fine. Do whatever tests you deem necessary. But I expect a swift turnaround. I don't have time to sit around waiting for results. And explain everything clearly, Doctor. I won't tolerate medical jargon. And I want to know what this means. Is it serious? Will I be able to continue my research? I have a schedule to keep, you know. This is all very…disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I’ll do my best to expedite the testing process. We'll get the results as quickly as possible, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. The tests will help us determine if there's an infection and what type of bacteria is present, if any. This will guide our treatment plan. While we don't know the severity yet, it’s important to address this promptly to prevent complications. We’ll know more once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the wound clean and dry, and avoiding putting weight on your foot as much as possible. I'm also going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Medical history? Really? What exactly do you need to know? I've been perfectly healthy my entire life, despite everything. Though I suppose you’ll want to know about the diabetes. Diagnosed…oh, decades ago. Not a big deal, really. Managed it perfectly well on my own for years. I haven't been to a doctor regularly. Waste of time, in my opinion. But ask away. Just don’t expect detailed answers. I have a terrible memory for dates and…precise measurements. And don’t ask about my travels. That’s private.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’ve been managing your diabetes well on your own. Knowing that gives us a good starting point. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… There was that one time, a very long time ago, during an expedition. Something with my appendix, I believe. Very primitive conditions. They barely had any proper equipment. It was quite an ordeal, actually. But I recovered quickly, of course. I’m a very resilient person. And that was… decades ago. I haven't needed anything since. Mostly just minor scrapes and bruises. Nothing serious. Are you going to ask me about every single scratch I've ever gotten? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No, just trying to get a complete picture. And you're right, we don’t need to detail every minor injury. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I've taken all sorts of medications during my travels. Antimalarials, antibiotics… you name it. I haven’t got time to be delicate. I've built up an immunity to practically everything. Though, I did have a slight reaction to a penicillin derivative once, a very long time ago. A minor rash, nothing serious. But I avoided penicillin after that. Just to be safe. Are we nearly done? I have important work to get back to, you know. This is a complete waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And yes, we're almost finished. Just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently take any medications on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I told you. I manage my diabetes perfectly well on my own. A little diet, a little exercise, that's all it takes. No need for fancy pills or injections. I don't believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. Though, admittedly, they haven't been very effective on this…wound. But no, I don’t take any medications on a regular basis. And I intend to keep it that way. Now, are we finally finished? I need to get back to my research. This is all quite tiresome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Louine. We've covered a lot. Just to recap, we've discussed your wound, your history of diabetes, a past appendectomy, a penicillin allergy, and that you don't take any regular medications. I've ordered a wound culture and blood tests to check for infection. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, please keep the wound clean and dry, and try to avoid putting weight on your foot as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, Doctor, I think I should be asking the questions. But very well. When can I expect these…results? And what happens if it is an infection? Will I need to be hospitalized? I have a very busy schedule, you know. I can’t simply disappear for weeks on end. And what about my research? Who will oversee it in my absence? Honestly, the thought of it… It’s all very unsettling. And one more thing. Are you sure you’ve taken all the necessary precautions to avoid cross-contamination? I wouldn’t want to catch anything from your clinic. It looks rather…common.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Louine. Let me address them one by one. The results should be back within 48 to 72 hours. I’ll have my staff contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. If it is an infection, the treatment will depend on the severity and the type of bacteria. In most cases, it can be managed with oral antibiotics, and hospitalization would likely not be necessary. We’ll discuss all the options and create a plan that works best for you. As for your research, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, I can’t advise you on who to delegate responsibilities to. However, I can provide a note for your colleagues, outlining your medical condition and any limitations you may have. And finally, please rest assured that we adhere to the strictest hygiene standards. We take every precaution to prevent cross-contamination. Your health and safety are our top priority. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: A note, you say? Hmm. That will have to do, I suppose. And oral antibiotics… acceptable. Though I prefer natural remedies, whenever possible. No. I think that is all. Just…get those results quickly, Doctor. And please, don’t bother me with unnecessary details. I have important work to do. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Louine. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with your research. .
