DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just wanted to ask if you could maybe write me a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card or something encouraging. My daughter thinks I need… bolstering. She worries too much. It’s not like I’m sick sick. Just… feeling a bit low, I suppose. And a card from a real doctor would mean a lot to her.
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! Is that so strange? She says I don’t take care of myself. All this working, you know? It’s tiring, assembling all those… things. She thinks a little note from you saying I should rest would finally get her off my back. Honestly, she treats me like I’m made of glass. A strong woman like me.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Micucci, while I appreciate your daughter’s concern, my time is dedicated to addressing medical issues. I’m a doctor, not a… morale booster. However, since you’ve come in, let’s at least go over what “feeling low” means. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, really? A doctor can’t write a little card these days? Back home, the doctor would visit just to check on your spirits! It’s all about the whole person, you know. But fine, fine. "Feeling low"... well, I’m just tired, mostly. And a little achy. My hands, you know? From the assembly work. It’s not a complaint, exactly. Just… life. I don’t have time for aches and pains. Things need doing. But she worries. She says I need to “prioritize my health.” As if I don't know my own body.
DOCTOR: "Assembly work?
PATIENT: Yes, assembly! Little gadgets, mostly. Electronic things. I work at the factory, over on Elm Street. It’s… repetitive. Lots of small parts. Very precise. It’s good work, keeps me busy. I put things together. It’s useful. But, like I said, it's tiring on the hands. And sometimes, I just feel... worn out. It's not like I'm asking for special treatment, Doctor. Just explaining why my daughter is fussing. Though, frankly, I think she's making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been doing this assembly work, Ms. Micucci?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me think. It’ll be… fifteen years, next spring, I believe. Fifteen years! It’s a steady job, you see? Good benefits, steady hours. I started when my daughter… well, never you mind. It’s been fifteen years, and I've never had any trouble. Just a little tiredness lately, that’s all. Honestly, I think a good cup of tea would solve most of it. But she insists on doctors and… cards. It’s a fuss, that's what it is.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years of repetitive hand motions. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: Numbness? Oh, sometimes, a little. Mostly at the end of the day, when I've been working for a long stretch. It goes away with a bit of rest, you know? Just… tired fingers. Nothing serious. I wouldn’t be able to do my job if it was serious, would I? And I do my job, very well. It’s not like I’m dropping things all the time. A little tingle here and there is just… part of life, Doctor. You wouldn't expect a dancer to never have sore feet, would you?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. Let's just take a look. Extend your arms like this... now clench your fists tightly... and relax. Any pain or discomfort with that?
PATIENT: A little ache, yes. Just in the wrists. Not sharp, not terrible. More of a… weariness. Like I said, it goes away with a rest. Honestly, I’m probably making a fuss over nothing. She’ll be thrilled if you tell her I needed an exam. It validates her worrying, you see? There. That's a little uncomfortable, but not something to write a card about, surely?
DOCTOR: I see. And what about this hand?
PATIENT: It’s the same, really. A little ache. The same weariness. Honestly, Doctor, I've been doing this for fifteen years. A little ache in the wrists is to be expected, isn't it? I'm not a young woman anymore. Things creak a bit, you know? Though, I still get more done in a day than most people half my age. She just... worries.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. It appears you have some early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome in both wrists. It's not severe at this point, but it's likely contributing to the ache and weariness you're feeling. The repetitive motions of your assembly work are a likely cause.
PATIENT: Carpal... what now? Sounds awfully serious. And you’re blaming my work? My work is steady, honest work. I need that work. Is this going to mean I can't… assemble things anymore? Honestly, Doctor, I’m perfectly capable. A little ache doesn’t mean I need to… stop living my life. Is this what my daughter wanted? To get me off work? She's always been a worrier.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean you need to stop working, Ms. Micucci. But ignoring it could lead to more significant pain and weakness, potentially impacting your ability to do your job and other activities. We can try some conservative treatments first – wrist splints, exercises, and modifications to your workstation. We'll need to rule out other causes. And I'd like to discuss ergonomics with you to see if there are ways to lessen the strain on your wrists. The goal is to manage the symptoms and prevent them from worsening. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Splints? Exercises? Honestly, that sounds like a lot of fuss. And “ergonomics”? Is that like… rearranging things? It’s just… I don’t have time for all of that. I have things to do. I'm perfectly capable of managing my own body. I’ve been doing this for fifteen years, haven't I? And I need to be able to continue. My daughter… she'll be thrilled if she thinks I’m taking this seriously. But honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? Can’t I just… try some tea? And maybe a bit of rest?
DOCTOR: While tea and rest are certainly helpful, Ms. Micucci, they may not be enough to address the underlying problem. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some nerve conduction studies. This will help us determine the severity of the nerve compression and rule out other conditions. I’m also going to write you a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you proper exercises and workstation setup. I understand your concerns about time, but these tests and therapy are important steps in preventing further complications. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Nerve… studies? Sounds dreadful. And a physical therapist? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you’re trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. I'm perfectly fine. A little ache, a little weariness. It's just... life. Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything. But honestly, all this fuss is giving me a headache. I just wanted a card. A little “Get Well” card from a real doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand you’re frustrated, and I apologize if I’m not meeting your expectations. However, my responsibility is to address your health concerns, and ignoring these symptoms could lead to long-term complications. The nerve conduction studies are a simple, non-invasive test that will provide valuable information. And the physical therapist can teach you techniques to alleviate your pain and prevent further injury. I’m going to schedule you for the nerve conduction studies next week. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend that you take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and I’ll provide you with a handout on proper wrist positioning. Do you have any questions about the tests or the physical therapy?
PATIENT: Fine. Nerve… studies. Whatever. But I'm telling you, it's a waste of time. And if it interferes with my work, I’m holding you responsible. A handout? Wrist… positioning? Is that like yoga? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t got time for all this. Will this… card at least be a nice one? With flowers? My daughter likes flowers.
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction studies will take about an hour. We’ll arrange the appointment around your work schedule as much as possible. And the handout will provide simple exercises and tips on maintaining proper posture – it’s not yoga, just basic ergonomic principles. As for the card… I can’t guarantee flowers, Ms. Micucci, but I will write a note encouraging you to prioritize your health and take care of your wrists. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. A note… is better than nothing, I suppose. As long as it says something about resting. And not letting her fuss over me too much. Maybe you could mention how much I get done in a day? She always forgets how hard I work. Will that be all, Doctor? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Micucci, that will be all for today. I’ve noted your achievements on the referral form. The scheduler will contact you to arrange the nerve conduction studies. Please follow the instructions on the handout, and let me know if you have any questions. I wish you the best, and I hope you feel better soon. And remember… a little self-care can go a long way. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Wrist positioning… honestly. She'll be thrilled.
