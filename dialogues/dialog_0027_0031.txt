DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been botherin’ me a bit, and I remember the other doctor said somethin’ about my heart not beatin’ right sometimes. I think that's what he called it… atrial… somethin’? It’s that leg that's swollen, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, your left leg is swollen, and you mentioned some past concerns about your heart rhythm… atrial… fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the word! Atrial fibrillation. I don’t really understand it, mind you. Just that he said it could cause… problems. And now my leg is puffed up like a balloon, almost. It started a few days ago, I think. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and big.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the swelling started a few days ago, and it’s mostly uncomfortable, not painful. Has anything specific made it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve been tryin’ to keep it elevated, like my mum always said for sprains, but it doesn’t seem to be doin’ much. I’ve been walkin’ to and from school, as usual, though. I teach computer science, so I’m on my feet a fair bit. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It could matter, yes. Being on your feet a lot can sometimes worsen swelling. And you mentioned walking to and from school… is the swelling worse at the end of the day, after walking?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, aye, it is a bit worse in the evenin’. Not dramatically, but I definitely notice it more when I get home after a long day. It feels a bit… heavier, I suppose. And a bit more achy, maybe. Still not proper pain, just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the leg?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. It’s not red, and it doesn’t feel any warmer than my other leg. It just… is bigger. And feels a bit… tight, if that makes sense? Like my skin is stretched too far. It's a strange feelin’. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look at your leg, Nixon. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I’d appreciate it if you could. I’m not sure what to do about it, and it is worryin’ me a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just lie down on the table for me, please. I'm going to gently examine your leg and check a few things. First, I'll just feel for any tenderness and compare both legs. Now, tell me if anything feels particularly sore when I press here. And can you point to exactly where the swelling is most noticeable?
PATIENT: Right, aye. Here it is. It’s mostly around my calf, I think. And… it feels a bit tender here, if you press hard. Not a sharp pain, but… I can feel it. It’s sort of all over, really, but more concentrated around my calf muscle. I can feel it when I walk, too, a dull ache. It's… hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness in your calf, as you mentioned. And the pulses feel good and strong in both feet, which is reassuring. I’m also checking for any fluid retention. It does appear there's some swelling, and a little bit of fluid buildup. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine. Listen to my heart away, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. I just want to know what’s goin’ on, and what I should be doin’. I’ve got classes tomorrow, so I hope it’s not somethin’ serious that’ll keep me from teachin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Your heart… well, I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, which I’m not surprised about given your history of atrial fibrillation. It's not dramatically irregular at the moment, but it’s definitely present. I'm going to need to order an EKG to get a better look at your heart’s electrical activity. It’ll give us more information. I'm also going to order a D-dimer blood test to rule out a blood clot in your leg. That’s the most important thing to rule out right now, given the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An EKG and a blood test… aye, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. A blood clot… that sounds a bit scary. Is it… common, with this atrial… what was it again? Fibrillation? And how long will these tests take? I have to plan my classes, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions, Nixon. It's important to understand what's going on. A blood clot is a possibility, yes, but it's not necessarily common, and we're being proactive by ruling it out. The atrial fibrillation can increase your risk slightly, which is why we're taking it seriously. The EKG is quick – just a few minutes, right here in the office. The blood test will take a bit longer – results usually come back within a few hours, but can sometimes take up to 24 hours, depending on the lab. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your leg whenever possible, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. And if the swelling gets significantly worse, or you experience any pain, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Right, aye. Elevate my leg, avoid standin' too long, and emergency room if it gets worse. I can remember that. And you'll call me with the results of the tests. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a bit better, knowin' what's bein’ done. Is there… anything else I should be doin’? Or avoid?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. For now, just focus on those things. And try not to worry too much. We're taking all the necessary steps to figure out what’s going on. Since you have atrial fibrillation, it’s important to make sure you’re following up with a cardiologist regularly. Do you currently see one?
PATIENT: No, I don’t, actually. The other doctor just… told me about it, and said to keep an eye on it. He didn’t… refer me to anyone. He moved away shortly after, so I haven’t seen him since. I suppose I should have, but I’ve been so busy with teachin’.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Nixon. It's easy to let things slip, especially when you're busy. I'm going to write you a referral to a cardiologist. They will be able to assess your condition more thoroughly and determine the best course of treatment. It’s important to get this managed properly, as it can affect your risk of stroke. For now, we’ll focus on ruling out a blood clot, and then getting you established with a cardiologist. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've answered everything I was worryin’ about, and the referral is very helpful. Thank you very much for your time and help. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. I'll have the nurse print out the referral form and the instructions for the tests. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions later on. Take care, and I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And Nixon… try to get some rest. It does wonders. .
