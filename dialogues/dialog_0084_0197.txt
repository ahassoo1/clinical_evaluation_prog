DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just Sciarrotta is fine, please. I need to get a card… for driving, you know, for the ride-sharing. It’s a requirement now, I believe? I drive people around sometimes, and I want to be sure I’m doing everything properly. I don’t want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sciarrotta, that's perfectly fine. So, you need a medical evaluation for your ride-sharing driver’s license. I understand wanting to be compliant with all the regulations. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. To start, can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, my overall health… well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect, naturally. I have a little arthritis in my hands, mostly. It doesn’t bother me too much when I’m actually doing things. I get tired easier than I used to, but who doesn't? And my eyesight isn’t what it once was, I wear glasses. But I had my eyes checked just six months ago. Is that what you mean? I take a little medicine for high blood pressure, too. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Arthritis in your hands, some fatigue, glasses – checked six months ago, that’s good – and medication for high blood pressure. Let's get a bit more specific about that blood pressure medicine. Do you know the name of it and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. And the dosage… hmm. I believe it’s 20 milligrams. Yes, 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning. I’ve been on it for… oh, goodness, maybe ten years now? Something like that. My old doctor always kept track of everything, but he retired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily for about ten years. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten everything, tried everything, really. Never had a reaction. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. Nothing. I’m quite lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant illnesses… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. Maybe thirty years ago? I recovered fully. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago as well. That was… uneventful, if that makes sense. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, but there were no complications. Nothing else comes to mind. I broke my wrist when I was a child, but that was a long time ago and healed perfectly. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia about thirty years ago and gallbladder removal twenty years ago, both with full recovery. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… is there any history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or any other serious medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My father had heart disease. He had a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. And my mother had diabetes, towards the end of her life. She didn’t take care of herself very well, to be honest. My brother has high blood pressure, like me. And… that's about it, I think. No history of stroke, as far as I know. It wasn’t something we talked about much. Everyone kept to themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – heart disease in your father, diabetes in your mother, and high blood pressure in your brother. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked, but I always made him go outside. It smelled terrible. I always thought it was a foolish habit. I’ve always been very careful about my health, you see. Even when I was younger and didn’t necessarily feel careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two, on a special occasion. Nothing excessive. I don’t drink every day, not by a long shot. More like a couple of times a week. It helps me relax, you know? I don’t get drunk or anything. I’m a very moderate drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, a glass or two of wine a few times a week. Now, let's talk about how you've been feeling recently. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, vision changes, or anything else that's concerning you?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hands ache a little in the mornings, but that’s the arthritis. And sometimes, if I stand up too quickly, I get a little dizzy, but it passes. Nothing major. My vision is a little blurry when I take my glasses off, but that’s to be expected. I don’t have any shortness of breath, and I haven’t had any headaches or anything like that. I feel… normal, for a 70-year-old. If that makes sense. Honestly, I feel pretty good, all things considered. I came here because I want to be sure I can drive, not because I feel unable to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's reassuring to hear. Just to clarify, when you stand up quickly and feel dizzy, does it happen every time, or is it infrequent?
PATIENT: It's… infrequent. Not every time, definitely. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. And it doesn't last long, just a few seconds. I usually just hold onto something and it goes away. It’s not like I’m fainting or anything. It’s just a little… whoosh, you know? And then it's gone. I've had it for a while, honestly. It doesn't bother me too much. I figured it was just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, but I understand it's necessary. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that's not uncommon at your age. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Your gait is steady, but a little slower than average. Everything seems generally okay, Sciarrotta. Your exam is mostly normal for your age. However, that slightly elevated blood pressure and the occasional dizziness are things we should monitor. I recommend a repeat blood pressure check in a week. Do you have a home blood pressure monitor?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I never thought I'd need one. My old doctor always checked it when I went for my appointments. I suppose I should get one, though. If you think it's important. And the dizziness… I don’t think it’s anything serious, but I’m glad you listened to my heart. I just want to be sure I’m safe on the road, you know? For everyone’s sake. So, what does this mean for my card? Can I still get it?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk about that. Given the slightly elevated blood pressure and the occasional dizziness, I’m going to recommend a simple EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – just to make sure everything is okay with your heart. It's a quick and painless test. We can do it right here in the office. And I’d like to review your medication list with the pharmacy to ensure there are no interactions that could be contributing to the dizziness. As for the card, it depends on the results of those tests. I don't want to approve anything until I'm certain it's safe for you to drive. It’s my professional responsibility to ensure your health doesn’t pose a risk to yourself or others. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. I understand you need to be careful. I wouldn’t want to put anyone at risk. An EKG sounds fine. And checking the medications is a good idea, too. I’m happy to do whatever it takes. Just let me know when you’re ready, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get this sorted out so I can keep driving. It helps me stay active, you know? And I enjoy meeting people.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let's get the EKG done now. It will just involve placing some stickers on your chest and arms. It takes about five minutes. Once that’s complete, I’ll send the order to the pharmacy for the medication review. We should have the results within a day or two. I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let me know if it's going to be cold, or anything. I get easily chilled these days. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. Thank you for taking such good care of me.
