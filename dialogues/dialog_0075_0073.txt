DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s…well, it’s my stomach. Been having trouble with it for weeks now. Just…diarrhea. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll certainly try to be efficient. "Diarrhea for weeks" is a bit vague though, so let's get some specifics. When did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep a calendar of my bowel movements. It was…sometime after my anniversary. So, probably around the end of June? Look, is this really necessary? I just need something to stop it, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I do appreciate your honesty. And yes, getting to the root cause is important, even if it feels like a hassle right now. "Around the end of June" is helpful. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Ugh. What do you mean? It’s…watery. And frequent. And embarrassing. I don’t need to go into detail about that, do I? It’s not like it’s a pleasant experience. I just want to know what pill you’re going to give me to make it stop. I’ve already wasted enough time on this.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery and frequent. And you've been trying over-the-counter remedies without success. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No blood. No fever. No throwing up. Just…this. And it’s exhausting. I can barely leave the house, honestly. It’s been a real disruption. I’m a painter, you know? I need to be on the job, not stuck in the bathroom. I’m losing money, thanks to this. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood, no fever, no vomiting - that’s good to know. And I understand your frustration with it disrupting your work. To get a clearer picture, let’s talk about what you've been eating and drinking lately. Have there been any changes to your diet?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Salmon, rice, berries...you know, normal food. I haven't been eating anything weird. And I drink water, mostly. Look, I’m a fairly healthy person. This is just…a really annoying problem. Are we getting anywhere? I’m starting to feel like I’m just explaining the obvious.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fairly consistent diet…Salmon, rice, berries…Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? No. Not since…well, not since my husband passed. I haven't been on a vacation in years. I stay pretty close to home. This is ridiculous. Is this a standard procedure for every stomach issue? Asking a million questions about everything but the actual problem? I just want a solution, not a life story interview.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if it feels like I'm asking unnecessary questions. It’s important to rule out certain possibilities, even if they seem unlikely. I assure you, I am trying to get to a solution as quickly as possible. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can discuss some potential options. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or cramping with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Yes, cramping. A lot of it. Especially before…well, you know. And it’s been getting worse, actually. It’s not just uncomfortable, it’s…sharp. And it’s been making it hard to sleep. Honestly, it's been a nightmare. Are you finally going to do something about this, or are you just going to keep grilling me? I have paint to apply.
DOCTOR: Alright, cramping that's getting sharper and interfering with sleep. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. I really don’t have time for this. And please be gentle. I'm a painter, remember? My hands are important.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Sounds are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, just a bit of tenderness here on the left side. Not significantly distended. No masses felt. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a number of things, including a possible mild case of infectious colitis or even Irritable Bowel Syndrome. However, given the duration and the cramping, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a stool sample analysis to check for any bacteria, parasites, or viruses. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel to check for inflammation and dehydration.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You need my…that? This is humiliating. And blood work? Fine. Whatever. But if this takes too long, I'm not paying for it. And if it doesn't solve the problem, I expect a refund. I have a business to run, you know. Just…get it over with. And tell me where I need to go for these tests. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, these tests are standard procedure. The lab orders are right here. You’ll need to take these to the lab across the hall. They’ll give you instructions for collecting the stool sample. As for the blood work, you can do that at the same lab, or at any lab that accepts your insurance. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help slow down the diarrhea and provide some relief. It’s called Loperamide. Start with two capsules after your first loose stool, then one capsule after each subsequent loose stool, up to a maximum of eight capsules per day. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Fine. Loperamide. I’ll try it. But if it doesn’t work, I’m going to need something stronger. Look, I don’t have time for trial and error. I need a solution, and I need it now. Can I just get a copy of these orders, or are you going to make me memorize them? I really have to go.
DOCTOR: Here you are, a summary of everything we discussed - the medication dosage, the lab orders, and my contact information if you have any questions. I understand you're busy, Ms. Woodring. Please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the lab results. We'll review them together and determine the best course of action. I hope you feel better soon. If you don't improve within 48 hours, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I expect results.
