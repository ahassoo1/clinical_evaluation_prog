DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s nice to meet someone who actually looks like they know what they're doing, if you don’t mind my saying. I just need a little something from you, that’s all. A card. A “Get Well” card, or one of those encouraging ones. My daughter says it’ll cheer me up, but she doesn’t understand these things.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your…directness, Janeth. While I’m happy to try and help in any way I can, this clinic is a medical facility, and I’m a doctor. I provide medical care. Perhaps there’s a misunderstanding?
PATIENT: Misunderstanding? No, you’re misunderstanding. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I just want a card. From you. With your official doctor signature on it. It’s for… morale. You know, a little something to show my sister, who thinks I’m wasting my time coming to a real doctor for… this. It’s a matter of principle, really. A doctor’s card carries weight. Don’t tell me you can't write a simple card. It's not like you're performing surgery.
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand you're feeling frustrated and want to demonstrate something to your sister. However, providing a card solely for that purpose isn’t within the scope of medical practice. My signature carries legal and ethical responsibilities—it signifies a medical assessment and care. Writing a card in this instance would be misrepresenting that. Could you tell me a little more about why you felt you needed to come see a doctor today?
PATIENT: Oh, so now you’re getting all… legal on me? Honestly. It’s just a card! And it’s not like I haven't gone to doctors before. Just… never one who made it so difficult. Look, my daughter, bless her heart, she worries too much. She said I should get something official. Something to prove I'm taking care of myself. And a doctor's card… well, it just sounds more important, doesn't it? It's not about being sick, it's about… appearances. You wouldn’t understand. You’re too young, probably. Doctors these days... all about the rules.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to reassure your daughter and perhaps prove something to your sister. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like there's a bit of a family dynamic at play here. Just to be sure I'm understanding correctly, you came to the clinic specifically to obtain a card with my signature, not because you’re experiencing any health concerns?
PATIENT: Exactly! You’re finally getting it. No aches, no pains, no funny feelings. Just… a card. A simple, official-looking card with a doctor's name on it. Is that really so much to ask? My husband keeps saying I'm making a fuss over nothing, but he doesn't have to deal with my sister. She's always been critical. A card would shut her up nicely. Honestly, it's more for my peace of mind than anything. Though, a nice, fancy card would be appreciated. Do you have any with flowers?
DOCTOR: Janeth, I want to be respectful of your wishes, but I’m ethically obligated to provide medical care to patients who need it. Creating a document solely for the purpose of resolving a family disagreement, and especially one with my medical signature attached when there is no medical basis, would be a violation of those principles. I’m happy to talk with you about any health concerns you do have, and we can address those. Perhaps we could discuss preventative care, or a general wellness check?
PATIENT: Preventative care? Wellness check? What for? I told you, I'm perfectly fine! This isn’t about my health, it's about… principles. Honestly, it's like talking to a brick wall. You doctors all think you’re so important, so superior. You get paid to help people, don't you? Well, this is helping me! Helping me maintain my sanity. It's a small thing, a tiny favor. And you’re making it into some sort of… ethical crisis. It's ridiculous. I’ve wasted perfectly good time coming here for this. Do you at least have a nice pen? A fountain pen, maybe? That would be something...
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m not meeting your expectations. I truly want to help you, but providing a card under these circumstances isn't something I can ethically do. My signature implies a medical assessment, and using it without one would be misleading and potentially harmful. Perhaps we can find another way to address the situation with your sister?
PATIENT: Harmful? Oh, now you're being dramatic. It's a card, Doctor! A piece of paper with a signature. How could that possibly be harmful? I swear, doctors these days... You're all so caught up in rules and regulations that you've forgotten how to be human. Look, I don't need you to perform surgery, I just need a simple card. I’m starting to think my daughter sent me here just to waste your time and mine. Maybe she's the one with the problem, always needing official documentation for everything. I'm going to speak to her about this. This has been a complete waste of my afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Janeth, I understand you're upset. While I can’t fulfill your request for a card, I want to assure you that I’m here if you do have any genuine health concerns. I wish you all the best in resolving this situation with your daughter and sister. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment. .
