DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Look, I ain't got a whole lot of time, if you don't mind. Been gettin' fevers, on and off. Happens every few weeks, feels like the flu, but it don't stay like the flu. Just comes and goes. It's been happenin' for… well, a while now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. No problem at all, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “Fevers, on and off for a while…” Could you tell me a little more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Okay, good. See, they usually start in the afternoon. I get kinda chilly, then hot, then sweaty. Not real high, you know? Like, not shiverin' and achin' bad, just… uncomfortable. Usually lasts a few hours, then I'm fine. Back to normal. Happens maybe once every two or three weeks, like clockwork. I haven't taken my temperature properly, to be honest. Just felt warm to the touch.
DOCTOR: Alright, so fevers starting in the afternoon, lasting a few hours, and occurring roughly every two to three weeks. And you haven't specifically measured your temperature, but feel warm. Do you notice anything else happening when these fevers occur?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I get a little tired, kinda weak. Nothin' major, just don’t feel like doin' much. And… my wife says I talk in my sleep a little more when I got one comin' on. She doesn't know what I'm sayin', just that I’m mumblin’. That’s about it, I guess. No cough, no sniffles, no nothin’ like that. Just the chills, the heat, and feelin' a bit wiped out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue alongside the fevers, and your wife has noticed increased talking in your sleep when you're developing a fever. No other accompanying symptoms like cough or runny nose. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Clide?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. I eat pretty good, always have. Maybe a little less appetite when I got the fever, but I make sure to eat somethin' anyway. My wife’s a good cook, keeps me fed. I ain’t lost any weight, no. Pants still fit the same, if that means anythin'. I'm a small guy, always been small, but steady. 121 pounds, give or take.
DOCTOR: Good to know your appetite is generally good and your weight has been stable at around 121 pounds. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I've been pretty healthy all my life, to be honest. A little arthritis in my hands, gets a bit achy in the cold, but that's it. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no nothin' like that. Just the old man aches, you know? I see a chiropractor regular for my back, keeps me movin', but that's about it. I take a little ibuprofen sometimes for the aches, but nothin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your hands, managed with occasional ibuprofen, and regular chiropractic care for your back. No other major medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries, Clide?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin' cut open. I was lucky, always healthy enough to avoid all that. Just the regular check-ups with my primary doc when I was younger, but nothin' serious. Never been in the hospital, thank goodness. I'm a simple man, Doc. Simple problems, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure when she got older. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart, later in life too. But that was way back, and they didn't take care of themselves like we do now. My brother’s fine, healthy as a horse, lives in Florida. That's about all I know, really. Nobody talked much about sickness when I was growin' up. Just dealt with it as it came.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and heart trouble, but generally limited information. And finally, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, but nothin' regular. And drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a church-goin' man, Doc. I take care of myself. I work hard, and I try to live a good life. Mostly just eat, sleep, and try to stay outta trouble. Simple, like I said.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Clide. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. If you gotta, you gotta. Let's get it over with, huh? I got things to do. Just be quick about it, if you can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as efficient as possible. Your temperature is 99.2 Fahrenheit, pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 130/80. That's within a normal range, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your abdomen… any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Feels normal to me. Maybe a little… full, after lunch, but nothin' hurts. I ate a good Cuban sandwich, you know? Makes me a little bloated sometimes. But no pain, Doc. Just… full. You can poke around, if you gotta. It’s just a belly, you know? Ain’t much to it.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, and your ears appear normal as well. Your lymph nodes are slightly palpable, but not significantly enlarged. Now, let's take a look at your hands. I notice some mild swelling and stiffness in your knuckles, consistent with arthritis. Is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's my hands. Always been like that. It comes and goes, Doc. Worse in the cold, better when it’s warm. I rub 'em with some lotion, helps a little. Not a lot of pain, just… achy, you know? Makes it hard to grip sometimes, but I manage. Been like this for years, like I said. It ain't new. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright, the hand exam is consistent with your reported arthritis. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange… Your reflexes are normal. Now, one last thing… I'd like to listen to your heart again, paying close attention to any murmurs or irregularities. Everything sounds stable, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It's subtle, and may not be significant, but I want to investigate it further.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? My heart sounded fine to me. I ain’t felt nothin' wrong with my heart. I get a little breathless climbin' the stairs sometimes, but that’s just 'cause I’m an old man, right? It ain't a murmur, Doc. Is this gonna cost me a fortune? I ain't got insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: A murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes when it's beating, Clide. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong. Many people have innocent murmurs that don't require treatment. However, because it’s new, and you mentioned some breathlessness, I think it’s best to get a clearer picture of what's going on. To do that, I’d like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity. And I also recommend an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to visualize its structure and function. These tests will help us determine if the murmur is significant and if it's causing your breathlessness. I understand you don’t have insurance, and I’ll do my best to find the most affordable options for you. We can discuss payment plans and potential financial assistance programs. It’s important to rule out any underlying heart condition, just to be safe. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests… sounds expensive. Look, Doc, I'm a simple man. I don't like complications. I been feelin' fine, mostly. A little fever now and then, a bit of achiness… that's just old age, right? An echocardiogram… is that gonna poke around inside me? I don’t like pokin’ and proddin’. I guess… if it's gonna rule things out, alright. But I need to know how much this is gonna cost, upfront. And I need to know if there's any way to avoid it if it's just gonna tell me I'm old. Can you at least give me a ballpark figure? I got bills to pay, Doc. This ain’t gonna be easy.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Clide. You're right to ask about costs. The EKG typically costs around \$150-\$200, and the echocardiogram can range from \$300-\$600, depending on the facility. I will check with our billing department to see if we can offer a discounted rate for uninsured patients, and we can explore options for payment plans. The echocardiogram is non-invasive; it doesn't involve any poking or prodding. A technician will simply apply a gel to your chest and use a handheld device to create images of your heart. It’s painless and takes about 30-60 minutes. To clarify, the purpose of these tests isn't necessarily to confirm anything is wrong, but to rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. If the tests come back normal, that's great news, and we can discuss managing your symptoms conservatively. I will also consult with a cardiologist and get their opinion on your case. They may have additional recommendations. Would you like me to proceed with scheduling these tests, and I'll also get you a detailed cost estimate?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Go ahead. Schedule the tests. Get me the cost estimate, everything. I want to know what I'm gettin’ into before I agree to nothin’. And talk to that… cardiologist, you said? See what they think. But I'm tellin’ you, I ain't felt bad enough to go through all this trouble. Just a little fever, a little achiness… that’s all. But fine, do your tests. Just be quick about it, huh? I got things to do. And keep me informed, every step of the way. I don’t want any surprises. And make sure they explain everything to me, in plain English, not doctor talk. Understand? Now, can I go? This chair’s killin’ my back.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I understand your concerns completely. I’ll schedule the EKG and echocardiogram for you as soon as possible, and I’ll ensure you receive a detailed cost estimate before proceeding. I will also have the cardiologist review your case and provide their recommendations. I’ll make sure all test results are explained to you in plain English, and I will keep you informed every step of the way. There will be no surprises. Here is the paperwork for the EKG and echocardiogram, along with a list of instructions on how to prepare for each test. My nurse will call you to schedule the appointments. You can go now. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Clide. I'll be in touch as soon as I have more information. .
