DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been actin' up, that's what. My regular doctor told me to come see someone, said I needed a check-up 'cause it wasn't comin' down with the pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. Blood pressure not responding to medication, okay. And how long has this been going on, that it hasn’t been coming down with the pills?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... let me think. It’s been... a few months, I reckon. Maybe three, four? Time kinda slips away when you get to be my age. I started feelin' a bit dizzy now and then, and that’s when I really noticed it wasn’t workin' like it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness along with the high blood pressure. Do you remember roughly what your blood pressure readings were when you noticed the dizziness starting?
PATIENT: Readings? Oh, honey, I don’t remember numbers too good anymore. I just know the nurse at the other clinic checked it and said it was too high. That's all I really paid attention to, to be honest. I leave the numbers to the professionals.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. We can look those up. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, I see some readings from your previous clinic. It looks like your blood pressure has been consistently elevated, around 160/95, or even higher at times. Now, besides the dizziness, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: 160? Mercy. That does sound high. No, not much else, really. Just tired, mostly. A lot more tired than usual. And maybe a few headaches, but I get those sometimes anyway. It’s hard to say if they're different. Mostly just feelin' old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional headaches alongside the high blood pressure. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years and years ago... maybe 50 years? And I broke my hip a few years back, needed a new one put in. Aside from that... not much. I've always been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just aches and pains of gettin' old.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal a long time ago, and a hip replacement a few years back. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... family history. My mama... she had a weak heart, I think. She passed when she was pretty young, maybe in her 60s. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years back, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked like a chimney, drank too much. I always tried to be better than him, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Venna. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure ones. And a little somethin’ for my arthritis, somethin’ to help with the achin’ in my joints. I take it every mornin' and every night. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Little white pill, that’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, little white pill for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat pretty much everything, though I try to stay away from too much salt. Doc always told me to watch my salt intake. I used to love a good salty snack, but I try to be good now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. That gives me a good start. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and a few other things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, my bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your pulse is a little fast, 88 beats per minute. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 162/98, confirming your previous readings. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Slight edema in your ankles. Alright, Venna, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things we need to address.
PATIENT: Edema? Is that bad, Doctor? I do sometimes feel like my feet get a little puffy at the end of the day. I just figured it was from bein' on them too long. What do we need to do now?
DOCTOR: Edema just means some swelling, Venna, and it can be common, especially as we get older, and as you mentioned, from being on your feet. However, it can also be a sign of other things, so we want to investigate further. Given your elevated blood pressure, the murmur I heard, and the edema, I think it’s important to order a few tests. We'll do a blood test to check your kidney function and electrolytes, an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don't like goin' to the hospital, but I trust your judgment. Will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be comin' back here a dozen times.
DOCTOR: The tests are very straightforward, Venna, and shouldn’t cause any discomfort. The blood test is just a quick prick of the finger, and the EKG is non-invasive – we just place some sticky pads on your chest. The chest X-ray involves a brief exposure to radiation, but it’s a very low dose. The results usually take a few days to come back, maybe three to five business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for then to discuss them. We won’t need you to come back a dozen times, I promise. I can also have the results sent to your previous doctor if you prefer. In the meantime, let's talk about your current blood pressure medication. What are you taking, and what's the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me think… It's a little white pill... no, that's the arthritis one. The blood pressure one is… pinkish, I think. And small. Doctor at the other clinic just told me to take one every mornin'. I don’t think he told me the name of it. I’m terrible with names, always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. It's okay if you don't remember the name. We'll figure it out. Let me just pull up your records from your previous clinic again… Ah, here we go. You are currently taking Lisinopril 20mg once daily. It looks like you’ve been on this dosage for about six months. Given that it doesn’t seem to be controlling your blood pressure, we may need to adjust it, or add another medication. But let’s wait for the test results first to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… That sounds familiar. Six months... hmm. Okay, I guess waitin' for the tests is best. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Tired of feelin' tired all the time. Can I at least get somethin' for my achin' feet in the meantime? They're killin' me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Venna, and I want you to feel better too. We'll get there. And yes, absolutely, we can address your aching feet. Since you are already taking something for arthritis, we can try increasing the dose slightly, or adding a topical cream for localized relief. Do you have any preference?
PATIENT: Topical cream sounds good. I don’t want to take any more pills if I don’t have to. My stomach don’t always agree with ‘em. Anything you recommend, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. I recommend trying a cream containing diclofenac, which is a topical NSAID. It's good for reducing pain and inflammation. You can apply it to your feet a couple of times a day. You can get it over-the-counter at most pharmacies. So, to recap: We’ve ordered blood tests, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. You’ll take a topical diclofenac cream for your aching feet. We’ll follow up in about three to five business days to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. I'll get the cream at the drugstore tomorrow. And I'll try to remember all that. Thank you for listenin' to me. I appreciate it. I think that's all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
