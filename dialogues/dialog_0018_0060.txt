DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… family history, mostly. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he… well, it wasn’t pretty. Lots of heart problems. My mother’s worried, I’m worried, honestly. Just want to make sure I’m not heading down the same road, you know? I’m relatively young, still, but… better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It's very prudent to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. It's good you're thinking about this now. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about your grandfather’s heart problems?
PATIENT: Right. Um… okay. He had… I think it was something with the valves? I wasn’t a kid when he was sick, but I remember my mom saying he needed… procedures. Lots of hospital visits. He was always tired, really easily winded. And then… well, eventually he just… stopped. Heart failure, I think that's what they said. It was… a while ago, though. And my mom, she’s got high blood pressure, but she’s managing it with medication. I try to stay on top of things, but… you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Theriot. That gives me a helpful starting point. It sounds like your grandfather had significant valvular heart disease, leading to heart failure, and your mother is currently managing hypertension. To get a more comprehensive understanding of your risk, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions yourself – high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, broken arm once, but… nothing chronic. I get checked at work, yearly physicals, you know, because of the job. Everything always comes back… fine. A little low on vitamin D, sometimes, but that’s it. Honestly, I’m pretty sure I’m a healthy person. It's just… this family thing is making me anxious, is all. I don't want to end up like him.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that your yearly physicals have been consistently normal, and you don’t have any chronic conditions. It’s reassuring. And it’s perfectly understandable to be anxious given your family history, even with a clean bill of health so far. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Uh… well, I work a lot. Teaching keeps you busy. I try to eat okay, mostly. Not a lot of fast food. I like Indian food, obviously, but I don't deep fry everything. I walk when I can, but it's not like I’m running marathons or anything. I used to play cricket a lot, but I don't have time anymore. I… used to smoke, but I quit a few years ago. That was a good decision. I have a couple of beers sometimes with dinner, nothing crazy. Does that make sense? It’s pretty… average, I think.
DOCTOR: That gives me a very clear picture, thank you. It sounds like you’re making conscientious efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Quitting smoking was a particularly good decision. Now, let’s talk about your family history a bit more specifically. Besides your grandfather and mother, are there any other family members – aunts, uncles, siblings – who have experienced heart problems, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, or other cardiovascular issues?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay. Yeah, there is. My uncle, on my mother’s side, he had a stroke about five years ago. He’s recovering, but he’s… not the same. And my aunt, she has really bad cholesterol, always has. She’s on medication for it. My brother… he’s pretty healthy, as far as I know, but he doesn't really talk about that stuff. Honestly, it seems like everyone on my mother’s side has something. It’s… worrying. Makes you wonder what you’re going to get stuck with, you know? It's why I'm here, really. I just want a heads-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Theriot. It does sound like there's a significant family predisposition to cardiovascular disease. Knowing this family history is very important. To get a better assessment of your current risk, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your general health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I’d appreciate it if you could be straight with me. No sugarcoating. I want to know what I’m up against, if anything. I don’t need to be told everything’s fine if it isn’t. I’m a grown man, I can handle it. Just tell me what the risks are, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Mr. Theriot. I assure you, I will be completely honest with you and explain everything clearly. No sugarcoating, as you requested. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your heart rate is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal; I don't detect any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Your lungs are clear and there's no wheezing or crackling. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your family history, we'll want to do some further testing to get a more comprehensive picture.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. "Unremarkable" is… good, right? That's a good thing. What kind of testing? Blood work? I'm okay with blood work. Just… tell me what you're looking for. And how much it's going to cost, honestly. Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and I don't want a surprise bill.
DOCTOR: Yes, “unremarkable” is a good thing, Mr. Theriot. It means there are no immediate concerns detected during the physical exam. However, as you rightly point out, given your family history, we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel – that will check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney and liver function. We’ll also do a lipid panel to get a detailed breakdown of your cholesterol, and an EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity. And, a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein test – it measures inflammation in your body, which can be a risk factor for heart disease. Regarding the cost, let me check the Medicare coverage for each test. The comprehensive metabolic panel should be fully covered by Medicare. The lipid panel has a standard Part B deductible of $233 in 2025, and then 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. The EKG also has the same deductible and 20% co-insurance. The hs-CRP test isn't routinely covered, so there would be an out-of-pocket cost of approximately $75. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, that's… a lot of numbers. So, like, over two hundred dollars just to start? And then seventy-five on top of that? Medicare… honestly, it’s a mess. Fine. I guess I don't really have a choice, do I? It's better to know, I suppose. When can I get these tests done? Are they here, or do I have to go somewhere else? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a teaching schedule, you know. I can't just disappear for days.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Theriot. It’s certainly not ideal, but knowing these numbers will give us a baseline and allow us to make informed decisions about your health. The good news is we can do all of these tests right here in the clinic. We have a lab on-site. We can draw your blood and perform the EKG today. It should only take about 30-45 minutes. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eating a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking. And, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. That's… manageable. Two or three days, I can work with that. And yeah, I'll keep doing what I'm doing. I'm not stupid, I know the drill. Alright. Let's get this over with, then. Where do we start? And... are there any forms I need to fill out? Honestly, I hate paperwork.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. We'll start with the blood draw, and then we'll move on to the EKG. My nurse, Sarah, will be right with you to draw your blood. She's very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible. You will just need to sign a consent form for the blood work and a release of information form. Sarah has them ready for you. It’s standard paperwork, just confirming you understand the procedure and that we can share the results with you. Let me know if you have any questions at all. Sarah will explain everything in detail as well. She’s just outside the door now.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's do it. Just… try to keep it quick, alright? I have a lesson plan to finish. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Theriot. Sarah will be as efficient as possible. I appreciate your patience. .
