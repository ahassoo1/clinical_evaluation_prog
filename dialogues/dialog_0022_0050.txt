DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough. Been botherin’ me for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. It just… doesn’t go away. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ the back of my throat, but nothin’ comes up. I’m Brodie Pavlovic, by the way. Though folks usually just call me Brodie.
DOCTOR: Yes, Brodie, it’s nice to meet you too. A cough that's been lingering, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, lingering… that’s a good word for it. Seems like months now. Maybe longer? It’s hard to keep track these days, you know? I mostly just try to ignore it, but it keeps me up at night sometimes. It’s not… painful, just… irritating.
DOCTOR: I understand. Months is a long time to deal with a cough. And it’s good you’re letting me know about it now, even if it isn’t painful. To get a better idea of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Well, it’s worse when I lie down, definitely. And… sometimes when the air is really dry, like with the heat on in the winter. Does that make sense? I don’t… I don’t really know what else to tell you. It just is. Is there somethin’ specific you want to know? I forget things easy, so you might have to remind me.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Brodie, thank you. Worse when lying down and with dry air… that gives us a starting point. And no worries at all about forgetting things – I'm happy to repeat questions if needed. Let's start with this: do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old! I figure that's just… bein’ old. No fever, no chills, no shortness of breath. I eat okay, I guess. My appetite ain’t what it used to be, but… I don’t feel sick, just… coughed out. Does that make any sense? I’m probably not explainin’ this very well.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly fine, Brodie. It's helpful to know you don't have fever, chills, or shortness of breath, and that the tiredness is likely just age-related. Now, have you had this cough before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: New thing, I think. I've had little coughs before, you know, with a cold or somethin'. But never one that just… stays. This feels different. It doesn’t feel like a cold cough. It's… dry. Like sandpaper, almost. I don't remember ever havin’ a cough that lasted this long before. My wife, she always took care of things when I got sick. It's been a few years since she passed, so… my memory's not as good as it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this cough is definitely unusual for you, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. Well, I was a mechanic for most of my life. Automotive body work. Lots of dust, lots of fumes. I had some trouble with my lungs years ago, somethin’ about… irritation. I don’t really remember the specifics. The doctor at the time said it wasn’t too serious, just told me to take it easy. I had a bad knee replaced about ten years ago, and my hip a few years before that. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose. I never really got sick much. Is that helpful? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Brodie. Knowing about your work as a mechanic and the past lung irritation is important. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always handled the medications. I just took what she gave me. I don’t recall ever havin’ a reaction to anything. Dust, maybe? Bein’ a mechanic, I was around a lot of dust. But that wasn’t an allergy, just… uncomfortable. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything specific. No bee stings, no food allergies… I eat pretty much anything. I wasn't a picky eater, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ right now. My doctor took me off everything a few years back. Said I didn't need it anymore. I used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. But I stopped when the doctor said so. I just take a little vitamin D in the winter sometimes, but that’s it. Mostly, I just try to rest and drink plenty of water. My wife used to make me ginger tea when I was sick. That always helped a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brodie, that's a very helpful overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Been goin' to doctors most of my life, or at least, havin' doctors look at me. Just listen away. I’ll try to be quiet. Don't mind my coughin', though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brodie, just breathe normally. In and out… Good. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is good. I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, and a slightly prolonged expiratory phase. Your heart sounds normal, and your blood pressure is 130/80. No significant swelling in your extremities. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like you may have some underlying chronic bronchitis, possibly exacerbated by your history of exposure to dust and fumes. The wheezing suggests some airway inflammation. We should consider a chest x-ray to rule out any other underlying cause.
PATIENT: Chronic… bronchitis? Sounds… serious. Is that from bein’ a mechanic? All that dust and stuff? I knew it couldn't have been good for me. A chest x-ray… that’s alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Will the x-ray show somethin’ bad? Is it somethin’ I should be really worried about? My wife… she always knew what questions to ask. I feel a little lost now.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried, Brodie. Chronic bronchitis is often associated with prolonged exposure to irritants like dust and fumes, so your years as a mechanic could certainly be a factor. A chest x-ray will allow us to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out other possible causes for your cough, such as pneumonia or other lung conditions. It’s a routine procedure and doesn’t involve any significant risk. I don’t want to alarm you, but it's important to be thorough. Most likely, it will confirm some degree of airway inflammation, which we can manage with medication. But we need the x-ray to be certain. I'll order the x-ray now. The technician will explain the process to you. After we get the results, we can discuss treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, that sounds… okay. Manage with medication… that’s good. I just want to breathe easier. I’ll go get the x-ray. Just… tell me if there’s anything special I need to do. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ things. It helps to know what’s goin’ on, even if it’s not good news. Where do I go for the x-ray? Is it here in the clinic?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. I'm glad I could explain things clearly. It’s important to me that you feel informed. The x-ray is done over at the imaging center across the street. I will have the receptionist give you a slip with the directions and the address. They’re expecting you. Just let them know you're here for a chest x-ray ordered by Dr. Tosca. You don’t need to do anything special – just wear comfortable clothing. After the x-ray, they’ll send the results directly to me. I’ll review them and give you a call as soon as I’ve had a chance to look them over, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if your cough gets significantly worse, you develop a fever, or you experience any shortness of breath, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything very clearly. Fever… shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. And I’ll go across the street for the x-ray. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your help. I think… I think I’ll go get that x-ray done now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
