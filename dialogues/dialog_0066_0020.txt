DOCTOR: Hi Avril, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is it okay if I sit? My name is Avril Benites. It is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the telehealth visit, yes? The one they scheduled for me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, please do. And yes, that’s right – I saw you were scheduled for a follow-up visit today. Though it looks like we’re doing it in person, which is perfectly fine. Sometimes things change. Just to clarify, what were you hoping to discuss during this visit?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was a little confused about being here and not… talking on the phone. Well, my back… it has been bothering me. A lot. It is hard to bend over, and sometimes it hurts even when I am sitting. I do not know what to do. It is not like a sudden pain, it just… is always there, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Avril. A constant ache is certainly frustrating. So it’s been a gradual onset of back pain, not something that happened suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Not sudden. It started… maybe six months ago? It was just a little bit then, and I thought it would go away if I rested. But it has not. It is… worse now. I still work, you see. I am a mechanic. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, starting gradually. And you're a mechanic, so your job involves a good amount of physical activity. Is the pain worse with certain movements – bending, lifting, twisting, for example?
PATIENT: Yes, all of those. Bending is the worst, I think. And lifting… oh, yes. Even lifting something small, like a tool box, it hurts. Twisting… I try not to do that much anymore. It feels like something will… break. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Avril. That's very helpful information. And you said it’s been getting progressively worse over the past six months. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It is not the worst it has been, but… maybe a six? Sometimes it is an eight, especially after work. But today, it is a six. It is a… dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. Just… always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six out of ten right now, a dull ache, sometimes going up to an eight after work. And mostly constant. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays in my back. Sometimes it feels tight, like the muscles are… knotted. But no pain down my legs. I have not had any numbness or tingling either. I worry it is something serious, you know? I need to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It’s helpful to know there’s no radiating pain or numbness. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'd like to check your range of motion, posture, and feel for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. Do you need me to… lie down?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Avril. We can start by just standing and walking around a bit, and then we’ll move to the table. We'll start with just some simple movements. Okay, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It is a little hard, Doctor. I try to keep my back straight, but it… it hurts to do that.
DOCTOR: I see. It looks like you have a limited range of motion and some discomfort with extension. Okay, let's move over to the examination table, and I’ll gently palpate your back to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Would you lie on your stomach, please?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. This… this is not easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to gently press on your back to feel for any areas of tenderness. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm noticing some muscle spasm on both sides of your spine, particularly in the lumbar region. There's also some tenderness to palpation around L4-L5. No bony abnormalities that I can feel. Do you feel any radiating pain with this palpation?
PATIENT: No, no pain down my legs. Just… a little soreness here, where you are pressing. It is not sharp, just… uncomfortable. L4-L5… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, just soreness locally. L4-L5 is a common area for lower back pain. It's not necessarily “bad,” but it’s an area we need to pay attention to. It's a vertebral level where a lot of stress is placed on the spine. Now, I'm going to gently ask you to bend your back up and down, and side to side, just as far as is comfortable. Please let me know if you feel any sharp pain, and we’ll stop immediately. Let's start with bending your back upwards.
PATIENT: Okay. It hurts… it hurts a lot. Just… lifting up. I cannot go very far.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, and discomfort with extension. And no radiating pain. Alright, Avril, let’s sit up slowly. Okay, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it appears you have lumbar strain, likely due to the physical demands of your job. The muscle spasms and tenderness are consistent with that. I don't believe there's anything acutely concerning, such as a disc injury or nerve compression. However, we will need to rule those out, just to be certain. I would like to order an x-ray of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the bones and rule out any fractures or structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An x-ray… yes, that is okay. If it will help to know for sure… yes. I do not want it to be something serious. So… it is just my muscles? From work?
DOCTOR: That's what it appears to be, yes. The x-ray will just help us confirm that and rule out anything else. It doesn't mean I think it's something serious, but it's always best to be thorough. I'm going to write an order for the x-ray now. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, following the package instructions. You can also try applying heat or ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time. And I would advise you to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the next few days. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can take ibuprofen, yes. I usually do, when it hurts very bad. Heat… ice… I will try both. And no lifting. That is… difficult, but I understand. How long will it take to get the results from the x-ray?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies, that's helpful. As for the x-ray results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to read them and send the report to my office. My staff will contact you as soon as I've had a chance to review them. In the meantime, if your pain worsens, or you experience any numbness, tingling, weakness, or difficulty controlling your bowel or bladder, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I will wait for the call about the x-ray, and I will try to rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I'm glad I could help. Remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. Here is a handout with information about lumbar strain and some exercises you can try once the pain subsides. We’ll get those x-ray results back quickly, and we’ll go from there. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that is all. Thank you again, Doctor Condray. I will see you… when the results are back. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. You take care now. Goodbye, and feel better.
