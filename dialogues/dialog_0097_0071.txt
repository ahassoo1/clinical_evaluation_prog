DOCTOR: Hi Karry, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, my grandson… he’s wanting to come live with me here in the States. He's from… over in Europe, I believe. And I understand there are certain… shots he needs before he can get settled. I’m hoping you can tell me what those are and how to go about getting them done. It's a bit confusing, all this paperwork and requirements.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful you’re planning to have your grandson join you! It’s definitely smart to get everything sorted out with vaccinations before he arrives. It can be confusing, you're right. We want to make sure he's protected and meets any requirements for school or other activities here. To start, do you happen to know exactly where in Europe he's coming from?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I believe it’s… Poland. Yes, that’s right, Poland. He’s been living with his mother there for some time now. I don't know much about the specifics, to be honest. She handles most of the travel arrangements. I just want to be sure everything is in order on this end.
DOCTOR: Okay, Poland is helpful. That will affect what vaccinations he may already have and what he'll need. And you're very thoughtful to be getting this lined up in advance. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me his age?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. He just turned sixteen, actually. A bit of a young man now. That's another reason I want to be sure he’s covered. It feels important, you know? Being prepared.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sixteen is a key age for ensuring he's up-to-date on everything. Being prepared is always best. Okay, and has he had any vaccinations that you're aware of?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t know. His mother didn't say much about it when we spoke. I believe Poland has its own system, and she likely took care of it over there. I wouldn’t want to assume anything, though. It’s possible he hasn’t had all the ones he needs here.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious and not assume. It's best to check. We can look up the recommended vaccination schedule for teenagers and compare it to what's typically done in Poland. Do you have any records of his immunizations at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… I asked his mother to send something, but I haven’t received it yet. She said she was working on getting a translation. It’s all in Polish, you see. I have a copy of his birth certificate, if that’s any help?
DOCTOR: The birth certificate is helpful for verification, thank you. And that's smart of her to get a translation – that will be really useful. Since we don’t have the records yet, we’ll need to treat it as if he hasn’t had any vaccinations and go from there. That means we’ll likely need to start a series of shots. Do you have any concerns about vaccinations in general?
PATIENT: No, not really. I believe in modern medicine. My wife… she worked as a nurse for many years. She always told me vaccinations were important. I just… I don't want to put him through anything unnecessary, you know? And I want to be sure they’re safe.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, and I completely understand. Your wife sounds like a wise woman! We always prioritize safety, and we'll only give what's truly needed based on his age and potential exposures. Okay, to start, the CDC recommends Tdap , HPV, and a meningitis booster for teenagers. He'll also need to be up-to-date on his measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, and we'll need to check his varicella status. Before we get started, I'd like to quickly check his vital signs—weight, blood pressure, temperature—just to make sure he’s healthy enough to receive vaccinations. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I wouldn't want him getting any shots if he wasn't feeling his best. Please, go right ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don't mind, could he step on the scale for me first?
PATIENT: Certainly. He’s not with me today, Doctor. I’m just doing the preliminary work, getting all the information together. I’ll bring him in for the actual shots once we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Ah, I understand. My apologies, I assumed he was with you. That makes perfect sense. In that case, we can focus on gathering information now and create a vaccination plan for when he arrives. To proceed, could you tell me his height, if you know it?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe his mother mentioned he’s grown quite a bit. She said he was almost as tall as her, and she’s five foot eight. I’d guess… around six feet? Maybe a little shorter. I haven’t seen him in person for quite some time. It’s hard to say precisely.
DOCTOR: Okay, around six feet is helpful. We’ll confirm that when he comes in. And what about his weight?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. She didn’t mention his weight. He’s a typical teenager, I suppose. Not overly heavy, but not skinny either. Just… normal. I wish I had more precise information for you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, we can get an accurate weight when he’s here. We’ll just estimate for now. Let’s say around 170 pounds for planning purposes. Now, does he have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me think. His mother said he had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when he was younger, a rash, I believe. But she said it was years ago, and he hasn't had any issues since. Other than that, no, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of a penicillin rash is important to note. Even if it was years ago, we'll need to be careful with any medications containing penicillin. And finally, is he currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. He’s a healthy young man, thankfully. Just… regular teenage things, I suppose. He plays soccer, if that matters. A lot of running around.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Soccer is good – keeps him active. Okay, let’s summarize. We’re planning for a sixteen-year-old male, around six feet and 170 pounds, with a history of a penicillin rash, no current medications, and playing soccer. We’ll assume he needs a full series of vaccinations until we get his records. I recommend starting with Tdap, HPV, and checking his MMR status. We’ll also need to discuss the varicella vaccine. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. It’s a bit overwhelming, all these shots, but I trust your judgment. If you think that’s the best course of action, then I agree. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It can be overwhelming, but we'll take it one step at a time. Okay, I’ll prepare a vaccination schedule based on that. And I’ll write down the penicillin allergy and make a note to discuss it further when he’s here. To be on the safe side, I recommend bringing any documentation of previous illnesses or hospitalizations he may have had, even if it’s not vaccination records. It can be helpful. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient. I’ll be sure to bring any paperwork I can find. And I will definitely bring him in as soon as possible. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. It was my pleasure. I look forward to meeting your grandson. Here’s my card with the clinic's number and address. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or need to reschedule. Have a wonderful day, and safe travels when you bring him in!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
