DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Mr. Bigger. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. They tell me I have to be here. Something about… the place I work. Not feeling sick, mind you. Just… they want me checked. Old man’s problems, I suppose. Used to hard work, this body.
DOCTOR: Right, right. A check-up then, a bit of preventative care. That’s good, very good. It’s always best to stay on top of things. Now, you said you work… what sort of work do you do, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: I move things. Big things. Underground. Machines and… rocks, mostly. Used to be more rocks. Now it’s mostly machines. Loading and… well, moving them. Been doing it a long time. A very long time. Before you were born, likely. What does it matter what I do? They just want me here, yes?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Bigger. Knowing what you do helps me understand what we should be looking at. It tells me a bit about what sort of strain your body might be under. But if you’re feeling alright, that’s the most important thing. Just to be thorough, though, could you tell me if you've noticed any aches, pains, or anything different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Eh. Old man gets aches. Always aches. Back hurts when it rains. Knees complain in the cold. That’s just… being old. Not different. Everything is just… slowing down. Like a tired engine. You want me to list every creak and groan? That will take all day. They just sent me here because of the dust, I think. Lots of dust in that mine.
DOCTOR: Dust, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Lots of it. Fine dust. Gets in everything. Used to wear a mask, but… sometimes it’s hot. Hard to breathe with the mask. And they say the new machines make even more dust. Not good dust, either. Makes your throat tickle. Used to be just rock dust, now… I don’t know what it is. Something to do with the metal, I suppose. They don’t tell old men everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s very helpful, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like there’s a possibility that dust exposure could be contributing to some changes you’re experiencing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, and then maybe do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? You poking and prodding an old man? I don't like poking and prodding. I came here for a chat, not a… a check-up. They didn’t say anything about poking. If it's just a chat, fine. But no poking. Understand?
DOCTOR: No poking, alright, alright. I understand. It doesn’t have to be anything extensive, Mr. Bigger. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure… basic things to see how you’re doing overall. It will help me understand what might be going on with your breathing, given the dust exposure. It's quick, and shouldn't be uncomfortable. Would you be willing to let me listen to your chest and take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood pressure… that machine always squeezes too tight. But… I suppose. If you promise it won’t take long. And no poking. You hear? No poking and prodding. Just… the squeezing machine and listening. Quick, you said? This old man has things to do.
DOCTOR: Quick, I promise. And absolutely no poking or prodding. Just the blood pressure cuff and a listen with my stethoscope. It will only take a few minutes. If you could just sit here for me, and I’ll get started. I'll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Hurry up then. Don't want to be here all day. And be gentle with that squeezing machine. My arm is not as strong as it used to be. You young doctors… always rushing. Don’t listen to old men.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Bigger, I am listening. And I'll be as gentle as possible with the blood pressure cuff. Alright, just relax your arm for me. I'm going to inflate the cuff now. It will feel a little tight, but only for a moment. Just breathe normally… that’s good. 140 over 90… a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, I’m just going to listen to your lungs. It will also just be a quick listen. Can you take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Deep breaths… easy for you to say. Old lungs don't work like they used to. There. Happy now? Sounds like a broken bellows, doesn’t it? Always sounded like that, though. Dust, you know. Dust gets everywhere. Don't need to tell me about dust.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do hear some wheezing, Mr. Bigger, and your breath sounds are a little quieter than I’d like. That's consistent with some irritation in your lungs, and the dust exposure is certainly a concern. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. It will give us a better look at your lungs and help us rule out anything serious. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray? You want to take a picture of my insides? Is that safe? All those… rays. I’ve heard stories. And it costs money, doesn’t it? My insurance… it doesn’t cover everything. I suppose… if it's important. But no poking, remember? Just a picture. And tell me how much it will cost before you do it. I’m not made of money. Old man on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I completely understand your concerns. The X-ray uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a clear picture of your lungs outweigh the risks in this case. It’s a standard procedure, and we take every precaution to minimize exposure. Let me see… it appears your insurance does cover chest X-rays with a copay of $50. We can also verify that with the billing department before proceeding, if you’d like. Would you be comfortable with getting the X-ray?
PATIENT: Fifty dollars… hmph. Not ideal, but… I suppose. Better to know what's rattling around in there. But… where do I go? Do I have to walk all over this city? And will it take all day? I don't have all day to spend in a hospital. Just tell me where to go, how long it will take, and no poking! And make sure they know I'm an old man. Need a chair to sit in while I wait, likely.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bigger. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center just down the street – it’s only a five-minute walk. They are very accommodating and have plenty of seating. Here’s the address and phone number. The receptionist can schedule you for the soonest available appointment. The X-ray itself only takes a few minutes, but allow about an hour total for check-in and paperwork. And I’ve noted on the form that you are an elderly patient who requires a chair. Once they have the results, they will send them directly to me, and I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Five minutes walk… can manage that. An hour… tolerable. As long as I can sit down. You’ve written everything down, yes? Old man forgets things. Don't want to be wandering around lost. Alright. An hour. Five-minute walk. Chair. I'll go. But if they poke me, I'm blaming you, Doctor. You hear? Blaming you. Now… can I go? I have things to do, you know. Real things. Not sitting around waiting for pictures to be taken.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bigger. You can definitely go. And I understand. I’ve made a note of everything – no poking! I’ll be expecting a call from the imaging center with the results. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Get yourself home safely, and try not to lift anything too heavy. .
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure is a strong word. But… alright. Don't tell me to not lift things. What else am I supposed to do? But… thank you. For not poking me, at least. Old man problems… always something.
