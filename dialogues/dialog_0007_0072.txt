DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Hernandez, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve just been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. Memory issues are common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. “Little things” can sometimes be a sign of something easily addressed. To start, can you give me some examples of these things you're forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Like, I went to the grocery store yesterday and completely forgot milk. I needed milk for coffee this morning! And… last week, I had a dentist appointment – not here, another one – and just… missed it. Didn't even realize until I got a call. It's not like I’m forgetting everything, just… details. Important details, lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Forgetting things like milk or a single appointment… that happens to everyone. But the fact that it’s becoming more frequent, and you’re noticing it’s impacting your day, is what we want to look into. About how long has this been going on, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly… maybe three or four months? It started slowly, just little lapses. But in the last month or so, it’s definitely gotten worse. I used to be so organized, and now… not so much. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months… and a noticeable increase in the last month. That gives us a timeframe. Have you noticed this impacting other areas of your life – work, hobbies, relationships?
PATIENT: Well, work is… okay. I’m a dentist, so I’m pretty focused when I’m with patients, I think. I haven’t messed anything up there yet, thankfully. But my apartment… it's a disaster. I used to love having people over, but I’m too embarrassed now. And I’ve been cancelling plans with friends a lot, just because I can’t remember things or feel like I'm not up to it. It's…isolating, a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is causing you some real stress and impacting your quality of life, which is definitely something we want to address. Let's go through a bit more detail. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, not that I’ve noticed. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I work long hours, so that could just be that. No headaches, no dizziness, no changes in my vision. Just… the forgetting. And a little bit of anxiety about it, to be honest. I keep worrying I'm getting… you know… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other neurological symptoms, just the memory issues and some anxiety. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. No major illnesses or surgeries. I don’t really take any medications regularly, just over-the-counter stuff when I have a cold. And I'm allergic to penicillin. That's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, penicillin allergy, and no regular medications. Good. What about family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a little more complicated. My mom had some health problems when she was older, but I’m not really sure what. She passed away a few years ago, and my dad wasn’t very forthcoming with details. I think she was a little forgetful towards the end, but everyone forgets things when they get old, right? I don’t know if it was anything serious. My grandma on my dad’s side… she had dementia, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible family history of memory issues, but limited details. That’s alright, we can work with that. Finally, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I try to eat healthy, mostly, though I haven't been cooking much lately. Too tired, I guess. I used to exercise regularly, but I’ve been slacking on that too. It’s a bit of a downward spiral, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol use, otherwise healthy lifestyle, but some recent changes in exercise and diet. Thank you for being so open. Alright, Ebony, I think we have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could sit up here for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure and then I’ll check your reflexes and do a quick memory test. It won't be anything strenuous. Blood pressure is normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are good. Now, let’s do a quick memory test. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I’ll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those back to me, please?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Got it.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Now, we’ll move on to some other parts of the exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound good. Cranial nerves are intact. Now, let's come back to those three words in a few minutes. While we wait, can you tell me if you've had any changes in your vision, hearing, or sense of smell recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision is a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so that's not new. I think my hearing is okay, and my sense of smell seems normal. Nothing out of the ordinary, I don’t think. It's just the forgetting, really. I keep getting distracted thinking about it. I'm worried I’m missing something important at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new changes in vision, hearing, or smell. That’s good. Alright, let's revisit those three words. Can you tell me what they were again?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… apple… and… table… and… oh, darn. I can't remember the third one! I know there were three… I feel so silly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s not a silly feeling at all. It’s not about remembering perfectly, it's about seeing how your memory is functioning. Ebony, based on what you've told me, and this brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some early memory changes. It's important to investigate this further. There are a lot of possible causes, ranging from stress and vitamin deficiencies to more concerning conditions. I want to order some blood work to check for things like vitamin B12 and thyroid levels. I also recommend a brain MRI to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. It’s a precautionary measure, to rule out anything serious. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… a little scary, honestly. An MRI? But… if it will help figure out what’s going on, I guess so. Blood work I can handle. I just… I’m worried about what it might show. Is it likely to be something bad? I’m a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ebony. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried when facing the unknown. It’s important to remember that an MRI is just a tool, and it doesn’t automatically mean something is wrong. It simply gives us more information to work with. The vast majority of people who experience memory issues don’t have serious conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. There are many treatable causes. We’re going to take this one step at a time. We'll start with the blood work and MRI, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan. I’ll give you a referral for the MRI and a lab order for the blood work. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks sounds good. Okay. I guess… I just need to try and stay calm. And… not Google everything, I suppose. That always makes it worse. So, the referral and lab order… where will I go for those?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right about the Googling - best to leave that to us! Here’s the referral for the MRI. You can schedule an appointment with the imaging center at [Imaging Center Name and Phone Number]. The lab order is for [Lab Name and Address]. You can walk in anytime during their business hours. I'll also have the nurse give you a printout with some resources for managing stress and anxiety. She can also answer any questions you have about the appointments. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Ebony?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Hernandez. You’ve been very helpful, even though it’s a little frightening. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just brush it off. I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad you came in too. It’s always better to address these things proactively. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’re here to support you through this. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
