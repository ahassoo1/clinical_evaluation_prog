DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Meigs. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thank you. My back... it really hurts. Been hurting bad for maybe a week now. Worse than usual, you know? I already have the… the cancer. So, I thought maybe this pain is different.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're being proactive, especially with your history. When you say “different”, can you tell me more about how this back pain is different from what you’ve experienced before with your cancer-related pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Before, the pain… it was more like a dull ache, all over. This is… sharp. Like someone is stabbing me. And it goes down my leg now. Not all the time, but it does. And it's hard to stand up straight. Before, I could still get around, you know? Still slow, but I could do things. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain radiating down your leg and difficulty standing – that definitely warrants a closer look. To get a better picture, can you pinpoint exactly where on your back the pain is worst?
PATIENT: Right here. Low, low back. And it feels like it goes into my… my hip. And then down the back of my leg, like I said. Not my whole leg, just the back part. It’s really bad when I try to bend over.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back pain with radiation into the hip and back of the leg, worsened with bending… I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on. It worries me, you know? With the… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I'm just going to press here and here… any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes. Right there. That’s where it hurts. And… when you do that, it makes my leg tingle a little bit. Not numb, just… tingly. Like pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, could you try and bend forward slowly, as far as is comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh… whoa. That's… not good. It's hard, and it really hurts. And the pain goes all the way down my leg when I do that. I can’t go very far, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you try and stand on one leg for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… I’m not very good at this. It feels… weak. My back is shaking. I don’t think I can do this for long. Not good. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, Ms. Meigs, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may have a pinched nerve—likely sciatica. However, given your history of cancer, we need to rule out other potential causes. I want to get some imaging done—an MRI of your lower back—to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. If that’s what you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Will it show if it’s… if the cancer has spread? I'm really scared, you know?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs. The MRI will give us a lot of information, including whether there's any involvement of the bone or surrounding tissues. But we're not necessarily jumping to that conclusion right now. It could be a number of things, and the MRI will help us differentiate. We'll also look at the scans together and discuss the results thoroughly. I'm going to order the MRI and I'll have my nurse schedule it for you. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain. We'll also discuss some gentle stretches you can do, if comfortable, and I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or twisting for now. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay. Muscle relaxant… and anti-inflammatory. And no lifting. I can do that. Stretching… I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things. It helps a lot. Will I need to see a specialist if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. If the MRI shows something concerning, I will definitely refer you to a specialist – either a neurosurgeon or an oncologist, depending on the findings. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. I'm also going to order a blood test to check for inflammation markers and to get a baseline, just to be thorough. My nurse will also go over the medication instructions with you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything for now. Just… try to stay positive, right? Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’m just worried, you know? But I trust you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. Staying positive is important, and we'll work through this together. I understand your worry completely. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and schedule those tests. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your pain worsens. .
