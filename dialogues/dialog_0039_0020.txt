DOCTOR: Hello Avril, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Is good to meet you too. I… how you say… the hospital send me for… a check. A talk, yes? My husband… he pass last year. And they want to make sure I am okay. Not sick, you understand? Just… check.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's very thoughtful of the hospital to arrange a check-up after such a loss. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. It’s perfectly normal to want to make sure everything is alright, both physically and emotionally. So, we'll just have a chat, go over your health history, and do a quick examination if that’s alright with you. No pressure at all. We'll take things at your pace. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally since your husband passed?
PATIENT: Generally…? Hmm. It is… quiet. Very quiet. He always talk. Always something to do. Now… I try to keep busy. I work at the garage, you know? Fix car. That help. But… some days, is hard to get up. Hard to… want to do anything. I sleep more than before, I think. Not sick sleep, just… long sleep. And sometimes, my stomach… it feels bad. Not all the time, but… when I think too much, maybe. Is that… okay to say?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly okay to say. It sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of normal grief responses. The quiet, the changes in sleep, the stomach troubles… those are all very common when someone experiences a significant loss. It’s good that you’re still working and trying to keep busy – that’s a really positive thing. You mentioned your stomach feels bad when you think too much. Can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: It is… not pain, exactly. More like… flutter. And sometimes, is tight. Like… rope around it. Not all the time, like I said. And… I don't eat as much. Not because I don't want to, but… food don't taste the same. He always make good food. We eat together every night. Now… I just have a little soup, maybe. Or bread. Nothing fancy. Is hard to make myself cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluttering and tightness, more common when you're feeling stressed or thinking a lot… and a decreased appetite, things not tasting the same. That all makes sense. It sounds like the grief is really impacting your appetite and your digestive system. Have you noticed any other changes since your husband passed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My back… it hurts more. I always have little bit of back pain, from working at the garage. But now… it is worse. I take some pills for it, the white ones. But they don't help as much. And… I forget things. Not big things, you understand? Like… where I put my glasses. Or… the name of the street where my friend live. Small things. It is… annoying. But not scary. Just… old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased back pain despite taking medication, and some forgetfulness. It’s good you’re aware of these changes. It could be just age, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. Do you remember what kind of medication you're taking for your back pain?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see… is a small white pill. Round. I get it from the… the man doctor. Not you. The one who look at bones. The… orthopedic? Yes, that is it. He give me this pill… maybe two years ago? I take two every morning. And sometimes, if it is very bad, I take one more at night. But it not help much, like I said. I don't remember the name of it. I just know it is white. And small.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just quickly check our records to see what the orthopedic doctor prescribed for you. One moment… Ah, here we are. It looks like you’ve been prescribed Naproxen 500mg twice a day as needed for back pain. Now, sometimes, with long-term use, medications can have side effects, and it’s good to be aware of those. And the forgetfulness you mentioned… that's something we should explore further. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yes, that is right. The white pill. I… no. No other sickness. Just… old. I take some vitamins, for my bones. The doctor tell me, because I am tall. He say tall people need more vitamins. And… I had the flu last winter. But everyone had the flu last winter. Nothing serious. I just… rest and drink tea. That is all. I don't like to take much medicine. Only if I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other significant medical conditions, just vitamins for your bones – that’s good. And you had the flu last winter, which is common. It's good you prefer to avoid medication when possible. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family…? Hmm. My mother… she have problems with her heart. She pass away when I was young. Maybe sixty? I don’t remember exactly. My father… he was strong. Never sick. He work on the farm all his life. And my brother… he have… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, yes? He is still alive, but he have to be careful with what he eat. Is that… helpful? I don’t know much about family sickness. We don’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. It’s good to know about your mother’s heart problems and your brother’s diabetes. Family history can give us clues about potential risks. It’s perfectly normal if you don’t know a lot about it – many families don’t discuss it much. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke, but I never like it. And I… no. No alcohol. Only sometimes, a little wine with dinner. Very little. And… no drugs. Never. I am old-fashioned. I just like to work and… be quiet. And now… I try to keep busy. That is all. It is a simple life.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. It sounds like you live a very healthy lifestyle. A simple life is a good life. Now, just to finish up with the history, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies? Let me think. No. I don’t think so. Never have. Sometimes, if I eat too much tomato, my stomach feel a little bad. But that is just… tomato. Not a real allergy. And… no. No allergies to medicine. I take the Naproxen, like you say, and I don’t have any trouble with it. I have never had a problem with any medicine before. I think I am lucky. Is that… all the questions?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s all the questions for now. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. If you need to listen to my heart, you can. I don't mind. And check my pressure… whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to make sure I am okay. It is good to know everything is… working. Like it should.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Avril. That means a lot. Alright, if you could just sit comfortably, I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur but that's common with age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Reflexes are normal, balance seems good. No obvious neurological deficits. Okay, everything seems generally good. But given your symptoms – the sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, stomach troubles, forgetfulness, and slightly elevated blood pressure – and your recent loss, I think it's important to consider a few possibilities. It could be a normal grieving process, but we need to rule out other things.
PATIENT: That is… what things? What other things could it be? Is it serious? I don't like to worry. I just want to feel… normal again. Like before.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I don’t want to cause you to worry unnecessarily. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. We need to rule out things like a thyroid problem, which can cause fatigue, weight changes, and stomach issues. And sometimes, vitamin deficiencies can cause similar symptoms. Also, it’s important to monitor your blood pressure to make sure it doesn't get too high. And because of the forgetfulness, we should do some basic cognitive screening to assess your memory. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests. They’ll check your thyroid levels, vitamin levels, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. And I’ll give you a short questionnaire to assess your memory. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… questionnaire…? Yes, if you think it is necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have to go back to the garage this afternoon. I have a car to fix. A very important car.
DOCTOR: No, the blood test won’t hurt. It's just a quick needle prick, and it will be over before you know it. The questionnaire is just a series of simple questions, it won't take long at all – maybe 10-15 minutes. The results usually take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, I'd like to suggest a few things. Try to get some gentle exercise, like walking, if you're able. And focus on eating regular, nutritious meals, even if you don't feel hungry. And most importantly, be kind to yourself. Grief takes time, and it's okay to not feel okay. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and give you the questionnaire. And, don’t worry about the car – we can work around your schedule. Your health is the most important thing. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
