DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I'm hoping we can talk about losing a little weight. It's… becoming a bit of a problem, and I was hoping there might be something – perhaps a medication – that could help. I’m Vicent Osumi, by the way. Though I believe you have that on your chart.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Osumi, I do. Though it's always good to confirm. Losing weight is a problem...or rather, gaining weight. People seem to use the terms interchangeably these days. And you're hoping for a quick fix, then?
PATIENT: A “quick fix” sounds a bit… dramatic, Doctor. More like a little assistance, if you please. It's not that I haven't tried, you see. It’s just… harder now than it used to be. My wife, God rest her soul, always kept us both very active. It’s been a few years since she passed, and things… slipped. I’d like to get back to a healthier place, if possible.
DOCTOR: I see. A change in lifestyle, then. Loss of a partner is… significant. It’s common for routines to be disrupted. So, you’ve noticed a gradual weight gain since your wife’s passing. About how long ago was that, and roughly how much weight would you estimate you've gained?
PATIENT: It’s been… seven years now, Doctor. Seven years this November. And as for the weight… well, I haven't really weighed myself regularly. Perhaps… twenty, maybe twenty-five pounds? It’s hard to say exactly. Clothes are fitting a little tighter, that’s for sure. And I get winded easier, walking up the steps. It’s not a drastic change, but it's enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Twenty to twenty-five pounds over seven years... that's a steady, gradual increase. And shortness of breath with exertion. Alright. Before we even consider medication – which, frankly, I’m rarely keen on as a first step – let’s get a clearer picture. Do you have any other health problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly. It acts up when the weather changes, you know? And my blood pressure… the nurse usually checks it when I come in, and it's sometimes a little high. Otherwise, I’d say I'm fairly healthy, for an old man like me. I had a cholesterol check last year, and it was… borderline, I think they said. I don't recall the exact numbers, though. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Borderline cholesterol, arthritic knees, and intermittent hypertension. Yes, that does help. And are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve always tried to avoid medication if possible. For the arthritis, I just try to take it easy and use a heating pad when it flares up. And the blood pressure… I watch my salt intake, mostly. The doctor before Dr. Overgaard, he suggested watching the salt and keeping active, but… well, as we discussed, that’s been difficult lately. I don’t take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Right. No regular medications. Good. Let's do a quick exam, then. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, check your reflexes, and take your weight and blood pressure to get a baseline. Then we can discuss some options. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten just about everything over the years. Though, I do sometimes get heartburn, if I eat something spicy. But I don't think that's an allergy, just an… old man’s stomach. Let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please step onto the scale for me, Mr. Osumi. And afterwards, if you wouldn't mind removing your shirt, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure, you understand.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Standard procedure. Just trying to be efficient with my time, that’s all. There. Done.
DOCTOR: 87 kilograms… that puts you at a BMI of 30.1. Officially obese, Mr. Osumi. Not judging, just stating facts. Now, if you’ll please have a seat and remove your shirt. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Obese, you say? Well. That's… not good news. I suppose I knew it wasn’t ideal. Alright, here we go. Try not to laugh, Doctor. I haven’t seen this thing in a while.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but a slight… decreased breath sounds at the bases. Nothing alarming, but worth noting. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Blood pressure is 145/90. Elevated. Alright, Mr. Osumi. Everything checks out, within reasonable expectations for your age and weight. Now, let’s talk about a plan.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, huh? Figures. So, what’s the plan, Doctor? You mentioned something about… not medication first? I’m ready to hear it, even if it's not what I want to hear. I just want to get back to feeling a little bit better, if that's possible. I'm a practical man, Doctor. Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Practical, good. My recommendation, and it will likely be disappointing, is lifestyle modification. Specifically, dietary changes and increased physical activity. Gradual changes, starting small. Reduce your calorie intake – less processed foods, more fruits and vegetables. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Walking is excellent. We can refer you to a nutritionist and a physical therapist if you'd like. I'm not convinced you need medication at this time, but we'll need to monitor your blood pressure closely. A home blood pressure monitor would be a good investment. And follow-up appointments every three months to assess your progress. We can discuss medication if these measures prove insufficient, but it's rarely a long-term solution without addressing the underlying issues. Does that sound… feasible?
PATIENT: Feasible… It’s not ideal, Doctor. I’d hoped for a little bit of a shortcut, to be honest. But… I understand what you’re saying. A nutritionist and a physical therapist… that sounds like a lot of appointments. But if it’s what needs to be done… alright. A home blood pressure monitor sounds sensible. And three-month check-ups… fine. Let’s start with those appointments, then. And… tell me about the nutritionist. Is she strict? I like my food.
DOCTOR: Strictness varies, of course. I can recommend Mrs. Reyes. She’s… pragmatic. She won't force you to eat kale if you detest it, but she will encourage healthier choices. She focuses on sustainable changes, not restrictive diets. I’ll fax a referral to her office, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. As for the physical therapist, I recommend Mr. Silva. He specializes in geriatric care, and he's excellent at developing tailored exercise programs. I'll send a referral for him as well. In the meantime, start tracking your blood pressure twice daily – morning and evening – and keep a food diary. Just a simple record of what you eat and drink. This will give us a baseline to work with. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, contact me immediately. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that covers everything. Mrs. Reyes and Mr. Silva, you say? I’ll expect a call from them, then. And twice-daily blood pressure and a food diary… alright. Sounds like a lot of work, but… I suppose I can manage. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. I appreciate your honesty, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. And… thank you for not laughing. I’ll see you in three months. I expect you to be very disappointed with my progress. .
DOCTOR: Don’t anticipate disappointment, Mr. Osumi. Anticipate effort. And effort is commendable, regardless of the outcome. I’ll see you in three months. And do contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Goodbye.
