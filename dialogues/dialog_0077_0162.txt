DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's my stomach, alright? Just…bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. Honestly, it's been going on a while, and I just want to know what I need to take to fix it. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I assure you I want to help. “Bloated” can mean many things, though, and it’s important to understand how long this has been going on, and any other symptoms you might be experiencing. When you say "a while," could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics… Honestly? I don't keep track of that stuff. Maybe a couple of months? It comes and goes. It's just…uncomfortable. I eat, and then I feel full, then I get all puffed up. It's annoying, alright? Look, I work hard, I don't have time to be dealing with this. Is it something serious? Because if it's not, I'd like to just get something for it and be done. My wife…well, she used to handle all this stuff. Now it's just me. So, yeah. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: I see. A couple of months of intermittent bloating after eating. It sounds… distressing, especially with the change in responsibilities. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. To clarify, is there anything specific that seems to trigger the bloating – certain foods, perhaps?
PATIENT: Foods? Honestly, no. I eat pretty much whatever. Steak, pasta, doesn't matter. It just…happens. I wouldn't say there's a pattern. Maybe when I eat a lot? But I work hard, I need to eat! I'm a pile driver operator, Doc, it’s not like I’m sitting behind a desk all day. It’s heavy work. Look, I'm starting to feel like I'm being asked a million questions for something simple. Is this going to take long? I got a job site to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Kristofik, and I'll be as efficient as possible. I’m simply trying to gather enough information to ensure we address the root cause of the problem, and not just the symptom. A few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Look, my stomach feels big, okay? I don't need a list of possibilities. No pain, no…I don’t know…nothing else really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I work long hours, alright? Honestly, I'm not sure what you’re getting at. Just tell me what pill I need and let me get going. Is it something over-the-counter or do I need a prescription? This is really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no other digestive issues, just bloating and fatigue. And you’ve mentioned it’s been going on for a couple of months. Before we discuss medication, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Seriously? Look, I don't have time for poking and prodding. Is this really necessary? I just want something to make it stop. If it’s not serious, can’t we just skip that part? I'm telling you, I work hard, I eat, and my stomach gets big. What more is there to know? Honestly, this feels like a waste of my time. Is there anything faster we can do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I truly want to respect your time. However, a brief examination allows me to assess your overall health and ensure there isn’t something more concerning causing your symptoms. It's a standard part of evaluating abdominal discomfort. It will only take a few minutes. If everything seems normal, we can discuss over-the-counter options, or if needed, consider further investigation. I want to make sure we’re not missing anything important. It's about being thorough. Would you at least allow me to listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just listen, alright? But that’s it. No poking, no prodding, no anything else. And if you don’t find anything, I want a recommendation for something I can take right now. I have a job to get back to, and frankly, I'm losing patience. Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be helpful. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen in four different areas. Please try to relax your muscles. Okay…bowel sounds are present, though a bit…hyperactive. Not a significant finding, but worth noting. Any tenderness when I press gently here?
PATIENT: Ugh, stop poking around! It’s…slightly uncomfortable, okay? I told you, I don't like being touched. It's just my stomach, Doc. It gets bloated. What’s the big deal? Are you finding something? Just tell me straight. And don’t make me lie here all day. This is ridiculous. Honestly, I could be halfway done with the job by now. Is it something serious, yes or no?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No significant tenderness. And I understand your discomfort, Mr. Kristofik. I’m not finding anything acutely alarming, but given the persistence of your symptoms and the hyperactive bowel sounds, I'm inclined to suggest we explore a few possibilities. It could be related to diet, stress, or even a mild form of irritable bowel syndrome. Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to order a simple blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood test? Seriously? More waiting? Look, I’m a pile driver operator, not a patient! I don't have time for tests and waiting and poking and prodding! Is there anything I can take right now? Like, something over-the-counter? Something for gas? Just tell me what to buy at the drugstore and let me go. This is getting me nowhere. My wife… she always knew what to do. I'm just… lost without her. I just want this to stop. But I don't have time for this whole song and dance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, and I truly apologize for the inconvenience. Given your discomfort and limited time, we can try an over-the-counter medication for gas and bloating, such as simethicone. It’s generally safe and can provide some relief. However, it’s important to remember this won’t address the underlying cause of your symptoms. Here’s a handout with information about simethicone and some general dietary recommendations for managing bloating. If your symptoms persist or worsen, I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can explore further testing and diagnosis. It's important to rule out anything more serious. And, if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about the medication or the handout?
PATIENT: Fine. Simethicone. Got it. Look, thanks, Doc. I appreciate you trying to help. I'll try it and see if it works. Honestly, I just want this to be over with. I need to get back to work. I'm sure it's nothing serious. Just a bloated stomach. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kristofik. I hope you find some relief. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. Take care, and be safe on the job site.
