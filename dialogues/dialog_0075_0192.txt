DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Panjoj. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, right. I'm here for… this exam. For the army. Gotta get it done, you know? They want it before I can… well, before anything happens. It's all paperwork, mostly, I guess. Don’t see why a doctor needs to look at me, but rules are rules.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-service exam for the army. I understand. While it is mostly paperwork, a quick examination ensures everything is as it should be and helps us complete the forms accurately. It's for your benefit as well, to make sure you're starting this journey in good health. Let’s start with some basic information. I see here you’re 51 years old. And your height is listed as 187 centimeters and weight as 53 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Six foot two, give or take. And… 53? Hmm. Might be a little low. I haven't weighed myself properly in a while, to be honest. Been busy. But yeah, around that weight, I suppose. Not like I’m stuffing myself with pastries or anything. It’s not like it matters much, is it? They just want bodies, don’t they?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Hartness. However, an accurate weight is important for calculating certain health metrics and ensuring your overall fitness for service. We can easily verify it here. Would you be comfortable stepping on the scale?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not exactly built like a… a fitness model, alright? I work with engines. It’s not a desk job. But I’m strong, I can tell you that. I can lift things most folks couldn't even think about lifting. Is that not enough? I don’t see why I need to stand on a scale. It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, and I appreciate your strength and work ethic, Mr. Hartness. It's excellent that you're physically capable. The weight isn’t about judging your capabilities, it’s a standard part of the medical assessment, and helps us create a complete picture of your health. It also helps to rule out any underlying conditions that might affect your service. It will only take a moment, and it’s confidential, of course. If you’re uncomfortable, we can discuss alternatives, but it may make completing the paperwork more difficult. Would you be willing to step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don't go making a fuss about it. It's just a number, right? A silly number. I suppose I can stand on your… machine. Where is it? Don't expect anything good. Honestly, you doctors and your scales… it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hartness. It’s over there. No fuss at all, just information. I’ll step out of the room to give you some privacy. Please just let me know when you’re finished.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. What was your weight on the scale?
