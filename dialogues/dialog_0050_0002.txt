DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my waterworks. They just… aren’t working so good anymore. It’s hard to… push it all out, you know? Like it’s stuck. It's been a bit of a bother, really. Not painful, just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with urination, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Difficulty. It feels like… like trying to push water through a small pipe, maybe? Does that make sense? I don't really know what else to tell ya. It just… takes a long time, and I have to strain a bit. It's not like it always happens, but often enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better understanding. And how long has this been occurring, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That's a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a few months? Or longer? Time… it all blends together, you know? I think it started slowly, and just got a little worse over time. It wasn't sudden, not like a shock or anything. Just… gradual. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more specific. It's hard to remember these things.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's perfectly understandable. A few months is helpful. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Well, I get up a few times at night to go, more than I used to, maybe? And sometimes… sometimes it feels like I don't quite empty everything. Like there's still a little left in there. Not a lot, but… something. Does that count? I don’t know if that’s related, though. My memory isn't what it used to be, so I might be forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency at night, and a sensation of incomplete emptying… yes, those are relevant. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at all. It's not burning, thankfully. It’s just… weak, you know? Like the stream isn’t very strong. And like I said, hard to get it all out. It's not uncomfortable, exactly, just… frustrating. It takes a lot longer than it used to, and I have to push. That's the main thing, I think. Pushing.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain or burning, just a weak stream, difficulty emptying, and the need to strain. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Color and smell… I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. I just… go when I need to go. I don’t usually look at it, if you know what I mean. It seems normal enough, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything different, not that I can recall. Sorry, I’m not much help with that one. I don’t think I’ve seen any blood or anything scary.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… Well, I've lived a long life, Doctor. I've had the usual aches and pains, I suppose. I had my gallbladder out many years ago. And… oh, and arthritis, in my hands mostly. It flares up sometimes. I see a doctor for that, gets me some cream. Other than that… I think that’s about it. Nothing major, that I remember. I'm on a little pill for my blood pressure, too, but that’s not new. Does that help? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Gallbladder removal and arthritis, with medication for blood pressure. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything the doctors have given me, not that I recall. I take the arthritis cream regularly, and the blood pressure pill, and haven't had any problems with either. I used to be allergic to bees when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in years! Does that count? I think I'm okay with most things, honestly. But it’s always best to ask, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indeed. No known drug allergies. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, later in life. And my brother… he had something with his sugar, diabetes, I believe. It was a long time ago. Lots of my family lived a long time, but they all had their troubles, you know? It’s hard to remember exactly what everyone had. We didn't talk about it much back then. Mostly just took things as they came. I don't think anything really runs in the family, not that I can remember. We were a strong lot, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I'd like to gently examine your abdomen and, with your permission, perform a digital rectal examination to assess your prostate. This will help me to understand what might be causing your urinary difficulties. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Checking my heart and lungs, that's fine. And my blood pressure, of course. But… a digital… rectal examination? Well, that sounds… a bit personal, Doctor. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. Is it really necessary? I don’t like the sound of it at all. Could we try something else first? I just… I’m an old woman, you know? It feels a bit… intrusive. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Stoffregen. You are right to ask. A digital rectal examination is often helpful in evaluating urinary symptoms in women, as it allows me to assess the tone of your muscles and check for any abnormalities that might be contributing to your difficulties. However, it is not absolutely essential, and we can proceed without it if you prefer. Given your discomfort, we can start with a thorough abdominal examination and a urine sample to check for infection or other issues. If those tests are inconclusive, we can discuss the possibility of a referral to a urologist who can perform further investigations, including imaging studies. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds much better, Doctor. A urine sample and checking my tummy… that I can do. And a referral to a… a urologist, if needed. Yes, that sounds sensible. I’m much more comfortable with that. I really don't like the sound of poking around down there. Thank you for understanding. You're a kind doctor. Let's start with the tummy check and the sample, then. That sounds just perfect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll excuse me for a moment, I’ll have the nurse bring you a container for your urine sample and a gown to change into if you wish. Afterwards, we can begin the abdominal examination here. It will just involve me gently pressing on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That sounds very good. I’ll just go and… do the sample, then. And change, maybe. It's a bit warm in here, you know. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better.
