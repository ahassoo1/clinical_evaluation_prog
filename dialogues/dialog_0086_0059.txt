DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, good morning to you too. It's… well, it's my speech, I think. It’s been a bit off lately. Not as clear as it usually is, you know? It’s hard to explain, really. It just feels…slurred, sometimes. I don’t quite remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Slurred,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not all the time, mind you. Sometimes I notice it more than others. It’s just… worrying. And my husband, he's been noticing it too, which is why I decided to come in. He gets concerned easily, bless him. Do you… need me to say something specific to hear it? I’m happy to.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Just a normal sentence will do. And tell me, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… let me think. “The weather is quite pleasant today, isn’t it?” Is that alright? And… other changes? Gosh, that’s a tough one. Work’s been busy, same as always with construction… I don’t think anything major has changed, no. Just the usual stresses, I suppose. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about any headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes, yes. But I get those a lot, honestly. Stress headaches, I think. Nothing too severe. Dizziness… not really, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Vision is fine, I believe. And weakness… no, I don’t think so. Everything feels… normal, apart from the speech, of course. It’s just… frustrating, trying to remember everything. It’s like it’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy?
PATIENT: Yes, fuzzy. Like… I know I should remember when this started, or if anything else has been going on, but it’s just… not coming to me easily. It’s not like I’m forgetting important things, just… details. It’s hard to explain. Like a cloud over my memory, maybe? It doesn't happen all the time, but it’s been more frequent lately, I think. Is that… normal? I'm sorry if I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, I have Medicare, so I must have something on file, I suppose. Let me think… nothing major, as far as I know. My husband handles most of the paperwork, you see. He says I was checked out regularly for a bit, but I can't recall exactly what for. Is there a way to find out what's on my record? I'm really sorry I can't be more specific. It’s just… all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, someone has to keep track of these things. Let me see… According to this, you had some minor childhood illnesses, nothing of note. No significant past medical history listed. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Never have been much of a pill-taker, if I’m honest. Just the usual over-the-counter things when I have a headache, but nothing regularly. Is that… concerning? Should I be taking something? I’m really starting to worry now, with you looking at the records like that.
DOCTOR: Concerning?
PATIENT: Well… it just feels like you’re expecting something to be wrong, you know? And I’m terrible at remembering things, so if there is something I’ve forgotten, I wouldn’t even know! My husband always says I’m a bit of a space cadet, bless his heart. He worries terribly, and now I’m worrying, and it’s all a bit much, really. Is it normal to feel this confused about your own health history? I’m sorry to ramble.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to get a clearer picture. I'm going to do a brief neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It's standard procedure. It will involve a few simple tests. Can you follow simple instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can follow instructions. Simple ones, anyway. As long as they’re not too complicated! My coordination is usually fine, I think. I work on construction sites, so I have to be fairly steady on my feet. It's just… the speech is what’s bothering me. But yes, please, go ahead. I’ll do my best. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head. Just your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can do that. Just my eyes, you said? No moving my head. Is this… normal? It’s just, I haven’t had many medical exams before.
DOCTOR: Yes, normal. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Okay. Is this too tight? I don’t want to hurt you. I’m not very strong, to be honest. I do a lot of paperwork on the construction site, not a lot of heavy lifting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to say “hello” for me. And then I’ll ask you to repeat a phrase.
PATIENT: Hello. Is that alright? I think my speech is a bit worse now, or maybe it's just my nerves. It’s harder to say things when I’m feeling anxious.
DOCTOR: Right. And now, I’m going to ask you to repeat this phrase: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
PATIENT: “Thuh… quick… brown… foks… jumbs… ovuh… thuh… layzee… dawg.” Oh dear. That wasn't very good, was it? I'm so sorry. It's just… my tongue feels all clumsy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this preliminary exam… it's difficult to say definitively. It could be a number of things. But given the slurred speech and the weakness… and frankly, the vague recollection of your medical history… I'm concerned about the possibility of a neurological event. I want to order an MRI of your brain to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A neurological… event? And an MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is something wrong with my brain? What does that even mean? I… I don’t understand. What are you suspecting? And… will it hurt? Is it expensive? I have Medicare, but… will it cover it?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Swaby, it's too early to jump to conclusions. An MRI is a diagnostic tool, that’s all. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on in your brain. As for what I suspect… I’m not going to speculate. It could be a number of things, from a minor issue to something more significant. As for the cost, that’s something you'll need to discuss with Medicare. I will write the order for the scan, and you can schedule it at the imaging center. I also want you to avoid driving until we have the results. And… try to get some rest. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not really. It’s just… a lot to take in. My brain… and scans… and not driving… Will my husband be able to come with me to the scan? I get very nervous in hospitals. And… how long will it take to get the results? Is it… is it likely to be something bad? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, but… I’m just very worried.
DOCTOR: Yes, your husband can accompany you. And the results typically take 24 to 48 hours. As for whether it’s “something bad”… frankly, Mrs. Swaby, that's impossible to say at this point. Worrying won't help. We need to gather more information. I’m writing the order now. Here’s the number for the imaging center. Schedule the scan as soon as possible. And… try to relax. Now, do you have any other practical questions?
