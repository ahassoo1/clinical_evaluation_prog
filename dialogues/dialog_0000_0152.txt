DOCTOR: Alright, Chelise, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Good morning, Doctor Batara. It’s nice to meet you. I’m a little worried about this cholesterol thing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Worried, are we?
PATIENT: Well, yes. My mom… she had problems with that, with her cholesterol, and it wasn’t good. So, when the tests came back… I just get a little anxious, you know? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Anxiety won't give you high cholesterol, dear, but it won't help either. We need to look at the numbers, of course. Let's start with the basics. Have you been diagnosed with high cholesterol before, or is this the first time you’re hearing about it?
PATIENT: No, never before. This is the first time. I had a check-up with my regular doctor last month, just a routine thing, and she called to say some numbers weren’t right. She said I should see someone who specializes in… well, I guess, things like this. She didn’t explain much, just said it was “hyperlipidemia” or something like that. Does that mean anything bad?
DOCTOR: "Hyperlipidemia." Yes, it simply means high cholesterol. It’s… descriptive. Don't let the fancy word frighten you. Now, do you know which numbers were off?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. She just told me to make an appointment with someone like you. I remember her saying something about “LDL” and “HDL” but honestly, it all went over my head. I'm not good with medical stuff. I just know numbers should be… lower, I think? And she was a bit rushed, to be fair. It was Friday afternoon, and she had a waiting room full of people.
DOCTOR: Friday afternoons. Always a rush. Right. Well, we'll find out what the numbers are. Let's pull up your records here… Ah, yes. LDL 165, HDL 35, Triglycerides 210, Total Cholesterol 250. Not…ideal. Have you ever had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? I don’t think so. I feel fine, actually. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I’ve been doing a lot of gardening this summer, so I figured it was just that. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… nothing like that. Is that normal, to not feel anything?
DOCTOR: Perfectly normal, unfortunately. That's the trouble with this particular condition. It's a silent one. You can feel perfectly fine while it's quietly causing…problems. Now, let's talk about your habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband, God rest his soul, he tried, but I always hated the smell. And I don't drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe on the weekends. I try to eat pretty healthy, lots of vegetables. I really do enjoy my garden, so fresh produce is easy to come by. What kind of problems could it cause if I don’t… fix it?
DOCTOR: “Fix it.” It’s not a broken appliance, dear. We’re talking about your cardiovascular system. Untreated hyperlipidemia… well, it leads to plaque buildup in your arteries. Narrowing. Reduced blood flow. Heart attack. Stroke. Things you definitely want to avoid. Now, family history – did your mother have heart disease?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. She had a heart attack when she was 72, and she had a stroke a few years after that. It was… quick. That's why I'm so worried, honestly. She wasn't very healthy, though. She smoked for years, and she loved her sweets. I've always tried to be better about those things, but… is it still likely to happen to me, even if I take care of myself?
DOCTOR: Genetics play a role, of course. A significant role. You’ve inherited a predisposition. We can’t change your genes, but we can manage the risk. Let’s talk about diet again, specifically. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some berries and a little bit of honey. Lunch is often a salad with chicken or fish – I try to get a lot of protein. Dinner varies. Sometimes it’s grilled salmon with roasted vegetables, other times it’s a pasta dish, but with whole-wheat pasta and lots of vegetables. I do love pasta, I admit. And I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, almost every night. Is dark chocolate bad?
DOCTOR: “Is dark chocolate bad?
PATIENT: Well, my regular doctor said a little bit of dark chocolate was okay. Something about antioxidants. But if it’s bad… I can give it up! I really don’t want to end up like my mother, you know? What else can I do? Besides avoiding chocolate, of course. Should I be exercising more? I do a lot of gardening, but is that enough?
DOCTOR: Gardening is…pleasant. It’s not cardiovascular exercise. You need more vigorous activity. At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Brisk walking, jogging, swimming. And you need to be mindful of saturated and trans fats in your diet. Red meat, processed foods… they contribute to the problem. Now, have you ever been on any medications for high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been very healthy, thankfully. Blood pressure is always good when I go to the doctor. And my blood sugar is always normal. It’s just this cholesterol thing. It’s… frustrating. So, no red meat, less pasta, more exercise… and no chocolate. Sounds…challenging. Do you think I need medication, though? Is it possible to get it under control with just diet and exercise?
DOCTOR: That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is! I really don't want to take medication if I can avoid it. I've always been afraid of side effects. What are the chances that diet and exercise will be enough? And if it doesn't work, what kind of medication are we talking about? Is it something I'll have to take for the rest of my life?
DOCTOR: Honestly?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I can handle the truth, Doctor. I just want to know what I’m up against. I don’t want any surprises down the road.
DOCTOR: With your family history and your current numbers… the odds of getting it under control solely with diet and exercise are…slim. Statins are the most common medication. They lower your LDL cholesterol. Yes, you’d likely need to take them long-term. There are side effects, muscle aches being the most common. But they are generally well-tolerated. We can monitor you closely, adjust the dosage if needed. Let's start with a trial of lifestyle changes for three months. Strict diet, regular exercise. Then we’ll recheck your numbers. If they haven’t improved significantly… we’ll discuss starting a statin. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds…reasonable. Three months, strict diet and exercise, and then re-check. And if it doesn't work, we talk about medication. Muscle aches… that doesn't sound pleasant. But I understand. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I guess. Do you have any handouts about diet or exercise that I could take with me? Or maybe a website you recommend? And what kind of exercise is best? I don’t want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a very basic guide to heart-healthy eating. As for exercise… brisk walking is a good start. Aim for at least 150 minutes per week. Don't push yourself too hard, especially at first. And stay hydrated. Honestly, just move. Gardening doesn't count. I'll also have the nurse print out a website with more information. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, even if it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to hear. I’ll start working on the diet and exercise right away. And I’ll see you in three months. I really appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: See that you do. Don't wait until you're having chest pain to take this seriously. Three months. And don't eat the chocolate.
