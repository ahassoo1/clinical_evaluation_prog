DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 41 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. Forty-one, nearly forty-two, actually. It's… well, it’s my weight. I've gained quite a bit recently, and I haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise. It's rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes. Weight fluctuations can be concerning. And you say this has occurred without any changes to your usual diet or activity level?
PATIENT: Precisely. I eat the same things, approximately the same portions, and I walk every day – usually about thirty minutes, give or take, depending on the weather. My husband, Tomas, says I’m being dramatic, but I feel different, too. More tired, a little… sluggish. It's not just the number on the scale, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and sluggishness… those are relevant details. It’s good you’re paying attention to how you feel, Ms. Selbitschka, not just the weight. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My skin seems drier, I suppose. And I’ve been… colder, even when the weather isn’t particularly cool. Oh! And my hair… it’s shedding more than usual. It’s all rather bothersome. I don’t know if any of that is connected, of course. It just all started around the same time as the weight gain.
DOCTOR: Dry skin, feeling cold, increased hair shedding… These could be related. Let’s get a more comprehensive picture. Do you have any family history of thyroid problems, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had something with her thyroid, I believe. She was always very tired, and she gained a lot of weight. She needed… medication, eventually. I don’t recall the specifics, I was quite young. As for autoimmune conditions… not that I’m aware of. No one ever talked about such things. My family isn't one for discussing illness.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of thyroid issues is pertinent. And you've not experienced any other symptoms – changes in your bowel habits, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. Everything is… regular, if you’ll pardon my bluntness. I haven't noticed anything unusual in that regard. Just the weight, the tiredness, and everything else we've discussed. It's truly baffling. I haven't altered my routine at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we proceed further, let's review your current medications and any allergies you may have. Do you take any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Tomas offers me vitamins sometimes, but I rarely take them. I prefer to get my nutrients from food. And no allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything. That is, could eat anything, before this… began.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your thyroid gland, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you deem necessary. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I simply want to understand what is happening and, hopefully, find a solution. It's rather unsettling to feel as though your body is… changing without reason.
DOCTOR: Quite right. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Again… Sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. Hmm… the thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there’s a small nodule on the left lobe. It doesn’t feel particularly concerning at this stage, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh… that is a little… sensitive. But yes, go ahead. I understand it’s necessary. Is that enlarged thyroid what could be causing everything? The weight, the tiredness… everything? I confess, Doctor, I’m quite worried. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Ms. Selbitschka. An enlarged thyroid, particularly with a nodule, can certainly contribute to the symptoms you’re describing – the weight gain, fatigue, dry skin, hair shedding. However, it’s premature to make a definitive diagnosis at this stage. We need to order some blood tests to assess your thyroid hormone levels. Specifically, we'll check your TSH, T4, and T3. We may also want to consider a thyroid ultrasound to get a better look at the nodule. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an ultrasound. No, I don’t think so. Those sound… thorough. Will the blood tests require fasting? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a commitment next week that I’d rather not reschedule, if possible. It's a… family event.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for eight to twelve hours before the blood draw. No food or caloric beverages. Water is permitted. As for the results, it typically takes about three to five business days for the lab to return them. I can have the lab technician expedite the process, but it's not always guaranteed. I’ll also order the ultrasound for you, and the scheduling department will contact you directly to arrange an appointment. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, should the ultrasound require it?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to dye that I'm aware of. My mother used to have some imaging done, and I never recall her mentioning any problems. Water is fine, of course. Eight to twelve hours… I can manage that. Three to five days… that’s acceptable. I suppose we just wait, then. Is there anything else I need to do, Doctor? Or anything I should be aware of while we wait for the results?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Selbitschka, there's nothing specific you need to do at this time. Continue your usual routine, but avoid any strenuous activity until we have a better understanding of the cause of your symptoms. I'll contact you as soon as the results are available to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Here’s the lab requisition form and the referral for the ultrasound. The receptionist will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. I hope we can find an answer soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. We’ll be in touch.
