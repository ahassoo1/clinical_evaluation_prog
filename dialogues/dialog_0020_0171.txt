DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... Beinborn, you say? Right. Um, my nails. They just... look funny. Not good funny. They been like this a bit now, I think. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, your nails. And how long have they "been like this a bit now"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A bit... maybe a month? Two? Time just... goes. I don't keep track. They're not hurting or anything, just... different. Kind of yellow-ish and thick, I guess. Not a pretty color, let me tell you. I always have nice hands, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow-ish and thickened nails, for about a month or two. No pain. Have you noticed any changes in the texture of the skin around your nails, or any crumbling or splitting?
PATIENT: Splitting? Crumbling? Oh, no, not really. I put lotion on, sometimes. When I remember. They just… look off. Like someone painted them with cheap polish, but I don't wear polish. And I don't know what 'texture' even means when you're talkin' about skin. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Texture just refers to how the skin feels – rough, smooth, bumpy. Don't worry about it if you haven’t noticed anything specific. We're just gathering information. Now, have you noticed any other changes, anywhere else?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm. Well, my knees ache a bit when it's cold. But that's just… old age, I reckon. And I’ve been a bit tired lately. But who isn't tired, these days? Honestly, I don't think that's got anything to do with my nails. You think it's somethin' serious? I hope not.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned the knee pain and fatigue. We’ll definitely keep those in mind. It's unlikely to be something serious, but it’s important to have a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, dear. Let me think. I had a bad cold last winter, but that’s about it. And I used to get migraines, years ago. Not anymore, though. Mostly, I just try to stay out of the sun and not bother anyone. Does high blood pressure count? My sister has that, so maybe I do too? I don't really go to the doctor much. They always fuss over nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of migraines and a family history of high blood pressure. We can certainly check your blood pressure today. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. I like sweets, but I don't eat that many. Cakes and cookies, you know. The normal things. Not like… piles and piles of sugar. My mama always said too much sugar is bad for your teeth. I don’t feel sick or anything. Is that what people do when they have that... diabetes?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. Many people with early diabetes don’t feel sick. Some common symptoms are increased thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss, but not everyone experiences those. Do you experience either of those?
PATIENT: Thirst? Well, it's been hot lately, hasn't it? I drink water when I remember. And urination… Well, that’s a private matter, isn’t it? I go to the bathroom like everyone else. And weight loss? No, I’ve probably gained weight. Honestly, this is a lot of questions about nothin', don't you think? Is my nail really that bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It may seem like a lot of questions for a nail issue, but we like to be thorough and rule out anything underlying. I just want to make sure we're not missing anything. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Um… I take a little something for my knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think? When they really hurt. And I had some vitamins after that cold last winter, but I think I threw them out. They tasted awful. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy. Just the basics, really. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's just from the dust. And I don't like shellfish, but that's 'cause it tastes funny, not 'cause I get sick. Honestly, I'm pretty sturdy. I've never had a real allergy, not like those people on TV. Is this gettin' somewhere? I was hopin' to get this sorted out quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to take a look at your nails and check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Get it over with, then. Just be quick about it. My knees are startin' to ache. And please don't poke too hard. They're sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let's just take a look at your nails. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your nails are quite yellow and noticeably thickened. I don't see any signs of infection currently, but the texture is abnormal. Any pain with this light touch?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little. Not bad, but… yeah, that's tender. See? I told you they were sensitive. What does that mean? Is it somethin' serious? Is it somethin' I caught? Do I need to tell my sister? She always gets everything I get.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on palpation. It’s good you mentioned your sister. The most common cause of thickened, yellowed nails is a fungal infection, called onychomycosis. It’s not usually serious, but it can be contagious, so it’s good to be mindful of that. It's possible you transferred it to your sister, but it's also possible she's simply susceptible. To confirm this, we can do a simple nail clipping test to look for the fungus under a microscope. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A fungus? Like… mold? Oh, dear. That sounds awful. And a test? You're gonna cut my nails? I just had them done... well, not done, exactly, but they were nice. I don't like the sound of this at all. Is there somethin' else we can do? Cream? Pills? Anything but cuttin' them! Honestly, I think I'll just live with it. It's just nails, after all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. Cutting a small portion of the nail is the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis, but we can explore other options. Topical treatments are available, but they often have limited effectiveness, especially with thicker nails, and can take a very long time to show results – sometimes a year or more. Oral medications are more effective, but they do have potential side effects and require monitoring. Given your preference, we can start with a topical antifungal medication and see if that provides any improvement. However, it's important to understand that it may not be as effective as other treatments. Would you like me to write you a prescription for that?
PATIENT: Topical... that sounds better. Less cuttin'. A year? Oh, no. I won't be around in a year! Alright, alright. Write me the prescription. As long as it doesn't involve any pokin' or proddin'. And it better not smell bad. I can't stand strong smells. Now, can I go? My knees are really achin' now.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll write a prescription for a topical antifungal medication, specifically efinaconazole, which is relatively odorless. I'll also include instructions on how to apply it properly. It's important to file the nail down regularly to help the medication penetrate and to keep the area clean and dry. Here's the prescription. If you don't see any improvement after 8-12 weeks, or if the condition worsens, please come back, and we can discuss other options. And remember, keep the area clean and dry, and file your nails regularly. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just... try not to cut 'em, okay? And thank you, I suppose. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I hope the medication helps. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Lacreasha. .
