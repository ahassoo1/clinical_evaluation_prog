DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Amussen. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping for a bit of a… a fresh start, you could say. I feel like I need a jumpstart to get my health back on track. It’s not one specific thing, just… generally feeling worn down.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Worn down” is a good way to put it. It's great you're being proactive about getting things checked out. To help me get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about how you’re feeling worn down?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly… I sleep, but don’t always feel rested, if that makes sense? And my energy levels… they fluctuate quite a bit. Some days I feel alright, capable. Other days, even simple tasks feel exhausting. It's been going on for… well, I suppose a few months now, gradually worsening. I also find I’m not as… enthusiastic about things as I once was. It’s a bit disheartening, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue that isn't relieved by sleep, fluctuating energy, and a bit of a loss of enthusiasm… That's helpful. When you say "fluctuating," can you describe a typical day?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… Often, I wake feeling… not terrible, but not refreshed. I’ll manage the morning – getting ready, a bit of housework. But by early afternoon, I find myself needing to lie down for a bit. It's not a debilitating crash, more of a… a significant slowdown. Then, sometimes, I’ll have a burst of energy in the evening, but it’s unpredictable. And then, other days… the slowdown happens much earlier, and lasts longer. It’s… inconsistent, to say the least. It’s making it difficult to plan anything, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the fatigue is more pronounced in the afternoon, but not consistently. And it’s impacting your daily life. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question. Hmm… I've noticed that stress definitely makes it worse. Work can be quite demanding, and if I have a particularly difficult week, I feel completely depleted. As for things that make it better… honestly, not much consistently. A good night’s sleep helps, of course, but it’s rarely enough. And… being outdoors seems to lift my spirits a little, but it’s temporary. I do enjoy gardening, when I have the energy. Is that relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is relevant. Anything that gives you even a little bit of relief is important information. Okay, so stress worsens it, and gardening sometimes helps. Let's talk about your work a little more. What do you do, and would you describe it as physically demanding, mentally taxing, or both?
PATIENT: I work as a… well, it's a bit difficult to explain concisely. I'm a molder, shaper, and caster – but not with metal or plastic. I work with natural materials – clay, wax, some resins… creating sculptures and decorative items. It requires a lot of precision, and… well, it’s very detailed work. It’s mostly mentally taxing, I suppose, though I am on my feet a good portion of the day. And I do lift some heavier materials occasionally, but nothing overly strenuous. It’s the concentration, I think, that really drains me. It requires a lot of focus, and if I get interrupted, it’s difficult to regain my momentum.
DOCTOR: Okay, so detailed, focused work. That makes sense. It's good you've identified that as a potential factor. Now, outside of work, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good point to ask. Hmm… I haven’t been feeling quite myself physically either, though it's hard to pinpoint. I’ve had some… digestive issues, on and off. Nothing severe, just… discomfort. And I’ve been feeling a little more forgetful than usual, though I always attributed that to simply getting older! I wouldn’t say it’s alarming, but it’s noticeable. Also, my appetite hasn’t been quite the same. It fluctuates as well, strangely enough. Some days I’m ravenous, others I have very little interest in food. Is that… concerning, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, digestive issues, some forgetfulness, and fluctuating appetite… We're building a picture here. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question. Actually… yes. Not a significant amount, but I have lost a few pounds. Maybe five or so, over the past few months. I hadn't really connected it to everything else, I just assumed it was… well, I don't know. Perhaps due to the lack of appetite? It wasn't intentional, certainly. I do try to maintain a healthy weight, and I was quite stable before this all started. I am around 115 pounds, and I'm quite tall - nearly six feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds of unintentional weight loss with the decreased appetite… That's something we need to investigate further. I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, do. Ask whatever you need to. I want to understand what’s going on, and I’m happy to provide any information I can. I just… I’m hoping we can figure this out.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. As an adult, I’ve had the occasional cold or flu, but nothing that required extensive treatment. I did have some back problems a few years ago, but that was resolved with physical therapy. I don’t have any chronic conditions, and I haven’t been hospitalized for anything significant. I do see a specialist for my vision, as I am rather nearsighted, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Any past surgeries?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I've always been lucky in that regard. Never needed them, thankfully. I try to be careful, and I haven't had any major injuries that required surgical intervention. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a fairly routine procedure. Other than that, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, how about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a bit more complicated. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some heart problems later in life. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, was diagnosed with diabetes. Beyond that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. We weren’t very close, and medical information wasn’t really discussed. It’s something I wish I knew more about, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Hypertension, heart problems, and diabetes in the family. I’m going to move onto some lifestyle questions, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Please do. I understand that all these factors are important.
DOCTOR: Great. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never been a smoker, and I don’t use any tobacco products whatsoever. I find the habit quite distasteful, truthfully. My husband doesn’t smoke either, so we’ve always had a smoke-free home.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. How about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps a couple of times a week, but nothing excessive. I wouldn't say I drink heavily, and I certainly don't drink every day. It’s more of a social thing, really, or a way to relax after a long day. I don’t drink to excess, and I never drink and drive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never used recreational drugs, and I have no interest in doing so. I’ve always believed in living a healthy and responsible lifestyle, and that includes avoiding substances like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. One last quick question about lifestyle. Can you describe a typical day in terms of diet and exercise?
PATIENT: Certainly. My diet is… fairly healthy, I think. I try to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins. I enjoy cooking, so I usually prepare meals at home. We eat a lot of fish, chicken, and beans. I do enjoy sweets occasionally, but I try to limit my sugar intake. As for exercise… that's where I struggle a bit. I used to be more active, but with work, it’s become more difficult. I walk when I can, and I enjoy gardening, but it’s not a consistent routine. I probably don’t get enough exercise, truthfully. I’ve been meaning to join a gym, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle – I feel tired, so I don’t exercise, and then I feel even more tired…
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly healthy diet but inconsistent exercise. Before we move on to medications and allergies, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 122/80, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your respiratory rate is 16. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid is normal, no nodules or enlargement. Finally, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat and ears. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Ears are normal. Okay, everything seems normal on physical exam so far. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't. As far as I know, I have no allergies whatsoever. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies or environmental allergies. I can wear nickel jewelry without issue, and I haven't had a reaction to insect bites either. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don't take any regular medications. Occasionally, I'll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible, and I haven't had any chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment. I do take a daily multivitamin, but that’s more of a preventative measure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, fluctuating energy, weight loss, digestive issues, forgetfulness – and the normal physical exam, I think it’s important to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I want to check your complete blood count to rule out anemia or infection, your thyroid function to rule out thyroid problems, your vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We can also check your blood sugar to rule out diabetes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible to me. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them done. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment. It’s good to be thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to consider all the possibilities.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, I’m going to print out a lab requisition for you. You can take this to the lab, and they’ll draw some blood. It’s a fairly standard procedure, and it shouldn't take long. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I want you to continue to monitor your symptoms and note any changes. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or difficulty breathing, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds very clear, and I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I understand the next steps, and I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. I'll make an appointment at the lab tomorrow. Thank you for your time, Doctor Amussen. I feel much better having taken the first steps towards figuring this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. I’m glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
