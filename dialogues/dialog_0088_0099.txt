DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Minatra. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Piet. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An GI Endo Test, it was called. I’m a bit worried about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. An upper endoscopy, you mean?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. An upper endoscopy. I apologize for the incorrect terminology earlier. It’s just… well, medical words aren’t my strong suit. Would you mind explaining what the results showed? I received a summary, but frankly, it didn’t make much sense to me.
DOCTOR: Of course, no need to apologize at all. Medical jargon can be quite confusing. Let me pull up your records here… Okay, I see the report from July 15th. It does mention some findings. Before we get into specifics, can you tell me a little bit about why you had the endoscopy done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For the past few months, I've been experiencing a rather persistent discomfort in my stomach. It's not a sharp pain, more like… a burning sensation, and a feeling of fullness even after only eating a small amount. It also seemed to be getting worse, so my previous doctor suggested the test to investigate. He wanted to rule out anything serious, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning sensation and early fullness. And how long ago did this burning sensation start, roughly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began, oh, I’d say around February. It was mild at first, easily dismissed. But gradually, over the spring months, it became more noticeable and frequent. By June, it was interfering with my appetite, and that's when I decided to seek medical attention. I do try to eat regularly, but even small meals can cause discomfort now. It’s quite frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific seemed to trigger the discomfort?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything specific. Certain foods seem to exacerbate it – particularly anything acidic, like citrus fruits or tomatoes. And sometimes, if I lie down shortly after eating, it feels worse. But other times, it happens regardless of what I’ve eaten or when. It's been rather unpredictable, which makes it hard to manage. I've tried adjusting my diet, but haven’t noticed a dramatic improvement, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Occasionally, I've experienced a bit of nausea, but it's not severe, and it doesn’t happen often. And a few times, I’ve noticed a slight metallic taste in my mouth, but that could just be my imagination. Oh, and I’ve been feeling rather fatigued lately, although I attribute that more to my age, if I’m honest. I do try to stay active, gardening mostly, but I tire more easily than I used to. No weight loss, thankfully. I’m quite particular about my weight, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no weight loss is good. And no blood in your stool or vomit, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No blood in either, to my knowledge. I do check regularly, just to be sure. It's a habit I developed many years ago, and I’m rather diligent about it. I haven’t noticed anything concerning in that regard. I'm relieved it hasn't come to that, naturally. It would be quite distressing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years back, but it's well-managed with medication. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been careful about my diet and exercise, and I rarely drink alcohol. I’m not much of a drinker, you see. And I’ve never smoked. I lost my husband five years ago, and I believe keeping busy has helped me maintain good health, emotionally and physically.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and hypertension, well-controlled. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I am currently taking Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for about four years now, and my doctor assures me it’s working effectively. I have it delivered monthly, so I rarely run out. I also take a daily multivitamin, but that’s more of a precaution, you see. I try to get most of my nutrients from my garden, but I figure a little extra can’t hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a multivitamin. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. Not to medications, foods, or anything else, as far as I'm aware. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband, on the other hand, was quite allergic to bee stings, but I inherited none of those sensitivities, I’m pleased to say. I've always been rather careful about what I consume, and I avoid anything unfamiliar or potentially harmful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get back to the endoscopy report. It does show some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach, and there was a small hiatal hernia identified. Have you been told about the hiatal hernia before?
PATIENT: A hiatal hernia? No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I don’t recall my previous doctor mentioning anything about a hernia. What exactly is a hiatal hernia? Is it serious? I apologize for my ignorance, but I'm not familiar with medical terminology, as I mentioned earlier. I prefer clear explanations, if you wouldn't mind. It makes me feel much more at ease when I understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course, no apologies necessary at all. It’s my job to explain things clearly. A hiatal hernia happens when part of your stomach pushes up through an opening in your diaphragm – that’s the muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen. It's fairly common, especially as we get older. It can sometimes cause the symptoms you've been experiencing – the burning sensation and feeling full quickly. The report also indicates some mild esophagitis, which is inflammation of the esophagus. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: That… makes a little sense, actually. The stomach pushing up through the muscle. So, it’s not a… a dangerous condition, then? And the inflammation… is that related to the hernia, or something else? I'm trying to piece it all together. It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Could the inflammation be causing the metallic taste in my mouth? I’ve been rather bothered by that lately. And what about the treatment? Is there anything that can be done about it? I’m hoping it’s not something that requires surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break it down. It's not usually a dangerous condition, but it can be uncomfortable and cause these symptoms. The inflammation, or esophagitis, is often caused by acid reflux – stomach acid irritating the esophagus. The hiatal hernia can contribute to this because it makes it easier for acid to travel back up. The metallic taste could be related to the acid reflux, although it's not a classic symptom. It’s also possible it's something unrelated. We generally start with lifestyle modifications and medication. Surgery is rarely needed unless the hernia is very large or causing significant complications. I’m going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – PPI – to reduce the amount of acid your stomach produces. We’ll also talk about some dietary changes and things you can do to manage your reflux. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, thankfully. Medication and diet changes are much more appealing than surgery, certainly. A proton pump inhibitor… is that something I take every day? Are there any side effects I should be aware of? And what kind of dietary changes are we talking about? I do enjoy my gardening, and I like to cook with fresh ingredients, so I hope it won't be too restrictive. I'm willing to make adjustments, but I want to be prepared. And, if you wouldn’t mind, could you possibly write down the name of the medication? I sometimes forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. The medication is called Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, usually before breakfast. It does have potential side effects, although they are generally mild – things like headache, diarrhea, or nausea. Most people don’t experience any side effects at all. As for dietary changes, we want to avoid things that trigger acid reflux. That means limiting fatty foods, spicy foods, citrus fruits, tomatoes, chocolate, caffeine, and alcohol. Smaller, more frequent meals can also help, and avoiding lying down immediately after eating. And try to elevate the head of your bed a little bit – that can help prevent acid from flowing back up while you sleep. I’ll print out a handout with a more detailed list of foods to avoid and some tips for managing reflux. Does that sound like something you can manage?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds quite reasonable, Doctor. Avoiding certain foods and smaller meals… I can certainly incorporate those changes into my routine. Elevating the head of the bed… that's a good idea, I hadn’t thought of that. And I appreciate you writing it all down. It helps me to have something to refer back to. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with my questions. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what's going on and what I can do to address it. Now, how often should I take the Omeprazole? And should I continue taking my multivitamin?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. You should take the Omeprazole once a day, every day, for about four weeks. We'll reassess after that to see how you're doing. If your symptoms improve significantly, we might consider tapering the dose or stopping it altogether. As for the multivitamin, yes, you can continue taking it. It shouldn’t interact with the Omeprazole. It’s unlikely to hurt, and some people find it helps. I’m also going to order some blood work to check your vitamin B12 levels. Long-term acid suppression can sometimes lead to B12 deficiency. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Vitamin B12 levels… that’s thoughtful of you to check. It’s good to be proactive about potential side effects. No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been exceptionally helpful and informative. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. I will follow your instructions carefully and schedule a follow-up appointment for four weeks from today. Is there anything I should do if my symptoms worsen before then? And where would I schedule that appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. If your symptoms worsen before your follow-up, or if you develop any new symptoms – like difficulty swallowing or chest pain – please call the office right away. Don’t hesitate. You can schedule your follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out. She’s right there at the front desk. I’m glad I could help you feel more comfortable, Ms. Minatra. Remember, we're here for you. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor Piet. Thank you again for everything. I will definitely follow your advice. Have a wonderful day as well.
