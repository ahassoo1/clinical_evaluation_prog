DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest... feels funny. And heart... goes thump-thump. Blood pressure… wife says it’s high. She make me come. Always worry, that woman. Just want to get this over with, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” in your chest and a fast heartbeat, and your wife is concerned about your blood pressure. That's good she's looking out for you. We’ll definitely check that out. Can you tell me more about this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Not pain, exactly. More like… a squeezing. Like someone tightens a band around it. Happens when I get… upset. Or when I walk too fast. Little things make it happen, you know? I don't like it. And it makes me tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing sensation in your chest that comes and goes, especially with activity or stress, and it leaves you feeling very tired. That's helpful. Does the squeezing radiate anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What mean radiate? It just… stays there. In the chest. Sometimes… maybe a little in the shoulder. Left side. But not much. Mostly just… there. I don’t have time for this. Is it bad? Is it serious? My wife said something about… hospital. I don’t want hospital.
DOCTOR: "Radiate" just means does the feeling spread anywhere else. Okay, so it stays mostly in your chest, with maybe a little in your left shoulder. We need to investigate this to figure out what’s causing it, but let’s not jump to conclusions about the hospital right away. We’ll start with a thorough examination and some tests. First, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: History? What kind of history? I live in this country a long time. I work hard. That's my history! Oh… you mean… sick things? I had… something with my stomach, long time ago. Fixed it with… herbs. And the usual old man things, you know? Aches, pains. Nothing special. I don’t go to doctors much. Waste of time, mostly. My wife… she likes doctors too much. Always checking something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stomach issues in the past that were treated with herbs, and general aches and pains. You don’t usually see a doctor unless you have to. I appreciate you telling me that. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that stomach issue?
PATIENT: No. Never surgery. Too risky. And no… hospital, no. Just the stomach thing, long ago. Very briefly. Just a few days. Now, are we going to get this over with? I have errands. And my wife will be angry if I take too long. Always with the errands… always with the schedule. Can't a man just relax?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospital stays besides that brief stomach issue. We’re getting there. Now, regarding your family – are there any heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmph. My father… he worked very hard. Died old. I think. Mother… also worked hard. I don’t remember much about her sickness. No one talk about it. Lots of… cough, maybe. And my brother… he like to eat a lot of sweets. Maybe diabetes? I don’t know. We don’t talk about these things. It’s not polite. Now, can we please get to the tests? I’m starting to feel… funny. Again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some possible diabetes in your brother, but not much else known about family medical history. And you're starting to feel the chest discomfort again, I see. We’ll get to the tests shortly. Before we do, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Except… cilantro. That stuff taste like soap. Medications… I take one for my… water. The prostate. Small pill. And… that’s it. Never had problem with pill. Now, are you sure this will be quick? I really need to go. My wife made a special dinner. She’ll be upset if it gets cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies, and you take a medication for your prostate. Good to know. Just a few more questions, then we will move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Bad for you. Alcohol… maybe a small glass of rice wine with dinner. Sometimes. And drugs? What kind of question is that? I am a respectable man! I work hard, I provide for my family. I don’t need drugs! Honestly. This is ridiculous. Can we please just start the tests? My chest is getting worse. And I don't want to be rude to my wife when I get home.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. No smoking, occasional small glass of rice wine, and no drugs. I understand your frustration and I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, but it’s important for me to get a complete picture. Let’s proceed with the physical exam, then we can discuss some possible tests. If you feel any discomfort during the exam, please let me know immediately. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… I hear a slightly rapid heartbeat, and a very faint murmur. I’ll need to listen more carefully.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But hurry. This is uncomfortable. All these poking and prodding. And I feel… anxious now. My heart is always fast. I work hard. Of course it's fast! I told you. Just get it over with. I don’t like doctors. Never have. And my wife will… well, you don’t want to know. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’m being as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160/95. That’s higher than we’d like. I’m also going to check your pulse, and feel your abdomen. Your pulse is rapid, but regular. Your abdomen feels normal. I will also take a look at your lower extremities. I notice some slight swelling in your ankles.
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh. Yes. My wife says my ankles swell. She makes me put my feet up. Always telling me what to do. High blood pressure… I knew it. Always complaining. This is why I don't like going to the doctor. Just confirms what my wife already says. So, what now? Am I going to die? Is this serious? I have errands! And dinner… it’s getting cold, I just know it. Can we just get some medicine, and be done with this? My wife will be furious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’ve found elevated blood pressure, a rapid heartbeat, and some swelling in your ankles. Now, let's not jump to conclusions about dying or being furious. These findings are concerning, but treatable. Given your symptoms and these exam findings, I suspect we’re dealing with either hypertension, or early signs of heart failure. It's hard to say for sure without further testing. I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a complete blood count. I also want to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart, and a BNP blood test to help rule out heart failure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But hurry, please. I don't have all day. What does BNP even mean? And my wife... she’ll want to know all the details. All these big words... Is this going to be expensive? I have insurance, but… she handles that. Honestly, this is a disaster. I just wanted to get my chest checked. Not… all of this. Can I at least sit down? This standing is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely understand your frustration. Let me explain. BNP stands for B-type natriuretic peptide. It’s a blood test that can help us determine if your heart is under stress. If the level is elevated, it could indicate heart failure. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. The EKG is quick and painless – it just involves attaching some stickers to your chest. And the chest X-ray will only take a few minutes. And yes, absolutely, please sit down. The nurse will be in shortly. We will get through this. And I'll make sure to explain all the results clearly, and we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Questions? Ugh. Just… what if it is serious? What if I need… surgery? Or… I don’t even want to think about it. And my dinner… it’s probably cold by now. I just want to go home. Can’t I just take a pill? My wife has all sorts of pills. Maybe one of those will help. No. Don’t answer that. Just… get the tests done. And hurry. And please, tell my wife not to worry. She worries too much. That’s all. Just… hurry. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I won’t dismiss your concerns, and I assure you we’ll take everything one step at a time. I'll certainly tell your wife not to worry, and we will discuss everything thoroughly before making any decisions. The nurse will be in shortly to start the tests. Please let me or the nurse know if you feel any discomfort during the tests. .
