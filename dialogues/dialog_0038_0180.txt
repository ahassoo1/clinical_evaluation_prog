DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. I'm just...tired. Really tired. And I...eat dirt now, I guess. It's stupid, I know. Don't ask me why, I don't even know. Just…can we hurry this up?
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy, we can definitely work quickly. But it’s important I understand what’s going on to help you best. You said you’re really tired, and you’ve been eating dirt… how long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer? It’s hard to say. Things just…slowly got worse. I used to be able to work all day, now I nap after lunch every day. And the dirt…started maybe a few weeks ago? It's not like I'm choosing to do this, okay? It just…feels right. Does that make any sense? I don’t know why I'm telling you this. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It does make sense that you’re seeking help if something feels off, even if it’s hard to explain. And you're not alone in experiencing things that are difficult to put into words. We'll figure this out together. So, months of fatigue…is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much. Some days are worse than others, sure. But I always feel…drained. Like someone stole all my energy. And I get headaches. A lot of headaches. They don't come from anything, I just…get them. And I’m irritable, my neighbor keeps complaining. Honestly, I don’t blame him. But I can't even remember what I was doing yesterday half the time, it’s awful. Look, are we getting anywhere? I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're definitely getting somewhere. Constant fatigue, headaches, irritability, and some memory issues…that’s a lot to deal with. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life. Okay, let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you say headaches, where do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Ugh, everywhere. Mostly around my forehead, temples...sometimes in the back of my neck. It’s not a sharp pain, just…dull and constant. Like a weight. And it doesn't really go away with medicine. I've tried those over-the-counter things. Don't help. And the dirt…I crave it. Like, I need it. It's just…earthy, I don't know how to explain. .
DOCTOR: Okay, dull, constant headaches not relieved by medication…and this craving for dirt. It's good you're telling me everything, even if it feels strange. Has anything changed recently in your life – any major stresses, changes in your diet, new medications, or recent illnesses?
