DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Lakiya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s…painful. That is why I am here. I would like to be quick, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lakiya. We'll get right to it. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It is…in my back. Lower back. It started…about a week ago, I think. It’s not…sharp, exactly. More like a dull ache. It gets worse when I bend over, or…when I lift things. Which is bad, seeing as my job is…fences.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that started about a week ago, described as a dull ache, worsened by bending and lifting. And you work with fences – that involves a fair bit of physical activity, I imagine. Can you tell me on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you've ever felt, what number would you give your pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? …Maybe a six. It isn’t constant, but when it is there…it’s a solid six. It makes it hard to…focus. And it worries me, because I need to work.
DOCTOR: A six when it’s present – alright. And it’s interfering with your ability to focus and work, which is understandably concerning. Does the pain radiate anywhere – like down your legs, or into your hips?
PATIENT: Yes. It goes down my left leg, sometimes. Not all the way to my foot, but…down the back of my thigh. And my hip on the left side feels…tight. Like a knot. It’s not always there, but when the back pain is bad, the hip bothers me, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain radiates down your left thigh, and you’re experiencing some tightness in your left hip that seems to correlate with the back pain. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: When I sit still, it helps a little. And…warm water. A hot shower, or a warm compress. It doesn’t take it away, but it eases it. Otherwise…not much. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain pills, but they didn’t do a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, sitting and heat provide some relief, and over-the-counter pain relievers haven't been very effective. Now, just to get a better picture, have you had any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No numbness or tingling. Just…the ache. And the tightness. My left leg feels…heavy sometimes, when the pain is bad. But not numb. Just…heavy. It feels like it could give out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, but a sensation of heaviness in your left leg, particularly when the pain is worse. That's good to know. Have you had any back problems before – any injuries, surgeries, or ongoing pain?
PATIENT: No. Never any injuries to my back. No surgeries. This is…new. I’ve always been strong. I work hard. This is…unexpected. My husband…he used to help me with things, but…he’s gone now. I haven’t had anyone to help me with things since.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lakiya. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. It's definitely frustrating when something new like this comes up, especially when you're used to being self-sufficient. Now, let's talk about other medical issues. Do you have any other health problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I get Medicare, so they check me up sometimes. They haven’t said anything about…any of those things. I try to eat right. I walk when I can. Just…this back pain. It’s really the only thing bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions, and you're generally healthy aside from this back pain. And you mentioned Medicare check-ups – that's good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain pills, like I said. Ibuprofen. They didn’t help much, so I stopped taking them. And sometimes a multivitamin. But that’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, just ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Now, just a few quick questions about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My husband…he had allergies. But I don’t. I’m very lucky, I suppose. Except for this pain. It feels like it will never go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Right, well, Lakiya, it sounds like you've got lower back pain radiating down your left leg, some tightness in your left hip, and it's interfering with your work and daily life. It's not improving with over-the-counter pain relief. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have fences to fix.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. If you could lie down on your back on the table, that would be great. I'm going to start by just gently feeling along your spine and the muscles in your back to check for tenderness and spasms. Then, I’ll check your range of motion and do a few neurological tests – just to see how your nerves are functioning. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds…fine. I will lie down. Just…be gentle. It hurts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Lakiya, I'm just feeling along your spine now. Can you tell me if you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. There. On the left side. Lower, lower. Right there. That hurts. Not…sharp, but a dull ache. Like a bruise. And…when you press there…it goes down my leg a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that tenderness on the left side of your lower back, and you’re right, it seems to radiate down your leg with pressure. I also notice some muscle spasm on the left side. Now, I’m going to have you gently bend forward, keeping your legs straight. Just as far as you comfortably can. Let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: It hurts. When I bend over. It’s…a tight feeling. Like something is blocking me. And the pain goes down my leg more. I can’t go very far. It’s…too painful. It’s like a knot in my back. That’s the best way I can explain it. A very tight knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and increased pain with forward flexion. That makes sense. Now, I'm going to have you lie on your side, with your knees bent. I will gently lift your top leg to test your hip range of motion and assess for any pain. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes. I am lying on my side now. Lift my leg…gently, please. It hurts a little when you lift it. Not…bad, but I feel it. In my hip. And a little bit in my back. The left side. The same left side that hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some discomfort with hip flexion on the left side. Now, I’m going to straighten your leg and lift it up slowly. Just let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. This will help me check your nerves.
PATIENT: Yes. That’s…that’s the pain. Down my leg. When you lift it straight. It’s like…an electric shock. Not…strong, but I feel it. Definitely down my left leg. I don’t like that feeling. It makes my foot tingle a little bit, now. Very faint. But it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm stopping there. That’s good to know. And I'm noting the radiating pain down your leg with the straight leg raise and the faint tingling in your foot. I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes and sensation in your legs now. This is just to make sure everything is functioning normally. Okay, Lakiya, based on the examination, it appears you have some tenderness and muscle spasm in your lower back, particularly on the left side. The pain radiates down your leg with certain movements, and you experienced radiating pain and faint tingling with the straight leg raise test. Your reflexes and sensation are intact, thankfully. This is suggestive of a possible lumbar radiculopathy, which means irritation or compression of a nerve root in your lower back. It’s likely causing the pain down your leg. It could be caused by a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or other issues.
PATIENT: A…herniated disc? That sounds…serious. Is that something I need surgery for? I need to fix fences. I can’t be laid up in a hospital bed. This is…bad. Very bad. What do I do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Lakiya. A herniated disc can be serious, but it doesn't always require surgery. In fact, most people with a herniated disc improve with conservative treatment. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to order an MRI of your lower back. That will allow us to see the discs and nerves and confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend the following: Rest: Avoid activities that aggravate your pain, such as heavy lifting and bending. Ice/Heat: Apply ice for the first 24-48 hours, then switch to heat. Over-the-counter pain relief: Continue taking ibuprofen or naproxen as directed, if you can tolerate them. Physical therapy: I'm going to write you a prescription for physical therapy. A therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. We'll review the MRI results together and discuss the best course of action. If conservative treatment isn't effective, we can consider other options, such as injections or, in rare cases, surgery. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI…and physical therapy. Yes. That sounds…okay. Better than surgery, I suppose. Will the MRI tell me if I can still fix fences? That’s what I need to know. Can I still work? And…how long will this take? I have bills to pay. Will Medicare cover the MRI? This is…a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Those are very important questions, Lakiya, and I want to address them. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of the structures in your back and help us determine the cause of your pain. It will help us understand if your pain is likely to improve with conservative treatment and what activities you might need to avoid or modify. It won’t necessarily tell us a definitive ‘yes’ or ‘no’ about fixing fences, but it will give us much more information to make an informed decision. Yes, Medicare should cover the MRI. We'll submit the necessary paperwork, but you may have a co-pay or deductible. Our billing department can help you with any questions about costs. As for how long this will take, it's difficult to say definitively. Most people with a herniated disc improve within a few weeks to a few months with conservative treatment. Physical therapy can help speed up the recovery process. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. I want to get you back to work as soon as it's safe and reasonable to do so. I'll write you the prescriptions for the MRI and physical therapy, and I'll have the nurse schedule the MRI appointment for you. We’ll follow up in about a week to review the results and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just…schedule the MRI as soon as possible. And…thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s…a relief to know what might be wrong. I’ll go home and…try to rest. And I’ll call if the pain gets worse.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. I'm glad I could help. We'll get that MRI scheduled as quickly as possible. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescriptions and schedule the appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if the pain does get worse, or if you have any other concerns. Take it easy, and try to rest. We'll get this figured out.
