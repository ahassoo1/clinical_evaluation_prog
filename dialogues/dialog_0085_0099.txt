DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I received a letter regarding some tests I had done… a GI Endo Test, it was called. And the results, they weren't quite what I was hoping for, so I thought I best come in and discuss them with a professional. I must admit, I am a little anxious about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Denis. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're waiting on test results, especially when you've received a letter indicating something wasn't quite right. We’ll go through everything together, step by step. Just to clarify, was this test done here at the clinic, or at another facility?
PATIENT: It was done at St. Jude’s Hospital, Doctor. About three weeks ago, I believe. A specialist referred me after I’d been experiencing some… discomfort, shall we say. It wasn’t a sudden thing, more of a gradual worsening over several months. I remember they used a camera… a long, thin one. Is that what an Endo Test is? I apologize, I don’t always remember the proper names for things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Denis. It’s my job to help clarify things. Yes, an Endoscopy – or Endo Test as you correctly remembered – involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached, which is used to view the inside of your digestive tract. Okay, I’m pulling up the report now from St. Jude’s. It looks like Dr. Ramirez performed the procedure. And you said this discomfort has been gradually worsening over several months?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Dr. Ramirez was very thorough, a kind man. And yes, it has been gradual. At first, it was just a bit of… indigestion, really. I thought perhaps I was eating something that didn’t agree with me. But it slowly became more frequent, and… more troublesome. Now, it’s almost a daily occurrence, and it’s starting to interfere with my appetite. I’ve lost a little weight, I believe, but I haven’t been keeping precise track. Perhaps two or three pounds.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, it started as occasional indigestion and has progressed to almost daily discomfort, impacting your appetite and resulting in some weight loss. Can you describe the discomfort for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… burning sensation, mostly in my upper abdomen. It sometimes radiates to my back, but not always. And it’s often worse after I eat, particularly if I’ve had anything spicy or acidic. I’ve tried avoiding those things, but it doesn’t always seem to make a difference. Sometimes it feels like… pressure, a fullness that won’t go away, even when I haven’t eaten much. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Denis. You're describing a burning sensation in your upper abdomen, sometimes radiating to your back, worsened by certain foods, and accompanied by a feeling of fullness. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this discomfort?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. I have been feeling rather… fatigued lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And my… well, my stool has been a bit… darker than normal, I suppose. Not black, exactly, but… a very deep brown. I haven't paid much attention to it before, if I’m honest. It’s not something one generally discusses. And… occasionally, I experience a bit of nausea, but I haven’t actually been sick. Just a queasy feeling. I suppose that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, darker stools, and occasional nausea alongside the abdominal discomfort. Thank you for sharing all of that, Denis. It’s all very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’m generally quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve always been a strong woman. However, about ten years ago, I was diagnosed with… high blood pressure. It was mild, and my doctor at the time put me on medication. I’ve been taking it regularly ever since, and it’s been well-controlled, as far as I know. Other than that… nothing significant. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, but nothing major. My late husband… he had a touch of arthritis in his knees, but I don’t believe it’s hereditary. Is there anything specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. High blood pressure managed with medication is important information. And no other significant medical history is also helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, actually. When I was quite young, perhaps ten or twelve years old, I had my appendix removed. It was a fairly routine procedure, nothing complicated. And… about twenty years ago, I was briefly hospitalized for a severe bout of pneumonia. I was very ill for a few weeks, but I made a full recovery. Other than those two instances, I haven’t required hospitalization or surgery. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I try to take good care of myself. Is that the sort of information you need, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of information I need. Appendectomy as a child and pneumonia twenty years ago. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or digestive issues?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question, Doctor. My family… they weren’t always forthcoming about these things. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t have much information about her side of the family. My father… he was a stoic man, not one for discussing illnesses. However, I do recall my aunt, my father’s sister, she suffered from… stomach ulcers when she was younger. She required treatment for them, but I’m not sure what kind. And… my cousin, my father’s nephew, he was diagnosed with colon cancer a few years ago. He’s undergoing treatment now, but I haven’t spoken to him directly since his diagnosis. It’s a rather… sensitive topic. Does that help, Doctor? I apologize for not being more informative.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Denis, and I understand it's a sensitive topic. History of stomach ulcers in an aunt and colon cancer in a cousin are important to know. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My late husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I never cared for it myself. And… recreational drugs are simply not something I’ve ever been interested in. I’ve always believed in living a clean and healthy life. I eat a balanced diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I try to get regular exercise, although my arthritis does make it a bit difficult at times. I enjoy gardening, it’s very therapeutic. I find it keeps me active, both mentally and physically. Is there anything else you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Denis. A healthy lifestyle with a good diet and regular exercise is wonderful. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I trust your judgment completely. I understand it is necessary. I will do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything specific you would like me to do. I do have a rather sensitive back, due to the arthritis, so if you could be gentle… but I’m sure you already knew that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I did see a note about your arthritis. We’ll definitely take it easy and be gentle. Alright, let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now I’m going to palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness or masses. I’ll start gently, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: It’s… a little tender, Doctor, in the upper middle part. Right about here. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It’s been like that for a while now, as I mentioned earlier. It seems to worsen when you press on it. Just a little discomfort, nothing unbearable. But it is definitely there. Is that what you were expecting? I apologize if I’m being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being unhelpful at all, Denis. That's very helpful information. Tenderness in the upper middle abdomen is consistent with what you've been describing. Now I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, just to check for any unusual sounds. Sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Alright, that completes the basic physical exam. Everything else appears within normal limits. Based on your history and the exam, there are a few things I’m considering. It's good that we have the results from the GI Endo test. Do you happen to have a copy with you, or was it sent directly to St. Jude's?
PATIENT: I believe it was sent directly to St. Jude’s, Doctor. I don’t have a copy with me, unfortunately. I assumed they would forward it to my primary care physician, and then she would have shared it with me, but… I suppose that didn’t happen. I can certainly request a copy from them, if you would like. It may take a few days, but I’m happy to do so. I just don’t have it with me at the moment. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Denis. Getting a copy of the Endo test results is the next step. In the meantime, based on your symptoms – the upper abdominal discomfort, the fatigue, the darker stools, and the slight weight loss – and the findings from the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like gastritis or an ulcer, but we also need to rule out more serious conditions, such as gallbladder issues or even early signs of pancreatic problems. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your liver and pancreatic function, as well as check for any signs of inflammation. I'd also like to consider a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate that. If you believe those tests are necessary, then I wholeheartedly agree. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment completely. Blood tests and a stool test… yes, please. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again. It’s been rather unsettling, feeling so… tired and uncomfortable all the time. So, if those tests will help us figure out what’s going on, then I’m all for it. What will be involved? Will I need to fast before the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Good, I'm glad you feel that way, Denis. It's always best to be thorough. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We’ll provide you with a lab requisition form and detailed instructions when you leave. The stool test is a simple collection – you’ll receive a kit with instructions on how to collect a small sample. I'm also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any underlying anemia, which can sometimes cause fatigue. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss them and develop a more definitive plan. It's possible we'll need further imaging, like an ultrasound or CT scan, depending on what the tests show. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. Fasting for eight hours, a simple stool collection, and a CBC… I can certainly do all of that. I'm just relieved that we're taking steps to figure out what's going on. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel much more… hopeful now. An ultrasound or CT scan, if necessary… yes, I understand. I'll be happy to follow whatever plan you recommend. When can I expect to hear back with the results of the blood tests? And where should I go to have them done?
DOCTOR: Great. The lab is just across the street, at 123 Main Street. You can go any time during their regular business hours – 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. It usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. My office will call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You have answered all of my questions, and you have explained everything so thoroughly. I feel much more at ease now, knowing that we’re taking steps to address this. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. I truly appreciate it. I will go to the lab tomorrow morning and get the tests done. And I will be sure to contact your office if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. You have been a great help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns at all. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
