DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Smetak, was it? Yes, well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My daughter kept telling me I should get a check-up. Said I was getting “up there in years” and needed to make sure everything was still… working. I don’t really feel any different, but she worries.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of her, Ms. Calvery. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you’re feeling well. We'll do a general check-up, just to get a baseline and make sure everything is as it should be. Now, let’s start with a little bit of background. Could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmm. Well, I worked as a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades. Always on my feet, lots of stress, you know? I retired maybe ten years ago? Something like that. Before that… honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I don’t really have any big problems, not that I remember. My knees ache a bit sometimes, but who doesn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Calvery. Surgical tech is demanding work, certainly. A lot of physical activity and being on your feet. And it sounds like you've been relatively healthy overall. You mentioned your knees ache sometimes. Is that pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly when the weather changes, you know? Damp weather is the worst. And if I’ve been walking a lot. It’s not terrible, just… annoying. I take some over-the-counter stuff, those little orange pills… what are they called? I can never remember. They help a little.
DOCTOR: That’s common, Ms. Calvery. Weather can definitely affect joint pain. And it’s good you’ve found something that provides some relief. We can talk about those pills later, if you’d like. It’s helpful for me to know what medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones. Now, apart from your knees, are you experiencing any other aches, pains, or discomfort anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes my hands feel a bit stiff in the morning. But I always thought that was just from… well, from years of handling instruments. You know, delicate work. It doesn’t really bother me enough to do anything about it. I used to knit a lot, but I haven’t really had the energy lately.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Ms. Calvery. Years of intricate work can certainly lead to stiffness in the hands. And it's good you're aware of that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… not really. I eat when I’m hungry, don’t eat when I’m not. Always have been that way. As for weight… well, I’ve probably put on a few pounds since I retired. Not doing as much moving around, you know? My daughter keeps telling me I should watch it, but honestly, I don't fuss too much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s common for things to shift a bit with changes in activity level. Now, are you having any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Sleeping? Well… not really trouble, exactly. I just don’t sleep as much as I used to. I wake up a lot during the night. Usually just to… think. Or get a glass of water. It’s not a big deal, I’ve always been a light sleeper.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. It’s common for sleep patterns to change as we get older. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… difficult. I saw a doctor regularly when I was working, of course, for check-ups. But honestly, I don’t really remember being told I had anything serious. Maybe high cholesterol once? Or was that my husband? I always get those things mixed up.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s common to forget details over time. We can try to look it up in your records if you'd like. Do you happen to remember the name of your previous doctor, or the hospital you usually went to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The hospital… was it St. Luke’s? Or St. Joseph’s? They all blur together after a while. My doctor… Dr. Henderson, maybe? Or was that my dentist? I really can’t say for sure. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. Let's see if we can find anything in your electronic health record. It might take a moment… Okay, I see some information here. It looks like you were a patient at St. Luke’s, and your primary care physician for many years was Dr. Robert Henderson. It says here you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about fifteen years ago, and you were briefly treated for elevated cholesterol around the same time. Are you currently taking any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh! Dr. Henderson! Yes, that rings a bell. A very nice man. Hypertension… cholesterol… Well, that explains it. I am taking a little orange pill every day, I think for the cholesterol. My daughter makes sure I have it. Honestly, I just swallow whatever she gives me. She’s very good at looking after these things.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter, Ms. Calvery. It's very helpful to have someone assist with managing your health. Now, just to finish up with the medical history, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… and I think I had a small thing removed from my face, a mole or something. It was very minor, nothing to worry about. That was… goodness, a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a mole removal. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything. Maybe I was a little itchy once after eating shrimp, but it was probably just something else. My daughter is very careful about what I eat, she'd tell me if there was something I shouldn’t have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Ms. Calvery, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never liked the smell of it. My husband smoked a bit when he was younger, but I always made him go outside. It’s a nasty habit, really.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy, just something to relax. Not every night, mind you. Just on special occasions, or when my daughter comes over.
DOCTOR: Okay, and finally, Ms. Calvery, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, not really. I used to walk a lot more when I was working, just getting around. Now, I mostly just potter around the house. My knees aren't what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, limited exercise due to knee pain. Alright, Ms. Calvery, that gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle with my knees, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I will be very gentle. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Range of motion is slightly limited in your knees, as you mentioned. There is some mild crepitus with movement. Skin is warm and dry, no rashes or lesions. Alright, Ms. Calvery. Everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is a little high, and your knees do show some signs of wear and tear, which is not surprising given your history. I think we should start with some lifestyle modifications and possibly a medication adjustment to help lower your blood pressure. We can also discuss some physical therapy options for your knees. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Lifestyle modifications… I suppose I could try to walk a bit more, even if it’s just around the house. And the physical therapy… well, I’d have to think about that. I don't really enjoy being told what to do, you know? But if it will help my knees… maybe. As for the medication… whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We’ll take things at your pace. We can start with some simple walking exercises, and if that doesn't provide enough relief, we can discuss physical therapy in more detail. Regarding your medication, I think we can try increasing the dosage of your current cholesterol medication slightly. It often has a beneficial effect on blood pressure as well. I’ll write you a new prescription, and we’ll monitor your blood pressure closely over the next few weeks. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… um… well, will this new medication have any side effects? My daughter always worries about side effects. And… will I be able to still have my little glass of wine with dinner?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Calvery. It's good that your daughter is so attentive. Regarding side effects, the medication you're currently taking is generally well-tolerated, but some people can experience mild muscle aches or digestive upset. It's uncommon, though, and usually resolves on its own. We'll monitor you closely and if you experience any discomfort, we can always adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. And as for your glass of wine, moderation is key. One small glass of wine with dinner should be perfectly fine, as long as you don't experience any adverse effects. We want to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and completely restricting yourself isn't usually necessary or enjoyable. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that does, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve put my mind at ease. My daughter will be pleased to hear about the wine. She’s always telling me to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Calvery. It’s good to have someone looking out for you. So, to recap, we’re increasing your current medication dosage, encouraging gentle walking, and monitoring your blood pressure closely. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I must admit, I was a little worried coming in, but I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Calvery. That’s my goal – to make you feel comfortable and informed. Here’s the new prescription, and a pamphlet about healthy lifestyle modifications. My nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your glass of wine!
