DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. Well, it is… difficult to explain, really. The words… they do not come so easily now. It is frustrating, you understand? I am having trouble… finding the right words.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very frustrating when you feel like you can't express yourself properly. We'll take our time. So, this difficulty with finding words – has this come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Hmm… Gradual, I believe. Yes, gradual. It was not… one day, suddenly gone. More… slowly, over time. It is hard to say exactly when it began, you see. Perhaps… a few months ago? I am not very good with dates, I must confess.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about the exact dates. A few months, gradually worsening… okay. And is this difficulty with words constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days… better than others. When I am… tired, it is much worse. And if I am… trying to explain something complicated, it is very difficult. Simple things… usually okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with fatigue and when you're trying to articulate more complex thoughts. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. I… I sometimes feel a little… unsteady. Not falling, you understand, just… a bit off balance. And my memory… it is not what it used to be. But who remembers what they used to be, really? It is probably just my age, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness and some memory difficulties as well. It's good you're bringing these things up. While it could be related to age, it’s important to investigate further. Do you have any history of falls?
PATIENT: Falls? Not recently, no. But… a long time ago, when I was younger, I slipped on some ice. Hurt my… my hip, I think. It was many years ago, though. Does not feel relevant, surely?
DOCTOR: Okay, a hip injury many years ago. We'll make a note of that. And just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not really weakness, no. But… sometimes my legs feel… heavy. Especially at the end of the day. Like they are tired, you understand? It is hard to explain. It is not pain, not weakness… just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, heaviness in your legs, especially at the end of the day. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Now that you mention it… yes. Perhaps. Things do not seem as… bright, as they used to. And sometimes… a little blurry. But I have always needed glasses, you see. I thought it was just… the glasses needed adjusting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decrease in brightness and some blurriness. We’ll need to check your vision today. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes, I believe so. The doctor… many years ago, he told me I had it. I take… a small white pill, every morning. For that. And… I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. A flutter, they called it. But it was fixed, I believe. With… with a procedure. I do not remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous heart flutter that was treated with a procedure. Do you recall what kind of procedure it was?
PATIENT: No, no I do not. I really do not. It was… a long time ago. They put a… a tube inside me, I think? And… and I was in the hospital for a few days. But the details… they are very hazy. It was a very stressful time. I try not to think about it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can look into your records to get more information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I am aware of. I have never had a… a reaction to anything. I eat most things. I take the blood pressure pill, every day, as I said. And sometimes… a pain reliever, if I have a headache. But no… no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That is a difficult question. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. And I do not… I do not have much contact with my family. They live… far away. I know my mother… she had… something with her memory, when she was older. But I do not know the details. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you don’t need to feel pressured to recall details you don’t know. Knowing about your mother’s memory issues is helpful, though. Okay, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. I do not like smoking. Alcohol… sometimes, a small glass of wine with dinner. Very rarely, though. And… recreational drugs? Goodness, no. Never. I am a quiet man, you see. I prefer a good book.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. And do you live alone, or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: I live alone, yes. My wife… she passed away, as I said. I have… a neighbor, very kind woman, she checks on me sometimes. And my son… he calls every week. But mostly… I am alone.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. I'm going to check your neurological function now. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll test your strength and reflexes. Your strength is a little weaker than expected in your legs, and your reflexes are a little slow. Finally, I’m going to check your gait and balance. Please stand up slowly and take a few steps for me. Your gait is a little unsteady and you seem to require a bit of support. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue contributing to your symptoms. I think we need to do some further testing, including an MRI of your brain, and some blood work to rule out other possibilities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: MRI… and blood work? It sounds… serious. But if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then yes. Of course. Whatever you recommend. I trust you. What does it mean, though? What are you thinking it could be?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to rule out potential causes for your symptoms. Given the gradual onset of word-finding difficulties, memory problems, unsteadiness, and the findings on the neurological exam – the slight weakness and slow reflexes – we need to investigate possibilities like a stroke, a transient ischemic attack , or potentially a neurodegenerative condition. However, it’s very important not to jump to conclusions. The MRI and blood work will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. We’ll also need to review your medication list to make sure nothing is contributing to your symptoms. Do you have a list with you, or can you tell me all the medications you take?
PATIENT: Medications… Just the blood pressure pill, I think. A small white one. I take it every morning. I do not remember the name. I used to, but… I do not have a list with me, no. My wife… she used to keep track of all these things. But now… I struggle to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look up the medication based on your description. In the meantime, I’m going to order the MRI and blood work. The MRI will take about an hour, and the blood work should only take a few minutes. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available, so we can discuss them together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An hour… for the MRI? Will it be… uncomfortable? And… what if they find something… bad? I… I am a little afraid, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The MRI is generally a very safe procedure. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you'll need to lie very still, but it shouldn’t be painful. You’ll have headphones to help block out the noise, and a technician will be there with you throughout the procedure. As for what if they find something… bad, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. The purpose of the MRI is to gather information, and if we do find something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options and create a plan together. We have excellent neurologists here who specialize in treating these types of conditions. The important thing is that we're taking this seriously and are being proactive. Do you have anyone who can accompany you to the MRI appointment?
PATIENT: My son… he lives a few hours away. He is very busy. And my neighbor… she works during the day. No… I think I will have to go alone. But thank you for asking, Doctor. It is kind of you.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. The technicians are very experienced and will be there to assist you. We'll make sure you feel comfortable and safe. I'm going to give you a referral for the MRI and a list of instructions. The receptionist will help you schedule the appointment when you leave. I want you to know that I'm here to support you throughout this process. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today, once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving, operating heavy machinery, or making any important decisions until we know more. Also, if your symptoms worsen – such as increased difficulty speaking, weakness, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: A week… that seems a long time to wait. No… I do not think so. I am a little overwhelmed, I must confess. But I understand. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I will… try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I'll see you back here next week. The receptionist will help you schedule the follow-up and answer any questions you may have. Please, take your time getting out of here. And remember, we’re here to help.
PATIENT: .
