DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter from the lab... something about my cholesterol being high. Hyper... something? It scared me a little, to be honest. I don’t usually go to doctors unless something really feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, it's not a particularly pleasant sounding word, is it?
PATIENT: No, it’s not! Sounds very serious. I mostly eat healthy, I think. Lots of vegetables, not too much red meat… but I do love my cheese. And maybe a little too much butter on my bread. Does that kind of thing cause it? I’m not really sure what I should be eating, if anything.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Geho, it’s rarely one thing, is it?
PATIENT: No, I guess not. Everything in moderation, my mother always said. She was a very sensible woman. But she didn’t have high… that word… so I’m not really sure what to do about it. Is it something bad bad? I mean, will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: “Bad bad” is a rather… imprecise term, Ms. Geho. It can lead to problems, certainly. We need to look at the numbers, and then we'll discuss options. Have you ever had your cholesterol checked before?
PATIENT: I don’t think so, Doctor. Not that I remember. I’ve had regular check-ups, of course, but they mostly just check my blood pressure and… you know… the usual. They never said anything about my cholesterol being off before, not that I recall. I have a good memory, usually.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It doesn't appear to be documented in your prior records here. Alright. Let's start with a bit more detail about your diet. You mentioned vegetables and limiting red meat – good. But you also mentioned enjoying cheese and butter. How much cheese and butter would you say you consume in a typical week?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Cheese… probably about four or five slices, maybe? Sometimes more if I’m making a sandwich. And butter… I put it on my toast every morning, and I use it when I cook, probably a couple of tablespoons a day. Does that sound like a lot? I really do like butter! And good quality cheese, you know? Not that processed stuff.
DOCTOR: It's… not insignificant, Ms. Geho. And it's not just the quantity, but the type of fats as well. Let's move on to other aspects of your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Well, “regularly” is a strong word. I walk my dog, Winston, every day. He’s a big fella, a Newfoundland, so he needs a good walk, at least a mile. And I do a bit of gardening in the summer, weeding and planting things. But I wouldn’t say I “exercise” like those people on TV. No running or anything strenuous like that. Mostly just keeping active, you know?
DOCTOR: Keeping active is… positive. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it was awful. Horrible cough, always smelled terrible. No, definitely not a smoker. Never will be.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week. Nothing more than that. Usually a white wine, a Chardonnay or something. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Geho, based on what you’ve told me, and the lab results… it appears you do have elevated cholesterol. Now, we need to discuss what that means and what we can do about it. First, let's take a look at your physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then I’ll feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead. I’m a bit nervous now, to be honest. Is it really serious?
DOCTOR: It’s important to address it, Ms. Geho, but let’s not jump to conclusions. It's often manageable with lifestyle changes. Now, please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses. Everything seems within normal limits physically, aside from the blood pressure. Now, I’m going to order a more detailed lipid panel to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels. We'll also want to check your blood sugar and kidney function just to get a complete baseline. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A complete picture, you say? Good. I'd rather know everything, even if it’s not good news. So, more blood work then? Is that going to be painful? I don't love needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard blood draw, Ms. Geho. A small pinch, that’s all. We’ll send the sample to the lab and I’ll review the results when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on small, achievable changes to your diet. Reduce your intake of saturated and trans fats – think less butter, less cheese, and more lean protein and vegetables. And continue with the daily walks. I'm also noting a referral to a registered dietitian. They can provide personalized guidance on creating a heart-healthy eating plan. Does that sound helpful?
PATIENT: A dietitian, yes, that does sound helpful. I could definitely use some help with the eating plan. I always feel a bit lost when it comes to all the different foods. And I promise I’ll try to cut back on the butter and cheese. It’s going to be hard, but I will. When do you think the results will be back? And will someone call me when they are?
DOCTOR: The results typically take 2-3 business days. The lab will automatically forward them to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, I will document everything we discussed today, and we'll re-evaluate once the results are in. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it’s not wonderful news. I appreciate you not making me feel too worried.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Geho. It’s important to remember that high cholesterol is often manageable. We'll work through this together. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor Pitmon. Thank you again.
