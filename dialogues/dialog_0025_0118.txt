DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… well, it has to do with a… certification, I believe? It’s rather vague, truthfully. Something about needing to be re-certified for… work. Honestly, paperwork these days. It’s a nuisance. Do you handle that sort of thing here?
DOCTOR: A certification?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. I… work in healthcare, you see. Technical work, mostly. And something requires me to have my hearing and eyes checked regularly. It’s… rather bothersome, frankly. I seem to recall a form mentioning it specifically. Is this not where one gets such things done? I wouldn’t be here otherwise.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, we are a primary care practice. We handle medical health concerns. Not employment requirements. A hearing and vision check for work is… well, it's not exactly what we do here. Though I suppose I could do a basic screening, it won't be as thorough as a specialist. Are you experiencing any actual hearing or vision problems, or are you simply needing to fulfill a workplace obligation?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. I see. Well, that is inconvenient. I confess I assumed… one simply went to a doctor. Perhaps I misunderstood. A basic screening… yes, I suppose that would be… something. Though truthfully, I don't believe I've been having any particular difficulties. Just a bit of age, you understand. But if it's required, I suppose it's best to get it done. Do explain what this… screening entails.
DOCTOR: Very well. It's a simple test. I’ll check your ability to hear different tones at varying frequencies in both ears. Then I’ll assess your vision – distance and near sight, color perception, and basic visual fields. It’s not a comprehensive eye exam, mind you. Just a quick assessment to see if anything glaringly obvious is amiss. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I have them. Goodness, all of this seems… rather unnecessary. But if it must be done, let’s proceed. I suppose it’s better to have it over with quickly. Frequency, you say? Is that something I should be concerned about? I’ve never had my… frequencies tested before.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, “frequencies” simply refers to the pitch of the sounds I’ll be playing. It's a standard audiological measure. We're checking to see if you can hear sounds across the entire range that humans are capable of hearing. It's not something to be concerned about, it’s just what we do. Let’s start with your ears. If you’ll have a seat, I’ll explain the process as we go. We’ll do one ear at a time.
PATIENT: Very well. I must say, Doctor, you seem… rather exasperated with me. I assure you, I’m not deliberately trying to be difficult. It’s just that modern healthcare seems… exceedingly complicated. And I am a rather busy man, you understand. Proceed when you are ready. One ear at a time, you say? Is there a particular order? Perhaps the better ear first? Though, honestly, I haven't the slightest idea which one that would be.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t matter which ear we start with, Mr. Oriley. Honestly. I'm going to place these headphones over your ears. I’ll play a series of tones at different pitches, and I want you to indicate when you hear them, even if it’s very faint. Raise your hand when you detect a sound. Try to remain as still as possible during the test. Any background noise can interfere with the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Raise my hand when I hear a sound, remain still. It sounds… simple enough. Though I confess, I am rather sensitive to noises, you see. I live near a… particularly active bird population. They can be quite disruptive. Hopefully, your tones will be louder than chirping. Proceed when you are ready, Doctor. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with the right ear. Now, I'm going to play a tone… very faint, initially. Just tell me when you hear something. Do you hear anything yet?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all, Doctor. Just… silence. Or perhaps the faint hum of the… ventilation system. It’s difficult to say, truthfully. Are you certain this equipment is functioning correctly? Perhaps it’s… malfunctioning?
DOCTOR: It is functioning correctly, Mr. Oriley. What about now?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, I believe… yes, there’s a… faint ringing. Very faint. Almost like… a distant church bell. Or perhaps tinnitus? I do occasionally experience a slight ringing in my ears. Is that what you’re detecting? Or am I simply imagining things? It's quite difficult to say, truthfully. I hear something, yes. But whether it’s the tone or not… that’s another matter entirely.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you perceive a tone at… approximately 2000 Hz in the right ear, though you’re unsure if it's distinct from background noise or pre-existing tinnitus. <stage>continues the test, adjusting frequencies and volume, occasionally asking “Do you hear this?
PATIENT: Yes… no… perhaps… it’s very difficult to concentrate, Doctor. All these different tones… they all seem to blend together. And the tinnitus… it’s rather unpredictable, you see. It flares up and subsides at random. I must say, this is proving to be… remarkably unhelpful. Are you certain there isn’t a simpler way to determine my hearing? Perhaps a… visual test? Or some sort of… self-assessment questionnaire?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, you’re making this exceedingly difficult. This is the simplest way to get a baseline assessment of your hearing. If you continue to be unable to reliably indicate whether you hear the tones, the test is… meaningless. I can document that you refused to complete the audiometry screening, but I cannot provide a useful result. Do you want me to stop here?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Is that what we’ve come to? Refusing a test? Very well, Doctor. Document whatever you deem necessary. It seems this entire exercise is a… futile endeavor. Perhaps I should simply have remained at home. Stop, yes. Stop the test. I suppose I’ll have to find someone else to… rubber-stamp my certification. This has been… most unsatisfactory. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I've documented the incomplete screening and your reported inability to reliably participate due to tinnitus and subjective background noise interference. I'm afraid I can’t assist you further with this. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
