DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Kur. It’s good to meet you. I’ve been having some…well, numbness in my leg. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It's mostly in my left leg, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, numbness in the left leg. And how long is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three weeks, give or take a few days. It started gradually, just a little tingling, and has slowly gotten more… noticeable. Not painful, exactly, just… absent, I suppose. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Absent, okay. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. It seems to be worse when I've been standing for a long time, or if I'm really focused on something, like when I’m animating. It’ll fade when I sit down and rest for a bit, but then it comes back. It's not always there, though. Some days I barely notice it at all.
DOCTOR: Animating, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Kur. I’m a special effects artist and animator. Mostly digital work, so I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer. It’s a fairly demanding job, actually – requires a lot of concentration and precise movements. I often lose track of time when I’m working on a project, and I suspect that might be contributing to it. I've been doing it professionally for about two years now, before that it was mostly school work.
DOCTOR: I see. So, long periods of sitting, focused work... alright. And aside from this numbness, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no weakness, no changes in skin color… nothing else that I’ve noticed. My balance feels normal, I haven't tripped or anything. Just… the numbness. It's a bit unsettling, I suppose. I don't like the feeling of not having full sensation in my leg, but it's not debilitating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s go over some general health questions then, to get a fuller picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Dr. Kur. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My family doesn't have any history of severe allergies either, as far as I know. I’ve had all the standard childhood vaccinations, and I keep up-to-date with my annual flu shot. I also got the COVID boosters when they were available.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. I sometimes take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s about it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a balanced diet, so I figure I should be getting everything I need from my food. I'm generally quite healthy, I haven't had to see a doctor for anything significant in… well, years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing around, but it healed cleanly. And I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, things like that – but nothing serious. No surgeries, no chronic conditions… I can't really think of anything else. My parents are both fairly healthy as well, though my mother does have slightly high blood pressure, she's managing it with diet and exercise.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's have a look at your leg. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Dr. Kur. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Just relax. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups of both legs. Light touch is intact in both feet. There's a slight decrease in sensation to light touch on the lateral aspect of the left lower leg.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. I hadn't really noticed a difference in sensation myself, but I’m glad you’re checking thoroughly. Is that decrease significant, Dr. Kur? I apologize if I’m being difficult, I just want to understand what's going on. I'm not experiencing any pain during these tests, if that helps.
DOCTOR: It's subtle, Mr. Kinjerski. And not necessarily alarming, but it warrants further investigation. It could be a minor nerve compression – something that's easily aggravated by prolonged sitting or repetitive movements, like you describe with your work. But we need to rule out other possibilities. No tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine or lower extremities. Gait is normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. A nerve compression, from sitting too much. I suppose that makes sense, given my job. What kind of further investigation are you thinking of, Dr. Kur? Would imaging be necessary? Or perhaps some kind of… nerve test? I'm not particularly fond of needles, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Well, we could start with an MRI of the lumbar spine to rule out any structural abnormalities. But let’s not jump to that immediately. Often, these things resolve with conservative management. First, I recommend physical therapy – they can teach you exercises to strengthen your core and improve your posture, which can alleviate pressure on the nerves. We can also try some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. As for the “nerve test” – you’re referring to an electromyography, or EMG, and nerve conduction study. It can be helpful, but it is uncomfortable. We can certainly consider it if things don’t improve with physical therapy and conservative measures. But let's not do it right away. I suspect this is likely a mechanical issue, related to your work. But we need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds like a good plan, Dr. Kur. Physical therapy first, and see if that helps. I’m definitely willing to try that. I’d rather avoid the needle test if possible, so let’s hold off on that for now. Is there anything specific I should be doing in the meantime? Any stretches or exercises I can try on my own? And can you provide a referral to a physical therapy clinic nearby?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to refer you to Coastal Rehabilitation. They have excellent therapists. As for stretches, avoid anything that increases your numbness. But gentle stretching of your hamstrings and lower back can be helpful. Focus on maintaining good posture while you’re working. Set an alarm to remind you to get up and walk around every 30-60 minutes. And make sure your chair is ergonomically supportive. Here's the referral. You can schedule an appointment with them at your convenience. I want you to follow up with me in four weeks, and let me know how you're doing. If the numbness worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms—weakness, pain, bowel or bladder changes—contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay, four weeks. Coastal Rehabilitation. Got it. That all sounds very manageable. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment, Dr. Kur. Thank you for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you not immediately suggesting the needle test! I will schedule an appointment with Coastal Rehabilitation as soon as possible, and I'll be sure to contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kinjerski. Take care of yourself, and remember – good posture.
PATIENT: .
