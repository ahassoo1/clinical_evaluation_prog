DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knock. I’m Dr. Polczynski, but you can call me Derell. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Polczynski. It is a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as you likely know from my file, I’m here about the smoking. I’ve been… a smoker for a very long time, and I’ve finally decided it’s time to try and stop. A difficult thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see that in your file… a “long history of tobacco use,” it says. And you’re absolutely right, it is a difficult thing. It's great that you've made the decision though, that's the biggest step. To get a better idea of how to help you, could you tell me a little more about your smoking?
PATIENT: Certainly. How much detail would you like, Doctor? I suppose I started when I was quite young, around sixteen years of age. Lithuanian cigarettes were… easier to come by then, naturally. Now, I generally smoke… let me see… about a pack and a half a day. Maybe a little more if I’m stressed, or… bored. It’s become quite a habit, as you can imagine. I’ve tried to cut back before, a few times, but… it never lasted.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pack and a half a day… that's about how many cigarettes is that, roughly?
PATIENT: Ah, good question. I haven’t actually counted in… well, decades, I should think. Let me consider… a pack has twenty, yes? So, a pack and a half… that would be thirty cigarettes a day. Perhaps a few more on occasion, but thirty is a good average, I believe. It's… a considerable number, isn't it? I apologize. I didn’t intend to burden you with such a large figure.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Knock. It's important to have an accurate picture, and thirty a day is good to know. And it’s very common. Many people struggle with this, and we're here to help you, not to judge. Now, have you noticed any specific symptoms related to your smoking?
PATIENT: Symptoms… yes. Well, I get rather breathless when I exert myself, even simple things like climbing stairs. A bit of a cough, mostly in the mornings, though it has become… more frequent lately. And, I must confess, my energy levels are not what they once were. I tire easily. I don’t know if those are directly from the smoking, or simply… age, of course. I am seventy-four, after all. But I suspect the cigarettes are not helping.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathlessness with exertion, a cough that's increasing, and fatigue. Those are all things that can be related to smoking, and it’s good you’re noticing them. We’ll want to investigate those a bit further. Have you ever had any chest pains, wheezing, or coughing up any blood?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No chest pains at all. And no wheezing that I’ve noticed. No blood when I cough, either. Just… a persistent, dry cough. It’s more irritating than anything, really. It mostly happens in the mornings, after I’ve been lying down. It's… unpleasant, to be sure, but I haven’t been particularly alarmed by it, until recently. I suppose I’ve just grown accustomed to it, over the years.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And you're right, it’s easy to get used to things over time. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly. Nothing too severe, but it limits my mobility somewhat. And my doctor, back in… well, back in Lithuania, diagnosed me with mild hypertension several years ago. I take a small tablet for that, once a day. Aside from that, I’m generally… healthy, for my age. I try to eat a balanced diet, and I walk when I can, despite the arthritis. Though, naturally, the smoking doesn’t help with my stamina.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees and hypertension, controlled with medication. Good to know. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… Lisinopril, I believe. A small, white tablet. Ten milligrams, every morning with breakfast. I’ve been taking it for… oh, at least five years now, perhaps longer. It seems to keep the blood pressure under control, thankfully. My previous doctor monitored it regularly. I haven't had a full check-up since I moved here, unfortunately. It’s been… difficult to find a doctor I trust, and the language barrier… well, it’s not always easy to explain things.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Lisinopril, ten milligrams, and that's for your hypertension. It’s good it’s keeping things stable. We can certainly get you a full check-up here, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, not any major surgeries, no. I had my tonsils removed when I was a young man, perhaps ten or eleven years of age. And… I had a rather nasty wisdom tooth extracted when I was in my twenties, but that hardly counts as surgery, does it? Aside from those two minor procedures, I’ve been… remarkably fortunate, health-wise. Or, at least, I was fortunate, before the cigarettes took their toll.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child and a wisdom tooth extraction. No other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family, is there a history of any serious illnesses, such as heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: That is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… well, we didn’t have much in the way of medical care, growing up. And we didn't discuss such things openly. My father… he smoked heavily his entire life, and he died of a heart attack when he was quite young, in his early sixties. My mother… she passed away from pneumonia when I was still a boy. And I had an older brother, but he emigrated to America many years ago, and I haven’t heard from him since. I… I don’t know anything about his health. It’s not something we discussed, even before he left. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’ve told me quite enough, Mr. Knock. It sounds like your father had a heart attack and you haven't had contact with your brother. It's not always easy to have that information, and you're not to blame for that. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I don’t have any food allergies, either. I eat most things, though I try to avoid… overly processed foods, if possible. I suppose I’m not particularly adventurous when it comes to cuisine. I prefer simple, traditional dishes, mostly Lithuanian fare. But, no allergies to report, Doctor. I’ve always been quite robust, in that regard. Or, at least, I was.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. And finally, just to clarify, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: No, nothing else at all. Just the Lisinopril, as I mentioned. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I always believed a balanced diet was the best medicine, and I've tried to adhere to that principle as much as possible. I suppose I'm rather old-fashioned in that regard. But no, Doctor. Just the Lisinopril. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Knock. That gives me a good overview of your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam is a good idea. I'm happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. I understand it is important to have a thorough assessment. Please, proceed at your convenience. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here on the table, please. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. It will be a little cold. Then I’ll take your blood pressure again.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A little coldness is no matter. I am accustomed to the Lithuanian winters, you see. Proceed as you wish. I will remain still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. I'm hearing a slight murmur, which we’ll want to monitor. Nothing immediate to worry about, but it's something we should keep an eye on. And your lungs… I’m noticing some diminished breath sounds, especially in the lower lobes. There’s also a little bit of wheezing on exertion. This is consistent with some airway obstruction, likely from years of smoking. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. It could be due to stress, or simply the fact that you're here at the doctor’s office. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. Your pulses are a little weak in your ankles, which could be a sign of peripheral artery disease, but it’s not definitive. Your ears and throat look clear. No signs of infection or inflammation. Okay. Everything seems fairly stable, but there are a few things I’d like to investigate further. We need to get some blood work done to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. And I’d also like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs.
PATIENT: That all sounds very sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Blood work and an X-ray… perfectly understandable. I trust your judgment. I am… resigned to the fact that years of smoking have taken their toll. I just hope it is not too late to mitigate some of the damage. What is the next step, regarding these tests? And, if you don't mind me asking, what sort of timeline are we looking at?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not too late, Mr. Knock. And, honestly, simply stopping smoking will make a huge difference. We'll use these tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health and guide our treatment plan. I'll write you a referral for the blood work now. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance – though you mentioned you are not insured, so we can discuss options for affordable testing. It typically takes a day or two to get the results back. As for the chest X-ray, I'll send a request to the radiology department. They usually schedule appointments within a week. In the meantime, let’s talk about options for quitting smoking. There are several methods available, including nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges – and medications like bupropion or varenicline. We can also explore behavioral therapy and support groups. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the methods for cessation. I have… heard of patches, of course, and I suppose they may assist. But, truthfully, Doctor, I have attempted them before, with limited success. The… the habit is quite ingrained, you see. I fear the psychological aspect is more challenging than the physical withdrawal. Regarding the medications… I confess I am somewhat apprehensive about introducing more chemicals into my system, especially at my age. I prefer a more… natural approach, if possible. Perhaps behavioral therapy, as you mentioned? Although, I am not certain if I am the ideal candidate for such a thing. A stubborn old man, set in his ways… it's not a promising combination, is it? I am… open to suggestions, of course, but I am rather skeptical. Perhaps a frank discussion of the challenges I anticipate would be… beneficial?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Knock. Many people find the psychological aspect the most difficult part, and it's good you're aware of that. It’s also wise to be cautious about medications, especially given your age and preferences. Let's definitely talk about the challenges you anticipate. What specifically do you find most difficult about quitting?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it is… multifaceted, I suppose. Firstly, there is the… routine. The cigarette with my morning coffee, the one after a meal, the one during a moment of contemplation… it is woven into the fabric of my day. To simply remove it… it feels… disruptive. Secondly, there is the… comfort. It is a rather shameful admission, I know, but the cigarette provides a certain… solace. During moments of stress, or boredom, or loneliness… it is a familiar companion. And, perhaps most importantly, there is the… fear. The fear of failure, the fear of withdrawal symptoms, the fear of losing a… a lifelong habit. It sounds foolish, I know, but it is a deeply ingrained part of my identity, for better or worse. I fear that without it, I will be… diminished. A rather bleak outlook, I suppose, but it is my honest assessment. And, if I am being truthful, the cravings themselves are… formidable. A constant, nagging presence in the back of my mind. I am… overwhelmed simply contemplating the task ahead.
DOCTOR: That is not foolish at all, Mr. Knock. You’ve articulated those challenges beautifully, and they are incredibly common. It’s a testament to how deeply ingrained the habit is, and it's perfectly understandable that you feel overwhelmed. What you’ve described isn’t a weakness, it’s an addiction, and it requires a thoughtful, multifaceted approach. Simply telling you to “just stop” wouldn’t be helpful, and I wouldn’t do that. Let's break it down. We’ve already identified the routine, the comfort, and the fear. Now, let's think about practical strategies to address each of those. Regarding the routine, have you considered finding alternative habits to replace the cigarettes?
PATIENT: That is… a sensible suggestion, Doctor. Alternative habits. I confess, I haven’t given it much thought, truthfully. My focus has been primarily on avoiding the cigarettes, rather than replacing them. It is… a different perspective. Hmm… let me consider. Perhaps a morning walk, instead of a cigarette with my coffee? Although, I am not certain I possess the willpower to resist the temptation. Or perhaps a… a hobby? I used to enjoy woodworking, many years ago, but I haven't touched a chisel in decades. It feels… daunting to re-engage with such things. And, frankly, I am not certain I possess the energy or enthusiasm. But… it is a thought. A rather faint one, admittedly. And I fear it would require a considerable effort to establish a new routine. Perhaps it is… unrealistic? I am… skeptical, but I am willing to consider alternatives. If you have any suggestions, Doctor, I would be grateful.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t have to be a major undertaking, Mr. Knock. Small changes can make a big difference. And it's perfectly fine to start small. A five-minute walk, or spending a few minutes each day revisiting an old hobby… those are perfectly reasonable starting points. And it's also important to be kind to yourself. There will be setbacks, and that's okay. Don't view them as failures, but as learning opportunities. Regarding hobbies, do you think you'd be more inclined towards something physical, like walking or gardening, or something more mentally stimulating, like reading or puzzles?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question, Doctor. I believe… something mentally stimulating would be preferable. My arthritis prevents me from engaging in much physical activity, and I confess, gardening holds little appeal. I have always enjoyed reading, though my eyesight isn't what it once was. Perhaps… puzzles? Crosswords, or Sudoku, or something of that nature? They require a degree of concentration, which may distract me from the cravings. And they are… relatively inexpensive and accessible. It wouldn’t require a significant investment of time or effort. A small, manageable activity. Yes, I believe puzzles would be a reasonable starting point. Perhaps I could even… join a local club? Although, the thought of socializing fills me with a degree of trepidation. But… it is a possibility. A faint one, admittedly. But… a possibility nonetheless. Do you believe such a thing would be… beneficial, Doctor? Would it assist with the… psychological aspect of cessation?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Knock. Joining a local club, even if you only attend occasionally, could be incredibly beneficial. It provides social support, a sense of community, and a distraction from your cravings. And it gives you something to look forward to. It's also a way to meet people who share your interests, which can be a great source of encouragement. And even if you don't feel comfortable joining a club right away, there are online puzzle communities where you can interact with others from the comfort of your own home. So, let's focus on two things for now: finding alternative habits, starting with puzzles, and exploring resources for quitting smoking. I can provide you with some information on nicotine replacement therapy and medications, even if you're hesitant to try them right away. And I can also give you some websites and support groups that may be helpful. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… eminently reasonable. A measured approach, focusing on small, achievable goals. Puzzles and exploration of resources… it is a sensible strategy. I appreciate your patience and understanding. The information on resources… that would be most helpful. And, if you have any recommendations for local puzzle clubs, I would be grateful. I confess, I am rather… unfamiliar with such things. But… I am willing to explore the possibilities. Perhaps… a small step in the right direction. I am… cautiously optimistic, Doctor. And I thank you for your assistance. I believe… we may be onto something.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here is some information on local support groups and resources for quitting smoking, as well as a list of puzzle clubs in the area. I've also included a website with information on nicotine replacement therapy and medications. Remember, Mr. Knock, this is a journey, not a race. There will be setbacks, and that's okay. The important thing is to keep moving forward, one small step at a time. And I'm here to support you every step of the way. We’ll get those blood work orders sent, and get you scheduled for that chest X-ray. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you’re doing. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… most agreeable. A follow-up appointment in a month. It provides a… framework. A sense of accountability. I appreciate your thoroughness and support. I will… review these materials at my leisure. And I will… explore the possibilities. Puzzles, support groups… it is… daunting, but… not insurmountable. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You have… instilled a degree of hope. A small one, admittedly, but… a welcome one nonetheless. I believe… I may actually be able to accomplish this. I thank you again for your assistance. It is… greatly appreciated. I shall see you in a month. .
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Mr. Knock. And please, call me Derell. You've already taken the biggest step, which is deciding to quit. And I have every confidence that you can accomplish this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in a month.
