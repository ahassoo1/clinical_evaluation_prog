DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh... well, it's this shaking. My hands, mostly. Been happening for... a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long. It's just... annoying, really. I'm Lyman, by the way. Lyman Jezik.
DOCTOR: Lyman, good to meet you. Yes, the shaking… alright. It’s helpful you brought that up. “A while now” is… vague, and that's perfectly alright. It happens. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Vague is... a good word for it. I work, you see. Always have. Water treatment. It... keeps me busy. But the shaking… it started when I was doing things at work, I think. Fine movements, tightening valves... things like that. Now it happens... just sitting, sometimes. It’s worse when I try to hold something steady. Like a cup of coffee. Makes a mess.
DOCTOR: Water treatment, that’s important work. And fine motor skills are definitely needed for that. So, it seems to be impacting your daily life, with the coffee and things. Has it been getting progressively worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Progressively... Hmm. I don't know. Hard to say. It feels... different sometimes. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days… well, I dropped a wrench the other day. Nearly took a toe off. Not my toe, thankfully. But still… it’s worrying. I try not to think about it too much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Dropping tools is concerning, yes. It’s good you're acknowledging it, Lyman. Trying not to worry is understandable, but it's also good to get it checked out. Now, besides your hands, have you noticed any shaking in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Other parts...? I... I don't think so. Maybe a little in my legs, sometimes, but I chalked that up to getting old, you know? I walk a lot at work. Lots of stairs. Everything gets a little shaky after a long day. Hard to say if it's that shaking, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And you walk a lot, that makes sense. Now, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Other than the shaking? Let me think... Honestly, no, not really. I get tired, of course. I'm 79, Doctor! But that's just... old age. Nothing else I can think of. Maybe a little… forgetful sometimes. But who isn’t at my age? I'm not sure that's a symptom, though.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness is common, you’re right. We'll keep that in mind. Now, Lyman, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions...? Not really. I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy. And... a bad knee, years ago, from a football injury. But nothing serious. I don't take any medications regularly. Not anymore, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed, knee injury… good to know. No current medications. And are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Not that I'm aware of. I eat everything. Well, not everything. I don't care for beets. But that's not an allergy, is it? No reactions to any medications I've taken in the past, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: No allergies, that’s good. Beets are perfectly fine to dislike! Now, Lyman, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you know of any family members who've had similar shaking or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological…? Oh dear. That’s a complicated question, Doctor. My mother… she got a little shaky when she was very old, I think. But that was just old age, again. My father… he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. I don't really know much about anyone else. My family… we weren’t close. Mostly, I’m on my own.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Lyman. It’s common not to know much about family history. So, mother had some shaking in old age… that’s something to consider. Now, and please don’t feel pressured to answer if this is too personal, but could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle...? I work. A lot. That’s... my lifestyle. I live alone, in a small house near the plant. I used to… I was married, once. Divorced now, a long time ago. I don't drink much. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. That's about it. Pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Simple and steady. Alright, Lyman. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just a few simple tests to assess your reflexes, balance, and the nature of the shaking. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but... I want to get this sorted out. Yes, go ahead. Just... be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll take a look at your hands and arms. Please relax your arm for me… Good. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6, perfectly normal. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There you go. It's probably worse now, knowing you're looking at them. It always seems to be that way.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a tremor present in both hands, more prominent on this side . It appears to be a resting tremor, meaning it’s most noticeable when your hands are relaxed. There's some rigidity as well, a slight resistance to movement. Now, please close your eyes and tap your finger to your nose repeatedly, alternating hands.
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I see some slight difficulty with coordination and accuracy. And now, I'd like you to walk a few steps for me, nice and slowly.
PATIENT: Just a few steps… I feel like I’m walking on a tightrope.
DOCTOR: Yes, I notice some slight shuffling and a decreased arm swing. Your balance appears stable, but slightly impaired. Alright, Lyman. That’s enough for now. Please sit down on the exam table. Based on what I’ve seen and heard, and with your age and medical history in mind, this could be indicative of essential tremor, although we will need to rule out other possibilities. It's important to get some blood work done to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other underlying conditions. I'm also going to order a neurological consult.
PATIENT: Neurological...? Well. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? What is essential tremor? And a blood test... and a specialist... I was hoping it was just old age, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lyman. It's natural to be worried. Essential tremor isn’t necessarily "bad" in the sense of being life-threatening, but it can be disruptive to daily life, as you’ve experienced. It’s a neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, most commonly in the hands, and it tends to worsen over time. It’s not caused by anything specific and often runs in families, although that doesn’t mean you definitely would have gotten it just because of family history. The blood tests will help us rule out other causes of tremor, such as thyroid problems or medication side effects. The neurological consult will allow a specialist to perform a more in-depth examination and confirm the diagnosis and discuss potential treatment options. Treatment can include medication, lifestyle adjustments, or, in some cases, surgery. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll be with you every step of the way. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… it’s not my imagination, then? It is something real? And it can be treated? Medication… I don’t really want to take a lot of pills, if I can help it. Lifestyle adjustments… what does that even mean? Less coffee? I already barely drink any. It’s just… a lot to take in. I was hoping for a simple answer.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. You’re right, it's not your imagination – it's a real condition, and getting a diagnosis is the first step toward managing it. Lifestyle adjustments can mean different things for different people. For some, it might involve reducing caffeine or alcohol intake, although as you said, you already barely drink any coffee. For others, it might involve stress management techniques like relaxation exercises or regular light exercise. Occupational therapy can also be helpful in learning techniques to make everyday tasks easier. We'll discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results of the blood tests and the neurological consult. The specialist will be the best person to guide you on the most appropriate treatment plan, and we'll work together to find what works best for you. I'll write down the lab order and the referral to the neurologist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Just... the specialist. What's their name? And where are they located? I don’t drive much anymore. Is it far? And… how long will it take to get an appointment? I don’t want to wait months just to find out what’s wrong. And… will my insurance cover any of this? Oh… wait. I don't have insurance, do I?
DOCTOR: Dr. Evelyn Hayes. She’s a neurologist at St. Jude's Hospital, about 30 minutes from here, depending on traffic. We can arrange transportation for you if you'd like – the clinic has a volunteer driver program. Appointment times can vary, but I’ll put in a referral with a note of urgency, explaining your situation. I can also call her office directly to see if they can expedite the process. As for insurance… you mentioned you are uninsured. That’s alright. St. Jude’s Hospital has a financial assistance program for patients who are unable to afford medical care. I’ll provide you with information about how to apply. The program will assess your income and help to reduce or waive your medical bills. I will print out the lab order, the referral information, and the financial assistance application for you. Do you want me to explain anything else at this moment?
PATIENT: That… that’s a lot, Doctor. Thank you. Really. For explaining everything and… for the help with the insurance. I appreciate it more than you know. I think… I think I need to sit down for a minute. I’m a little overwhelmed. Just the paperwork, I guess. And… the thought of all this. Can you just… hand me the papers? I’ll take it from there. I'm sure I can figure it out.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take your time, Lyman. No rush at all. Here are the lab order, Dr. Hayes’ referral information, and the financial assistance application. I've highlighted the important sections on each form. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or need help filling them out. My nurse, Sarah, is very helpful. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just sit back, take a deep breath, and we’ll take it one step at a time. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Really, thank you. You’ve been very kind. And patient. I suppose I should get this started then. The sooner I get it done, the sooner I'll know what's going on. Thank you again, Doctor Smetak. I… I appreciate everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lyman. I'm glad I could help. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. We’re here to support you. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
