DOCTOR: Alright, Kahrin. So, you're 29 years old... and you're here today because…?
PATIENT: Just for the results, please. I don't really have time to go over everything again. I remember what I came in for, and what was done.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d prefer to skip the usual process, but as a physician, I need to have a complete understanding of your concerns and the workup performed to ensure the best possible care. It's not efficient to rely solely on memory, for either of us. However... I can pull up the results from your visit on August 2nd. It appears we ran a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Give me one moment. Okay, so your CBC was within normal limits. Metabolic panel...slightly elevated creatinine, but not drastically. Urinalysis showed a trace of protein... again, nothing alarming on its own. Now, do you remember why we ordered these tests?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not specifically. I just felt… off. Tired, mostly. And a little achy. The nurse asked a bunch of questions and then ordered blood and pee tests. I figured it was better to check, you know? Is the creatinine the reason you called me in?
DOCTOR: Right. “Feeling off.” That's… not a diagnosis, Kahrin. And yes, the slightly elevated creatinine is why I wanted to discuss this with you. It’s not high enough to be immediately concerning, but it's a change from your baseline, and we need to investigate. To be clear, creatinine is a waste product filtered by your kidneys. Elevated levels can indicate kidney issues, but it can also be influenced by dehydration, muscle mass, and certain medications. Now, have you been drinking enough fluids lately?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. I drink water throughout the day. Maybe a bit more coffee than I should, though. And I do a lot of hiking, so my muscles get worked. I don’t take any medications regularly, just ibuprofen if I’m really sore from a hike. Is ibuprofen a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the hiking and the ibuprofen. That’s…relevant. Frequent use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen can affect kidney function, particularly with dehydration. It's not ideal, especially with increased physical activity. So, let's try to quantify this a little. How often would you say you’re taking ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Um… it depends. If I’ve got a really tough hike, maybe two or three days in a row. Like, 400mg each time, twice a day if needed. Otherwise, not very often. Maybe once a month for a headache or something. It’s usually just when I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Two or three days consecutively, 400mg twice a day… that could be contributing to the slightly elevated creatinine. We’ll need to rule out other potential causes, but I want to start with some lifestyle adjustments and repeat the blood work. First, drastically reduce the ibuprofen use. Try acetaminophen for pain relief, and consider other methods like ice packs and rest. More importantly, increase your fluid intake significantly – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day, especially after your hikes. I’m going to order another metabolic panel to be done in two weeks. If the creatinine hasn't improved, we may need to investigate further, possibly with a referral to a nephrologist. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. No ibuprofen for a while, drink more water. I can do that. Two weeks is fine. I just... I don't want this to be something serious, you know? I've got a lot going on. So, just the blood test then? Nothing else right now?
DOCTOR: For now, yes. Just the repeat metabolic panel. We'll assess the results, and if necessary, we'll proceed with further investigation. It’s unlikely to be anything serious given your age and activity level, but we need to be thorough. I'll have the lab requisition printed for you now. Make sure to stay well hydrated before your appointment. And please, limit the ibuprofen. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just the blood test, limit ibuprofen, drink water. Got it. Thank you. I appreciate you not making me repeat everything. It feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. .
