DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're a new patient with San SCIARROTTA clinic. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning Doctor. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-share. Or maybe a taxi… something like that. It’s for commercial driving. I just want to be sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the law.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver’s license medical certification, then. That's what you're after. It’s a fairly standard examination, though it does have specific requirements. I see… are you currently driving commercially, or are you planning to begin?
PATIENT: Not currently. I’m just getting ready. I… well, my grandson needs some help with expenses, and I thought I could do a bit of ride-sharing to earn some money. I haven’t done it before, so I need the card first, obviously. And I want to make sure I’m healthy enough. That’s the important part, really. Don’t want to risk anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sensible. We'll certainly assess your overall health. Now, to be thorough, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—things like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… high blood pressure, yes. Years ago. They put me on medication for a while, but I stopped taking it, I think… maybe ten years ago? The doctor said it was okay, that it came down on its own. And…arthritis. In my hands, mostly. It gets bad sometimes, makes it hard to grip things, but it's manageable. Nothing else, I don’t think. I had a gallbladder removed a long time ago, but that wasn’t a condition, just… surgery. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure in the past, now off medication, and arthritis in your hands. And gallbladder removal, noted. It’s good you mention these things. We’ll need to check your current blood pressure, of course. And the arthritis… does it affect your ability to safely operate a vehicle, in your opinion?
PATIENT: Well… it can be painful. Especially in the cold. Makes it harder to steer sometimes, if I’m being honest. I have to grip the wheel tighter, and that makes it worse. But I can manage. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers when it’s bad, and I try to wear gloves, even in the summer. It’s not constant, you see. Just… flares up sometimes. I haven’t had any accidents because of it, if that’s what you’re worried about.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mrs. Sciarrotta. No accidents is good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, besides the pain relievers for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the pain relievers when I need them. And… sometimes a little something for sleep. It’s not every night, just when I’m really restless. It’s…melatonin, I think? The little gummy ones. And sometimes vitamins. A multivitamin, and… calcium, for my bones. That’s it. I really try not to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. Melatonin as needed for sleep, a multivitamin, and calcium supplements. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my entire life, and never had a reaction. My mother always said I had an iron stomach. And I’ve never had a problem with any medications either. I’ve had a few vaccinations over the years, of course, but nothing serious. Do you need to know what vaccines I've had? I don't really keep track.
DOCTOR: No, we don't need a full list. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Finally, a quick question about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, stroke, diabetes, things like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tough one. My mother lived to be ninety-five, and she was healthy as a horse right up until the end. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t really remember much about it. And my brother… he had something with his blood sugar, I think. But I’m not sure what. It was a long time ago. We didn't really talk about these things much in my family. Is this important? I'm terrible with remembering family history.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know what you do remember, Mrs. Sciarrotta. We'll proceed with a physical examination now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and assess your range of motion. Then, we may need to take some bloodwork to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Anything to make sure I’m safe. Just tell me what I need to do. And please, don’t rush me. I might be a little slow. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to rush at all. Please, have a seat on the examination table. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you are, Doctor. Be gentle, please. This old arm doesn't bend like it used to.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible. Now, relax your arm. … 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright. One, two, three… Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I'm doing it right. I always feel a bit silly breathing like this.
DOCTOR: …Heart sounds are regular, though a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Could you please rest your feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. Do you need me to do anything special? Like cross my legs or something? I always get nervous during these things. I'm afraid you'll find something terrible.
DOCTOR: …Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, could you please try to grip my hands as firmly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. I’m trying, Doctor. It's a little sore, but I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that strong enough? I hope my arthritis isn’t too bad. It's been acting up lately, with the change in the weather.
DOCTOR: …Grip strength is diminished bilaterally, consistent with your report of arthritis. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your hands and wrists. Please rotate your wrists clockwise and then counterclockwise.
PATIENT: Alright. This is a little difficult, Doctor. It’s stiff. It feels…grindy, if that makes sense. Like there’s sand in the joints. And it’s a bit painful, especially when I go all the way around. Is that okay? I’m trying not to push myself too hard. I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your range of motion is limited bilaterally, and there’s some discomfort with movement, as you described. Now, I’m going to check your vision and hearing.
PATIENT: Okay. I haven't had my vision checked in a while. It's not too bad, I don't think. I can still read the newspaper, and I can see the television. But things are getting a little blurry sometimes, especially at night. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Just be gentle. This old head doesn't move like it used to either.
DOCTOR: …Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Visual acuity is slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. Now, let me take a look at your ears. …Ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes are intact. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. That completes the physical examination. Overall, you appear to be in relatively good health for your age, but we do need to address your elevated blood pressure and your arthritis. I'd like to order some bloodwork to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Bloodwork is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And… what about the driving? Can I get the card? I really need to know if I can do this, to help my grandson. It’s a bit of a worry, to be honest. Is there any reason why I shouldn’t be driving?
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sciarrotta, based on this initial examination, there are no immediate reasons to disqualify you from driving. However, your diminished grip strength and slightly reduced vision warrant further consideration. The bloodwork will give us a clearer picture of your overall health, and we may consider a consultation with an occupational therapist to assess your functional capacity and provide recommendations for adaptive equipment, if necessary. We also need to get your blood pressure under control. Once we have the bloodwork results, we can discuss these options in more detail. It's important to be thorough, to ensure both your safety and the safety of others. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That… makes sense. An occupational therapist… I’ve never heard of that before, but it sounds… helpful. And the blood pressure, yes, I should probably get that checked more often. So, no definite ‘no’ on the card yet? Just… more tests? Is that right? And how long will the bloodwork take? I’m a bit anxious, you see. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s a bit of a… a weight on my mind, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Mrs. Sciarrotta. No definite "no" at this time. The bloodwork is a necessary step to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. It typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the results to come back from the lab. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave today, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re just taking precautions, to ensure your safety and the safety of others. We will get this sorted out together. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just the bloodwork, and then the follow-up appointment. And maybe… try to relax. It's easier said than done, but I’ll try. Thank you for not just saying ‘no’ right away. It’s a relief. Now… where do we go for the bloodwork?
DOCTOR: The nurse, Sarah, will take you directly to the lab. It's just down the hall, second door on the right. She’ll explain the procedure and answer any questions you may have. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment, which we’ll schedule before you leave today. Do you have any mobility issues that I should inform Sarah about?
PATIENT: No, not really. I walk alright, though I'm a bit slow sometimes, and I get tired easily. Nothing she needs to worry about, I don't think. Just… old age. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your patience. I always worry about these things, to be honest. It’s just… a lot to take in sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Please, don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns before you leave. Sarah will be right with you. And remember, we're just taking things one step at a time. Let's let the bloodwork guide our next steps. Do you need any assistance getting up?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can manage. I think I'm good. Just a bit wobbly. Alright. Well, I suppose I’ll go find Sarah. Thank you again, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
