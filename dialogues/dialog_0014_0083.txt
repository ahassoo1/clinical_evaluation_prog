DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, good day to you too, Doctor. I am here… well, my daughter, she says I need a little… a little something from you. A card, she said. A “get well” card. I am not sick, you understand. Just… low spirits. A little down. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Right. "Low spirits." And how long have you been feeling… low, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Oh, a while now. A good… oh, maybe three, four months? It’s the summer, you see. Everything feels… empty. Not like the old days. Not like when I was working, fixing things. Now, it’s just… quiet. Too much quiet. My ex-wife, she always said I needed to be doing something. Maybe she was right, for once.
DOCTOR: Three or four months. Okay. And has anything specific happened during that time that might be contributing to this feeling?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm. Not that I can rightly recall. The grand-kids don't visit as much. They got… things to do, I suppose. And my neighbor, old Man Hemmings, he passed. Good man, Hemmings. We used to sit on the porch and watch the cars go by. But other than that... no. Nothing specific. Just… life, I guess. It loses its flavor sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say “low spirits,” can you describe what that feels like, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a pain, Doctor. Not a hurt you can point to. It’s… like a weight, maybe? In your chest. And you don't want to do things. Even things you used to enjoy. Like… fixing things around the house. I got a leaky faucet, been meaning to get to it for weeks. But… what’s the point, really? It just gets leaky again, doesn't it? It's a… a tiredness. A tiredness of the soul, I think is what my mother would call it.
DOCTOR: A tiredness of the soul... Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep, your appetite, or your energy levels, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. I sleep enough. Too much, maybe. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. Appetite is… normal, I suppose. I eat. Not with much gusto, but I eat. Energy… well, you already know about the energy. It's gone. Like a lightbulb that’s burned out. I used to be able to work all day, now I get winded just walking to the mailbox. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medicare takes care of most things. I got somethin’ for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… that’s it, I think. Oh! And the doctor gave me somethin’ for my knees a while back. Arthritis, he said. But I don't take it much. Doesn't do much good anyway. Just makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, arthritis medication… not taking the arthritis medication regularly. Any allergies I should know about, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with… plants or animals or anything. Maybe a little sniffle with the dust sometimes, but who doesn’t? My ex-wife, she was allergic to cats. That was a problem, let me tell you. Always sneezing. But I don’t have allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, Mr. Kammer. Just a basic check-up to get a better picture of things. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, yes, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Though I don’t see what poking and prodding is going to do for a tired soul, but… go ahead. Just don't take too long, if you don't mind. My supper will get cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight for me... First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is a little elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little high, but not drastically so. Reflexes are normal. Strength appears adequate in all extremities. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Following the finger… like this? Yes. I used to have very steady hands. Machinist work, you see. Had to be precise. Very precise. These old hands have seen a lot of things, though. A lot of grease and metal. Following the finger... Yes, right there. Is that alright, Doctor? Do you need me to… do anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s enough for now. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, there doesn't seem to be any obvious physical cause for your symptoms. Your vital signs are a bit elevated, but not alarming. It sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of… well, what we often call depression. It's not a sign of weakness, Mr. Kammer, and it’s very treatable. It's a common reaction to loss, change, and feeling… disconnected.
PATIENT: Depression? Me? I’m not… depressed. I’m just… tired. And things aren’t what they used to be. That's all. Always looking for a fancy name for things, aren't they? My mother used to say a little fresh air and hard work cures most ills. Not pills and labels.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Kammer. But sometimes, that "tiredness" is a symptom, and it requires more than just fresh air and hard work. It can be a chemical imbalance, a lack of certain nutrients, a disruption in your sleep patterns. I can prescribe a mild antidepressant if you’re willing to try it. It might help lift your spirits and give you a little more energy. I also recommend we schedule you for some blood work to rule out any deficiencies. And, if you’re open to it, I can give you the number for a local therapist. Talking to someone can be incredibly helpful.
PATIENT: Therapist? Now you're talking nonsense, Doctor. I don't need to talk to anyone. I've lived a long life, I know what's what. Pills, maybe… I don't know. I don't like the idea of being on pills. What if they make me sleepy? And… what if they change who I am? I just wanted a card, you see. A little encouragement. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer. We can start with the blood work, to rule out any underlying medical causes. And I can prescribe a very low dose of an antidepressant, just to see if it makes a difference. If you don’t like how it makes you feel, we can stop it immediately. But I strongly urge you to reconsider the therapy. It’s not about weakness, it's about taking care of your mental health, just like you would with a physical ailment. I'll write you a prescription for the blood work and the medication. And I'll print out a list of local therapists, just in case you change your mind. It’s up to you, of course.
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, pills… whatever. But I’m telling you, Doctor, I don't think it’s going to do much good. And no, I don't want a list of… talkers. Just the prescription, please. And a card would still be nice, if it’s not too much trouble. A little something to put on the fridge. Just to remind me… things will get better.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The prescription for the blood work and the medication. The blood work should be done at the lab across the street. They'll take care of everything. And here. It's not much, but… I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to discuss the blood work results and see how you’re feeling. If anything changes before then, or if you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's… alright. I suppose. I’ll see what the tests say. And I appreciate the card. Good day to you. .
