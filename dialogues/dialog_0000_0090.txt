DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi Brightful. 29 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Batara. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. A cosmetic one. I believe it’s a clearance appointment? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that sort of thing. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. My husband… he helped with all the arrangements, and it’s been some time since then.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic surgery, hmm. Well, that’s… certainly a choice. A clearance appointment, yes. It's important to be sure you’re a suitable candidate, regardless. "Fuzzy" isn't ideal, but we can sort it out. To start, what type of surgery are you hoping to have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… the part that’s most unclear, I’m afraid. I think it has to do with… my stomach? Something about removing excess skin? He said something about it being a good option after… after significant weight loss. I’ve lost some weight, certainly, but… I don't recall precisely why I wanted this particular surgery, just that he thought it would be a good idea. It feels silly to say, I know.
DOCTOR: "Silly" or not, it’s important to understand your motivations. Significant weight loss… alright. So, a panniculectomy or potentially abdominoplasty are possibilities. We need to establish how much weight you’ve lost, over what period, and what your current weight is. Your chart says 93 kilograms, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. 93 kilograms, yes. I… I think I lost it over the course of about a year? It was after… well, after everything. Eating wasn't much of a priority. It just… came off. I wasn’t really trying, if that makes sense. And honestly, I don’t remember the exact numbers. I'm sorry. It feels awful to be so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: "Not helpful." Well, it's not ideal, certainly. Losing weight unintentionally is… concerning in itself. We’ll need to address that later, regardless of the surgery. But for now, let’s focus on the potential procedure. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don't believe so. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. I generally feel… okay. A little tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to… everything. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful? And I take a daily multivitamin, if that counts for anything.
DOCTOR: "Generally okay." Insurance is helpful for coverage, yes. A multivitamin... minimally helpful. We need a proper medical history. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't had many medications in my life, to be honest. I used to get migraines occasionally, and took… ibuprofen? But I don't recall any reaction to it. Nothing serious, at least. I don't have any known allergies to food either. Is that helpful, Doctor? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: "Rambling" is putting it mildly. No documented allergies, alright. We need to do a physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s standard procedure. And please try to remember anything relevant – past surgeries, illnesses, anything at all. This isn’t a social visit, Ms. Brightful.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I understand, Doctor. I apologize for being… unhelpful. I will try my very best to remember. It’s just… difficult. Everything feels so distant. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. This might be slightly uncomfortable. Let me know if you experience any significant pain. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes. A little. There. It’s not… sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache. It’s been there for… a while, I think. I hadn't really paid much attention to it, honestly. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: “Not bad” is a relative term, Ms. Brightful. Dull ache in the lower right quadrant… That could be a number of things. We'll need to investigate further. Any history of constipation or changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Constipation… yes, actually. On and off, mostly. It comes and goes. And… my bowel habits have definitely changed. They’re… less regular than they used to be. More infrequent, I suppose. I hadn’t really thought much of it, to be honest. It seemed… normal, given everything. Is that important, Doctor? I’m sorry, I feel like I’m just listing off a bunch of vague complaints.
DOCTOR: "Vague complaints" are unhelpful, Ms. Brightful, but changes in bowel habits are relevant. Inconsistent bowel movements and lower right quadrant pain… We need to rule out any underlying pathology. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. And, given your symptoms, I recommend a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis.
PATIENT: A CT scan… Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it something to be worried about, Doctor? I’m sorry to be so… anxious. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming. And I really just wanted to get cleared for the surgery…
DOCTOR: “Anxious” is understandable, Ms. Brightful, but catastrophizing is not. A CT scan is a diagnostic tool, not a death sentence. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms. It could be something benign, but we cannot rule out anything without proper investigation. I’m ordering the tests now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. And I'm referring you to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. Here. This is the gastroenterologist’s information. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. We will discuss the results once they are available. For now, I'm putting the cosmetic surgery on hold until we have a clearer picture of your overall health. Your well-being is my priority, Ms. Brightful, not your aesthetic preferences.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I understand, Doctor. It’s just… it was supposed to be something… positive. Something to help me feel better about myself. I… I’ll schedule the appointments. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I’m done here?
DOCTOR: Yes. The lab and gastroenterologist will contact you. Follow their instructions carefully. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the results. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. .
