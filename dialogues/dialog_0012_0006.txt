DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor Yoshino. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, a few days ago, I coughed up some blood. It scared me a lot. Not… not a lot of blood, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It happened… two times. The first time was when I was… getting ready for work. And the second time was last night, before I went to sleep. It was… bright red. And mixed with… the stuff I usually cough up, you know? Sorry, it is difficult to explain. I don’t… I don’t know what it means.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, you're doing fine. It is difficult to talk about. Bright red blood, mixed with your usual mucus… that helps. And about how much was it each time?
PATIENT: Um… perhaps… a teaspoon? Maybe a little more, the first time. Last night… maybe half a teaspoon. It is not… a big amount, but I have never seen blood when I cough before. I am a little worried it is something… serious. My husband… he would always take me to the doctor when I was sick. It is… different now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's completely valid to be worried when you see blood. It’s good you're getting it checked out. And I’m sorry to hear about your husband—that must be difficult. Okay, so a teaspoon or a little more each time. Was there anything specific that triggered the coughing?
PATIENT: Nothing… not really. The first time, I was just… getting dressed. I felt a little tickle in my throat, so I coughed. And then… the blood. Last night, I was lying in bed, reading. Just a normal cough. I haven't been sick, though. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. I do… sometimes have a little trouble breathing when I exercise, but that is nothing new. I thought it was just because I am… not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or other signs of illness. You’ve had some trouble breathing with exercise for a while now. And the blood just appeared with a normal cough. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. My husband… he tried it when he was young, but he stopped very quickly. He said it made him feel terrible. I have always been very careful about… things like that. I try to eat healthy, and I walk every day, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And walking is excellent! Okay, so no smoking history. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Um… now that you mention it, I have been a little tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. I thought it was just… the summer heat. And… sometimes I have a little pain in my chest. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It comes and goes. I don’t think much of it, usually. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: It could be related, yes. Fatigue and chest pain are both things we want to look into. Is the chest pain related to the coughing at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not always. Sometimes it happens after I cough, a little soreness, but sometimes it happens even when I haven’t coughed. It is… difficult to explain. It is not a bad pain, really. More… annoying, I think. And the fatigue… it’s just that I feel sleepy all the time, even after I sleep. It’s strange. I feel… old, sometimes. Perhaps I am just getting old.
DOCTOR: You're not just getting old, Jeannemarie. It's good you're telling me all of this—it helps me understand what's going on. Okay, so fatigue and chest pain, sometimes after coughing, sometimes not. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have always been very healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. When I was younger, the doctors said I had… a slightly irregular heartbeat, but they said it was nothing to worry about. They just told me to avoid… strenuous exercise. I have had regular check-ups every year, and everything was always fine. I used to see Doctor Tanaka, but he… he retired a few years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health, a slightly irregular heartbeat noted in the past, and you saw Doctor Tanaka previously. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very lucky. I broke my arm when I was a child, falling from a tree, but that was all. Just a cast for a few weeks. No… no surgeries, no hospital stays. I am usually very careful. My husband always said I was too cautious. He liked to tease me about it.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some trouble with his lungs when he was very old. The doctors said it was… emphysema, maybe? He smoked a lot, you see. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don't… I don’t know much about it. We didn’t talk about things like that very much in my family. It was considered… impolite, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother, some lung issues in your father, and breast cancer in your aunt. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any problems with medications before. I… I don't take any medications regularly, except for a little vitamin D in the winter. Doctor Tanaka said I was a little low. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Vitamin D is helpful, but it doesn’t sound like that’s related to what’s going on now. Okay, just to be thorough, do you drink alcohol, and do you use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not drink alcohol. And I have never used any tobacco products, as I said before. My husband… he liked a little sake sometimes, on special occasions, but I never cared for it. I prefer tea. Green tea, mostly. It’s much better for you, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Okay, so no alcohol or tobacco use. Alright, Jeannemarie, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that okay? I hope I am not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Good breath. Now another one, a little deeper if you can. Okay, I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, which you mentioned your previous doctor noted. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing on the lower lobes, especially when you exhale. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Could you please lie back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. Is the wheezing… is that bad? I am a little worried, Doctor. I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be worried, Jeannemarie, and I understand your concern. The wheezing isn't necessarily bad, but it suggests some inflammation in your airways. It could be caused by a number of things—a mild infection, allergies, or even just some irritation. I'm going to examine your throat now. Can you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… like that? Is that alright? My throat feels a little… scratchy, now that you mention it. Perhaps it is just the air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but there are no obvious signs of infection. I don't see any white patches or swelling. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 135/85, and your pulse is a little fast, 88 beats per minute. That could be from anxiety, or it could be related to the wheezing. Alright, Jeannemarie, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. An X-ray and a blood test… I trust your judgment. When will I get the results? I hope it is not anything too serious. I have… no one to help me if I get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jeannemarie, and I want to reassure you we'll get to the bottom of this. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for early next week to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an inhaler—a bronchodilator—to help open up your airways and ease any wheezing. It’s a common medication and shouldn’t have any major side effects, but please let me know if you experience anything unusual. And I'd like you to avoid strenuous exercise until we have the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. An inhaler and avoiding exercise… I can do that. And a follow-up appointment next week. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any specific symptoms I should watch out for? I just… I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Yes, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any of the following, please go to the emergency room immediately: shortness of breath at rest, chest pain that doesn't go away, or if you start coughing up a significant amount of blood—more than a few teaspoons. Also, if you develop a fever over 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, please seek medical attention. Otherwise, just try to rest and stay hydrated. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy electronically. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. Thank you again for everything. I will… I will rest and wait for the results. And I will be careful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’m optimistic we’ll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better soon. Here's a copy of the prescription and instructions for the inhaler. Take care, and I'll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
