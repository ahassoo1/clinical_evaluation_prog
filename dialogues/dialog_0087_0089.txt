DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been hurting quite a bit lately. I… it comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a sharp pain. It’s difficult to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to explain. We’ll take our time. “Sharp pain in the lower abdomen, comes and goes.” Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… that’s a good question. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t worsen after eating, or with activity… I suppose it just happens. Sometimes it’s worse at night, maybe? But even then, not always. Oh dear, I'm not being very helpful, am I? It just… comes.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly helpful, Ms. Glymph. It’s common for pain to not have an obvious trigger, and it's good you're trying to recall any patterns. “Pain not consistently related to meals or activity, possibly worse at night.” Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a dull ache, certainly. It’s… like a cramping, twisting sensation. And sharp, as I said. Very uncomfortable. It almost feels like… well, I had a similar pain many years ago, when I was younger… but it’s hard to recall the details. Everything feels a bit…fuzzy, you know? Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: “Cramping, twisting, sharp pain.” Yes, that’s helpful. It sounds quite unpleasant. And you mentioned a similar pain in the past. Do you recall why you were experiencing pain at that time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a very long time ago. I believe… it was around the time I was diagnosed with… SLE, I think it was called. Something like that. It was a complicated time, and my recollection is rather fragmented. The doctors said it was… an autoimmune condition. I don’t recall the specifics of the pain at the time, just that it was…debilitating.
DOCTOR: SLE – Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. Thank you for mentioning that. It's important information. And you recall pain being a component of that earlier illness?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. It wasn't just the pain, of course. There was fatigue, and… rashes, I think. A great deal of being unwell, generally. But the pain… yes, it was definitely a part of it. Though, whether this current pain is the same as that… that’s what worries me, I suppose. It's unsettling when things start to feel familiar when they shouldn't.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It's good we're considering that history. Now, let's talk a bit about your current medications and any other medical conditions you're managing. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I have a few. There’s… Plaquenil, I believe. And a low dose of Prednisone, for the… flares, I suppose they call them. And sometimes, if the pain is particularly bad, the doctor prescribes something for the pain itself. But I can't recall the name, unfortunately. I take them regularly, though, to manage the…condition.
DOCTOR: Plaquenil and Prednisone, good. The EHR confirms those, and lists Naproxen as needed for pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Naproxen, yes! That sounds right. Thank you for reminding me. As for allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don't believe so. No, I don’t think I have any known allergies. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a penicillin derivative many years ago. But I haven’t had that issue since, and that was… decades ago. I am unsure if that still counts, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Noted, Ms. Glymph. A past reaction to penicillin is helpful to know. And now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit of a difficult question. My family… well, it’s a rather scattered history. I wasn’t particularly close to most of them, and I don’t recall anyone having anything… serious. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… I’m afraid I don’t remember. He passed away when I was quite young. I apologize for being so vague. My memory is simply not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You’ve provided what you recall, and that's what matters. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Just… please be gentle. I’m rather… sensitive, at the moment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. We will be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Hmm… bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, but they seem a little…hypoactive. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen now. Tell me if you feel any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not yet. That’s…not uncomfortable. Though… as you move lower, towards my… lower abdomen, it does become a bit… tender. Yes. There. On the left side, mostly. It’s not a sharp pain, not right now. But it’s…unpleasant. It’s difficult to describe. Almost a dull ache, combined with a… tightness?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Tenderness to palpation in the left lower abdomen. Is there any pain when I release the pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When you release… it's a bit sharper then. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It’s almost like a…twinge. And just… a general feeling of discomfort. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly, but it's definitely worse when you let go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Some tenderness with rebound. No guarding noted. Flanks are clear to percussion. Based on what you've told me, and my examination, the tenderness in your left lower abdomen, combined with your history of SLE, raises a few possibilities. We need to rule out a flare of your lupus, but we also need to consider other potential causes of abdominal pain. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP. I’d also like to order a urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, please do them. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what's going on. The uncertainty is… unsettling. I just hope it’s not a flare-up. Those are… unpleasant, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. We’ll get these tests ordered, and hopefully, they'll give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a medication to help manage the pain. I'm prescribing a low dose of Tramadol as needed. Please take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the tests and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Tramadol… I believe I’ve heard of that. As needed… that sounds sensible. And a follow-up next week… that’s reassuring. Thank you. I feel… slightly better, just knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out. It’s just… nice to feel heard, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It's my job to listen and help you figure things out. That's what I'm here for. I’ve sent the lab orders electronically to the lab across the street. They should be ready for you when you are. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your patience, especially with my… fragmented memory. I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and get some rest.
