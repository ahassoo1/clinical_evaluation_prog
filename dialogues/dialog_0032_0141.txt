DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. All over, really. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not a serious thing, I don’t think, but very… persistent.
DOCTOR: “A few weeks,” you say. Alright. And is it…localized to any particular areas, or truly all over as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Truly all over, Doctor. It started on my arms, I think, just a little bit, and then spread. Now it's my legs, my back, even my…well, everywhere. It doesn't feel like a rash, exactly. More like…a constant need to scratch. It doesn't really look like anything's there, either. Just red when I've been at it for a bit.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed recently, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really. My routine’s been the same for… well, for a long time now. I get up, I have coffee, I read the news, I walk the dog… same as always. I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, haven't eaten anything particularly strange… Oh! Well, my neighbor gave me some peaches a couple of weeks ago, right around the time it started. But I’ve eaten peaches before with no problem. It's a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Peaches are…unlikely, but we must consider all possibilities. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribed for my blood pressure, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? Small dose, and it seems to be doing its job. Other than that, nothing. No vitamins, no supplements, just…the Lisinopril. I take it every morning, with my coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a kid, but that cleared up years ago. I've had all sorts of vaccinations, of course, being from Russia and then living here… nothing ever bothered me. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. Honestly, I’m usually quite healthy. It's just this itch! It’s… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to take a look at your skin, Mr. Ferneding. Please, if you wouldn’t mind, I’ll need you to loosen your shirt and trousers so I can get a good view. We need to rule out any obvious dermatological causes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. It's not much to look at, I assure you. Pale skin, a few age spots… but as I said, nothing remarkable. Just this infernal itching. You’ll probably be disappointed.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The skin appears largely unremarkable, as you said. No visible rash, excoriations are minimal. I do notice a slight dryness, especially along your back and flanks. And the skin feels…slightly warm to the touch. It's subtle, but present. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor, not that I've noticed. And no chills either. A little tired, maybe, but that's just getting older, I suppose. I walk the dog every day, so I am usually a bit worn out by evening. But nothing more than usual. It's just…a general feeling of being a bit…off. But it's hard to say if that’s related to the itching or just… life. This whole thing is so frustrating. It's not serious, but it’s persistent, and it’s driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms – any changes in bowel habits, any joint pain, any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: No changes in bowel habits, Doctor. Everything’s… regular, shall we say? No joint pain at all. And no weight loss, thankfully. I actually worry about gaining weight, if I'm honest. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. No, nothing else. Just… this itch. And the vague feeling of being a bit…unsettled. Like something’s not quite right, but I can't put my finger on it. It’s probably just my age, though. An old man’s worries, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Based on my examination, there are no immediately obvious dermatological causes for your itching. The absence of a rash, the minimal excoriations, and the absence of other systemic symptoms are…reassuring, to some extent. However, the persistent nature of your itch, combined with the mild warmth of your skin, warrants further investigation. It's possible this is a mild allergic reaction, despite your report of no new exposures. Or it could be related to your medication. While unlikely, we must also consider rarer possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to order a liver function test. We will also test for any signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: That… sounds thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood tests, you say? No problem at all. I’ve had plenty of those over the years. Honestly, I was hoping it was just something simple. A lotion, perhaps? But if you think blood tests are necessary, then I trust your judgment. When will I hear back about the results? And will I need to do anything special before the test? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’d like you to fast for 12 hours prior to the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, just water is permissible. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. You can access them through the patient portal, or my office will contact you with the results and discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, I recommend you try an over-the-counter antihistamine, such as cetirizine. And avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. Should your symptoms worsen significantly – fever, chills, significant rash, or any difficulty breathing – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions regarding this plan?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds…reasonable, Doctor. Fasting, antihistamines, gentle soaps… I can manage that. And I'll be sure to contact you if anything gets worse, though I sincerely hope it doesn't. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. It’s good to know someone’s taking it seriously, even if it’s probably just… old age. I think that's all my questions, for now. I’ll go schedule the blood tests and hopefully get some answers soon.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Ferneding. I will be in touch. And please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. .
