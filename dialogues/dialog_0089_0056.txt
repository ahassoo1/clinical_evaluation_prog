DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Honestly, it’s… a rather tedious matter. Burnout, I believe the young people call it. From the university. All these… expectations. It’s quite draining, you understand. I’d rather not dwell on the specifics if possible. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Burnout” can certainly be draining, and it’s good you're addressing it. Just to clarify, are you experiencing symptoms related to this burnout – things like fatigue, difficulty concentrating, changes in sleep or appetite, perhaps feeling overwhelmed or losing interest in things you usually enjoy?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens, are you a doctor or an interrogator? Honestly, I simply feel… tired. A general lack of enthusiasm. And frankly, these students are… less and less appreciative of proper scholarship these days. Is that a symptom? I’m not sure I follow. It's all rather… undignified to dissect one’s feelings like this.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as abrupt, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s just my habit to gather as much information as possible to ensure I understand what’s going on. “Tired” and “lack of enthusiasm” are certainly important things to discuss. And yes, feeling frustrated with your students can contribute to the overall picture. To help me get a better idea of things, could you tell me a bit about how long you've been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I suppose. Years, possibly. It all blurs together after a while. University life is… cyclical. Bad semesters, slightly less bad semesters. It’s hardly a recent development. I’m not entirely sure why we’re cataloging the duration, though. Is there a point to all of this? I have a luncheon appointment, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you sharing that. Knowing roughly how long these feelings have been present helps me determine if something has changed recently, or if this is a more longstanding pattern. It also guides what tests, if any, might be helpful. Before we get to tests, though, let's just cover some basics. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep – difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or perhaps sleeping more than usual?
PATIENT: Changes in sleep? Well, I sleep. Eventually. What do you expect, at my age? It's not as… restorative as it once was, naturally. But I wouldn't call it a problem. I wake up. I go to work. It's a routine. Are we going to discuss the minutiae of my bedtime now? Really. I’m beginning to suspect this was a mistake.
DOCTOR: Alright. I apologize again for the line of questioning, Mr. Schlatterer. Let's shift gears then. Are you experiencing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? I eat. When I’m hungry. And frankly, the university cafeteria has… declined in quality over the years. So, some days I eat less. Some days I eat a little more, just to be polite to the staff. It’s hardly a medical crisis, Doctor. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Based on what you’ve shared, it sounds like you’re experiencing a degree of ongoing fatigue and dissatisfaction, potentially related to the stressors of your work. While it doesn’t present as an acute medical problem, chronic stress can impact overall well-being. I would recommend prioritizing self-care activities – things that you find relaxing and enjoyable. If these feelings persist or worsen, I can provide you with a referral to a therapist who specializes in stress management and burnout. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: A therapist? Good heavens, no! I've survived 87 years without needing someone to… manage my feelings. I simply wanted to rule out anything… physical. And frankly, I’ve wasted quite enough time on this. Thank you, Doctor. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. If you change your mind about the referral, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you all the best. .
