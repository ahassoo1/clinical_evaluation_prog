DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I should come in. Something about papers… for… time off? I’m not quite sure, to be honest. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I think it has to do with my work, but… she handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Papers for time off. Well, it’s good your wife is looking out for you. It’s… unusual for a patient to come in without a clear idea of why they’re here. But alright. Let's try to figure it out. Perhaps we can start with what’s been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Bothering me… hmm. Well, I’ve been… tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And a little… shaky. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. It's hard to explain. I do a lot of work with the church, you see. Directing things, teaching… keeps me busy. Maybe it’s just that? It's been going on for… a while now, I suppose. Months, definitely. I don’t really keep track of dates. My wife would know better.
DOCTOR: Months, you say. And this tiredness and shakiness… does it interfere with your activities at the church?
PATIENT: Well, it makes it harder to… focus, sometimes. When I'm leading a group, I have to really think about what I'm saying, instead of just… knowing it. And I get a little flustered easier, I think. I don't like to bother anyone with it, so I just push through. My wife says I look pale sometimes, too. She worries a lot. I try to tell her it’s nothing, but… she’s pretty insistent. She’s the one who made the appointment, you know. I don’t really do doctors.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good you have a wife who's attentive. Pushing through things isn't always the best idea, you know. It’s better to get things checked out. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! Sometimes my hands tremble when I'm writing. Not constantly, just… when I’m trying to be precise. And I… I think I’ve been losing weight, but I haven’t really been paying attention. I like my food, you see. I haven’t changed what I eat. My wife might have noticed. She’s very observant. Is this… is this what the papers are for? For getting time off because I'm… not well? I'm really not sure what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tremors and potential weight loss. Okay. And has anything specific triggered this weight loss or these tremors?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed. It just… gradually started. I haven’t been under any extra stress, really. Church work is… demanding, yes, but it’s also… fulfilling. I enjoy it. I suppose… maybe the weather? It’s been very hot lately. But I don’t think that would… cause tremors, would it? I really don’t know, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. This is all a bit… overwhelming. I just want to go home and have a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it sounds like you're experiencing some… vague symptoms. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can do a neurological exam to assess the tremors. It's standard procedure. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Just… please be quick, if you could? I do have a meeting with the choir later this afternoon. I wouldn't want to miss that. And… will this tell us about the papers? If I do need time off, that is. My wife will be very relieved.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get started then. Please sit back and relax. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, can you extend your arms in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Like this? It feels a little strange. I haven’t done this sort of thing in… decades. Is that… is that what you’re looking for? The shaking? My wife always said I had shaky hands. She said it was a family trait. Though, I don’t remember anyone else having this problem. It's all a bit… fuzzy, you see. Will this tell us if I need those papers?
DOCTOR: Yes, the shaking is what I’m looking for. And the coordination. There is some tremor present, and a slight difficulty with coordination. It’s subtle, but it's there. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished. Alright. That's enough for a preliminary exam. We'll need to run some blood tests to rule out anything serious, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. And given the tremor and coordination issues, I’m going to recommend a neurological consultation.
PATIENT: A neurological… consultation? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I just want to be able to keep doing my work. I don’t want to worry my wife, you see. And those papers… will I get them? If I do need time off, what do I tell the church? They’re counting on me for the summer festival. This is all a bit overwhelming. Maybe a cup of tea would help.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, let’s not jump to conclusions. A neurological consultation simply means we're getting a specialist’s opinion. It doesn’t automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It’s a precautionary measure. As for the blood tests, we need to see what’s going on internally before we can say anything definitive. Worrying won't help. We're going to gather information, and then we'll make a plan. As for the time off… we'll see what the tests reveal. I can write a note excusing you from work for a week, pending the results. You can tell the church you have a doctor's appointment and are following up on some health concerns. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A week… yes, that would be… helpful. A week would give me time to… think. And my wife would be relieved. She always worries so much. A note… yes, that’s good. Excusing me from work. That will do. And the blood tests… where do I go for those? And the neurological… consultation? Do I need a referral? This is a lot to remember. My wife usually handles all of this. Perhaps if you could just write everything down for me? That would be very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here. This is a requisition form for the blood tests. You can go to any lab, but I recommend Pacific Labs – it’s just down the street. And this… …is a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist. Her office is in the City Center. You'll need to call and schedule an appointment. Her number is on the form. I’ve also written down the Pacific Labs address and phone number. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I think so. Pacific Labs… and Dr. Sharma. City Center. And the number… yes, there it is. Thank you, Doctor. This is very… helpful. So… about those papers… the ones for time off… you can write that note, right? For a week? Just to be safe? My wife will be very happy. And I do have that meeting with the choir… I wouldn't want to disappoint them.
DOCTOR: Here. “Ronnald Limtiaco requires one week of medical leave, August 2nd – August 9th. Follow-up with primary care physician and neurologist recommended.” There. Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… helpful. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? The blood tests, the neurologist… and the note for the choir. Well, thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. And… if you don’t mind… could you just tell me again where Pacific Labs is located? Just to be sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s on Elm Street, just two blocks down from the clinic. You can’t miss it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Get the tests done as soon as possible, and schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Yes… Elm Street. Right. Thank you again, Doctor. I will… try not to worry. Have a good day.
