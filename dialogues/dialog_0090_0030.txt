DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I've noticed a change in how I smell... my body odor, I guess you'd call it. It's just... different than usual.
DOCTOR: Different how, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It's…sweeter, I think. Not like I’m smelling bad, necessarily, just…not me. I usually don't have much of an odor at all, but this is noticeable, even after a normal shower. It started maybe a week or two ago, I'd say.
DOCTOR: Sweeter, you say. And has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Same job, same everything, mostly. I haven’t changed my soap or deodorant. I did start taking a new vitamin, though. A multivitamin. It’s one my daughter recommended – said it would give me more energy for work. It’s…I think it’s called “Vitality Boost.” Does that sound like anything? I don't really know what's in it.
DOCTOR: Well, vitamins can sometimes cause changes. But we need to rule other things out first. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… not that I’ve noticed. No fever, no weight loss, no new rashes. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, at my age, who isn’t tired? I guess… sometimes I feel a little warm, kind of flushed, but that could just be the weather. It’s been awfully hot lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And…I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful? I go for my yearly checkups and everything.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful, yes. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And…oh! And I take a calcium supplement with Vitamin D, because my doctor said my levels were a little low last year. That's about it. And the Vitality Boost vitamin, of course, but I just started that recently. I can get you the bottles if you need to see the ingredients.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright for now. We can look those up later. Now, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten shellfish my whole life, been around cats and dogs, no problems. My daughter asked me once if I'd ever been stung by a bee, and I don't think so. It's never been an issue. I really don't have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother…my grandmother…she had heart problems. That's about all I can really remember, to be honest. No one really talked much about health stuff when I was growing up. My dad was pretty healthy until he got old, and then it was just…old age stuff. I don't recall any cancers or anything like that on either side. Is that helpful? It's not a very long history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… okay. I'm divorced, been that way for about ten years now. I live alone. I work full time, as I mentioned, floor laying. I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. I don't use any recreational drugs. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t go out much, just work and take care of the house, mostly. I have my daughter and grandkids, I see them on weekends. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's sufficient. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to step on the scale and we'll check your vitals, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general appearance. Just a standard check, to make sure nothing obvious is going on. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Here we go. I hope I haven’t gained too much weight! It’s hard to resist a good Ethiopian stew, you know?
DOCTOR: 134 pounds. Not bad at all. Height is 164 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 164 centimeters. I always have to remind people to convert it to feet and inches! Everything's metric everywhere else.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No murmurs or wheezing. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. No noticeable edema. Now, let’s just take a look in your mouth and throat... open wide, please.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I brush regularly, I promise! I'm very careful with my teeth. My daughter is a dental hygienist, so she keeps me on the straight and narrow.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Oral mucosa appears normal, no lesions or inflammation. No pharyngeal erythema. Alright, Ms. Purtee. Based on your history and this brief exam, it’s difficult to say definitively what's causing the change in your body odor. However, given the recent start of the Vitality Boost multivitamin, that's the most likely culprit. Some vitamins can cause a change in body odor due to metabolic byproducts. It's not usually anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That makes sense, I guess. So, you think it’s the vitamin? I was a little worried it was something else, something… serious. So, what do you suggest I do? Stop taking it, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Exactly. I recommend discontinuing the Vitality Boost multivitamin and see if your body odor returns to normal. It may take a few days to a week for the effects to wear off. If the odor persists after that, or if you develop any other symptoms - fever, weight loss, night sweats – then we'll need to investigate further. But frankly, I highly doubt that will be necessary. We can also run some basic blood tests if you're particularly anxious about it, just to rule things out, but I don't believe it's warranted at this time. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Well, that's a relief, I suppose. I just... I didn't expect a vitamin to do that. I guess everything affects you differently. No, I think that about covers it. I guess I'll just stop taking the vitamin and see what happens. Thank you, Doctor Kur. You've put my mind at ease. Should I make a follow-up appointment, or…?
DOCTOR: No, a follow-up isn't necessary unless the odor persists. If it doesn't resolve within a couple of weeks, then schedule an appointment, and we'll discuss it further. But I strongly suspect it's just the vitamin. I’ll document our findings here. Alright, you’re all set, Ms. Purtee. Have a good day. Next!
