DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, Doctor... Piet, is it? Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always going. More than I used to, anyway. It’s a nuisance, really. I don't recall exactly when it started, but it's been... a while. Just a general annoyance, to be frank. Not a big deal, I suppose, but my wife keeps nagging me about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing more frequent urination than usual. And it's been going on for a while now. Your wife has noticed, too. That’s good she’s paying attention. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More than a “little,” Doctor. It's constant. Though… constant might be an exaggeration. It's not like I'm running to the toilet every five minutes, but… well, it's enough. Enough to be bothersome. And at night! That's the worst part. Waking up… I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to, that’s for sure. It’s probably just old age, though. Everything goes when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent urination, particularly bothersome at night – that’s called nocturia. And you’re right to mention it disrupts your sleep. It's not necessarily just old age, Mr. Segretto, although aging can contribute. We need to figure out what's causing it. Do you feel like you’re able to fully empty your bladder each time, or do you feel like you still need to go shortly after?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. You know, I hadn't really thought about it. I suppose… mostly. I mean, I don't feel like I'm leaving a whole lot behind, but sometimes… sometimes I get the feeling there’s a little bit left. Not much, mind you. Just a feeling. It's hard to explain. I usually just go again to be sure. Better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes you feel like you don't fully empty, and you go back to try again. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned this has been going on for a while. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed...? Well… let me see. My grandson visited last month. Brought his… what do you call them… a drone. Annoying little thing buzzing around. Kept nearly hitting the barn. That's about it, I suppose. No, wait. My wife changed the laundry detergent. Something with… aloe vera, I think? She says it smells nicer. Everything smells nice these days, if you ask me. Too much perfume, not enough substance. But no, I don't think that's it. Nothing major has changed.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in your routine or diet. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, besides the frequent urination and sometimes feeling like you don’t fully empty, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other symptoms? Well… my knees ache, if that counts. And my back. Everything aches when you get old, Doctor. Is that what you mean? No, I don't have a fever or anything. No pain when I go… usually. Sometimes, a little bit of… discomfort. But nothing I'd call pain. And no, I don't see any… blood or anything like that. Just the going. A lot of the going.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no pain with urination – just occasional discomfort. And no blood in your urine. Good. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My doctor… the old one… told me my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. Put me on a… a pill. I took it for a while, then I forgot about it. My wife keeps telling me to take it, but I feel fine. And… I had a hernia, I think. Years and years ago. They fixed it. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, if you ask me. I used to be a strong farmer, you know. Still am, in my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication you aren't currently taking, and a hernia repair years ago. Do you remember the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, names… now you’re asking the hard questions. Let me see… it was a little white pill… no, a little blue pill. I think it started with an 'H'. Or maybe a 'P'? No, 'H' definitely. My wife would know, but she’s at the garden club meeting right now. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay attention to those things. Pills are pills. They make you feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little blue pill, possibly starting with an 'H'. We can look that up later. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just what my wife gives me. She's always trying to get me to take something. Fish oil, I think? For my brain. Says I'm forgetful. Which is… well, not entirely wrong. And… something for my joints. Glucosamine? Chondroitin? They all sound the same to me. Little capsules. I take them with my breakfast. Don’t really notice a difference, but she insists.
DOCTOR: Alright, fish oil and something for your joints – glucosamine and chondroitin, likely. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've never been allergic to anything. Ate all sorts of things growing up on the farm. Dust, pollen… a little bit of everything. My wife says I'm a tough old bird. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… now that's a long story. My father, he was a strong man. Lived to be 85, but he had… I think it was heart trouble. And my mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. Couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. And my brother… he had some kind of trouble with his… his kidneys, I think. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t remember much about it. They’re all gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother, and kidney problems in your brother. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Segretto, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds fine. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Though, I warn you, my heart's a bit stubborn. Been through a lot. Just be gentle, alright? And try not to poke too much. My wife gets upset if I complain.
DOCTOR: Very good. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a little… irregular. Not alarming, but worth noting. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: No pain, not really. Just… a bit of pressure, I suppose. Like a full stomach after a good meal. Though, I haven't had a good meal in a while. My wife is always watching my portions. She says I need to lose weight. It’s a conspiracy, I tell you. A conspiracy to deprive me of good food. But no, no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And the other side. Good reflexes. Finally, I’m going to do a quick prostate exam. It's a standard part of the exam for men your age, and it helps us rule out some potential causes of your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. That… that’s not my favorite part. But I suppose if you have to… Just be quick about it, alright? And try not to make a fuss. My pride is a sensitive thing, you know. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Segretto. That’s all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but no concerning lumps or tenderness. Alright, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia – BPH – which is an enlarged prostate. It’s very common in men your age, and it can cause frequent urination, especially at night. The irregularity in your heartbeat is something we need to keep an eye on as well.
PATIENT: Benign… what did you call it? BPH? Sounds complicated. So, it’s just… my old prostate getting bigger? That’s all? Is there anything you can do about it? I don’t want to be running to the bathroom all day. And this heart… is it serious? I still need to manage the farm, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, BPH is when the prostate gland gets larger with age. It's very common, and often not serious, but it can be bothersome. And regarding your heart, the irregularity isn’t immediately alarming, but we'll want to investigate it further. I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection or other problems. I'm also going to order a PSA test – that’s a blood test to measure the level of prostate-specific antigen, which can help us assess your prostate health. And finally, I’m going to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram – to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests, tests… always tests. Alright, I suppose if you think it's necessary. But don’t keep me waiting too long for the results, alright? I have things to do. And I don’t want to be poked and prodded anymore than I have to be. What exactly will these tests tell you? Will they fix it? Is there a pill I can take?
DOCTOR: The urinalysis will check for any infection or other issues in your urine, and the PSA test will give us a baseline measurement of your prostate health. The EKG will tell us more about your heart rhythm, and whether any further investigation is needed. There are several treatment options for BPH. Some lifestyle changes, like reducing caffeine and fluids before bedtime, can help. There are also medications that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, or shrink the prostate. We'll discuss those options once we have the results of the tests. For your heart, we'll see what the EKG shows. If it shows an abnormality, we might need to consult with a cardiologist. Here are the lab orders. The front desk will schedule those for you. They'll want your insurance information. Once you have the results, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Questions... yes, a few. What about my knees? They ache terribly when it rains. Does this… BPH… have anything to do with that? And will these tests cost me a fortune? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know. My wife will have my hide if I rack up too many bills.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Segretto, BPH shouldn’t affect your knees. Knee pain is likely related to arthritis or wear and tear. We can discuss that at a separate appointment if it continues to bother you. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover most of these tests, but there may be a copay or deductible. The office staff can help you understand the potential costs and submit the claims to Medicare. They're very familiar with the process. I've also included a note about your knee pain in your chart, so we can address it in the future. Are there any other questions I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: Alright… I suppose that's all for now. My head is swimming with all these… tests and… BPH. Just remind me again, what do I tell my wife? She’ll want to know everything. And she always has a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: Tell her you visited the doctor today, and we're running some routine tests to investigate your frequent urination. Explain that we’re checking for an enlarged prostate and also looking at your heart rhythm. Tell her you’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results, and we'll discuss a plan. And tell her you’re taking things one step at a time. Here’s a summary of our visit. It includes the tests we ordered and the main points we discussed. It might help you remember everything. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… manageable. A summary… good idea. My brain isn’t what it used to be. No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient with an old man. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go find my wife and try to explain all this before she starts worrying.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
