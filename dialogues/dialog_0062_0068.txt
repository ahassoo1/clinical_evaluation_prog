DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's… the swelling. After the cancer, you know? It’s just… puffy. Mostly in my legs, but sometimes my arms too. It’s been happening for a little while now. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling after cancer treatment is definitely something we want to look into. It's good you're bringing this up. “Puffy” is a good way to describe it. And you said it's been happening for a little while – can you give me a rough idea of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe two months ago? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it's not so bad, and other days… it’s really noticeable. I don’t really feel sick, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fluctuating swelling is common. Okay, so two months of intermittent swelling, mostly in your legs and sometimes your arms, and you're not experiencing any other symptoms like pain, fever, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, no fever or anything like that. Just… heavy. Like I said, my legs feel very heavy sometimes. And a little achy, but not painful pain, you know? Just… tired. Like they’ve been working too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, "heavy" and "tired" – I'm getting a good picture. And you've noticed this mostly in your legs and arms?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes my hands too, but not often. It’s mostly the legs, definitely. And it’s worse if I stand for a long time. If I can sit and put my feet up, it helps a bit.
DOCTOR: Good to know that elevation helps. That’s a helpful clue. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, can you tell me a little bit about the cancer treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh… um. It was… a long time ago now. Chemotherapy, mostly. And radiation. It was for… breast cancer. They said it was… stage two? I don’t remember all the details. It was… difficult. I finished it about five years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years post-treatment for stage two breast cancer with chemotherapy and radiation. Thank you for sharing that. That’s important information. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the usual things for my blood pressure. A little pill every day. And… no, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in… well, ever. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. What's the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… oh dear. I always forget these names. It’s a little white pill… it starts with an “A”, I think? My husband used to remind me, but… he’s not here anymore. Sorry, I’m not very good with these things. I just know to take it every morning.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Sasha. It's very common to forget medication names, especially with everything else you've been through. Don't worry about it at all. We can look it up in your records if that's okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please do! That would be wonderful. I’m hopeless with those names. Anything to help you figure out what’s going on with my legs. It’s just… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’re taking Amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure. That’s helpful. Now, let's take a look at your legs and arms. I’m just going to do a quick physical exam to assess the swelling and check for anything else that might be contributing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope it’s not serious. My legs have been bothering me more lately, even with putting them up.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a look. I'm noticing some swelling in both legs, more prominent on the left. And yes, there is some pitting edema present. I’m also going to check the pulses in your feet to make sure circulation is good. Pulses feel good and strong in both feet, which is reassuring. I’m also going to auscultate your heart and lungs just to get a complete picture. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. One last thing – I'll check the skin on your legs for any signs of infection, like redness or warmth. Skin looks good, no signs of infection. So, good pulses, normal heart and lungs, no skin changes, but definitely some swelling and pitting edema, especially in your left leg. This is consistent with lymphedema or venous insufficiency, but we’ll need to do some further investigation to determine the exact cause.
PATIENT: Lymphedema… that sounds… scary. Is that from the cancer? And venous… what was it? I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m getting a bit confused.
DOCTOR: It's okay, Sasha, it's perfectly normal to feel confused. Let’s break it down. Lymphedema is a buildup of fluid in the tissues because of a blockage in the lymphatic system. It can happen as a side effect of cancer treatment, particularly after removal of lymph nodes. And sometimes it can develop years later. Venous insufficiency, on the other hand, is when the veins in your legs don't return blood to the heart as well as they should. This can also cause swelling. Both can cause similar symptoms, which is why we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a Doppler ultrasound of both legs. This will help us visualize the veins and check for any blockages or valve problems. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A Doppler… that sounds… complicated. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I just… I want to get this sorted. It’s just uncomfortable, and I worry it’s something serious coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A Doppler ultrasound is non-invasive – it just uses sound waves to create an image of your veins. It doesn't hurt at all. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's happening in your legs. I’ll write the order now and we can get that scheduled for you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your legs whenever possible, and wearing compression stockings. They can help to reduce the swelling. Do you have any compression stockings currently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve never worn them before. My husband… he used to take care of all that. I didn’t even know they had compression stockings. Where would I get those? And… are they expensive?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Sasha. You're not alone in not knowing about compression stockings. They're available at most pharmacies, or medical supply stores. They come in different levels of compression, and it's best to get fitted properly to ensure you get the right ones. I can write you a prescription for them, and recommend a local store that does fittings. They can be a bit expensive, depending on the level of compression and quality, but your insurance, Medicare, should cover a portion of the cost with a prescription. We can check your coverage details at the front desk if you’d like. For now, let’s focus on getting the ultrasound scheduled. We'll get those results back, and then we can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Getting the ultrasound is the most important thing, I think. And checking with Medicare… that would be wonderful. I don’t want to have to worry about the cost on top of everything else. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I’m happy to help. It's completely understandable to be worried, and I want to make sure we address all your concerns. Okay, I'm ordering the Doppler ultrasound now and the nurse will schedule that for you before you leave. I'm also sending a prescription for compression stockings to your pharmacy. They’ll be able to help you with sizing. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden increase in swelling, redness, pain, or warmth in your legs, please call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just… relieved to be getting something done. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I think I'm ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help ease your worries a bit. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the ultrasound instructions and schedule that for you. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns that come up before your appointment. Here’s a printed summary of everything we discussed today. Take care, and I'll see you after your ultrasound.
