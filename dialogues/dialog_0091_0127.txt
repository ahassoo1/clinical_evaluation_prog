DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be frank. I've noticed my muscles getting weaker, and my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s not sudden, it’s been happening gradually, but it’s definitely noticeable now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schaust. Gradual onset of muscle weakness and drooping eyelids is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the weakness a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I think, with my arms. Just feeling a bit… tired, more easily than usual. Now, it’s in my legs too. It’s not painful, exactly, just… harder to do things. Like, carrying groceries is more of an effort. And climbing stairs… well, I take them slower now. It’s hard to explain, it’s just… less strength, I suppose. It's mostly in my limbs, I haven't noticed anything in my face except for the eyelids, of course.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, the weakness is primarily in your arms and legs, and it’s progressed over time. You haven’t noticed any weakness in your trunk or any difficulty with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Everything else feels… normal, if that makes sense. I can still talk and swallow just fine. It really is mostly just my arms and legs. And the eyelids, which I keep having to blink to keep open. It's... a bit distracting, to be honest. I hadn't thought much of it until it started affecting things, like driving.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. The fact that it’s primarily in your limbs and hasn’t affected your speech or swallowing is helpful information. And I appreciate you mentioning the impact on driving – that is certainly concerning. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, that sort of thing. Broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but it healed perfectly. No surgeries or anything like that. And I don’t really take any regular medication. Just… over-the-counter painkillers for headaches occasionally. Oh, and I was divorced about six months ago. Does that count? It was… stressful, but I’m managing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schaust. It's good to know there's no significant past medical or surgical history. And while a stressful life event certainly can have an impact on your health, for now, we’ll focus on the physical symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with insect stings or anything like that. My ex-wife was quite allergic to pollen, but thankfully, I didn’t inherit that particular gene! Is that… relevant? Sorry, I didn’t mean to ramble.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schaust. No need to apologize. Knowing you have no known allergies is helpful. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm. My mother is still alive, she's 78 and relatively healthy, though she has some arthritis. My father passed away about ten years ago, from a heart attack. He was a smoker, unfortunately. As for siblings… I have one sister, she lives in Stockholm. She seems perfectly fine, no health problems that I know of. And… that’s about it, really. We weren’t a particularly… medical family, if that makes sense. No history of anything like this that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing your father’s history of heart disease and your mother’s arthritis is good to know. And the fact that you don’t have a family history of neuromuscular conditions is also helpful information. Just a few more questions before we proceed with a physical examination. Could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I work as a facilities manager, so I'm on my feet a fair bit, though mostly indoors. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I live alone now, since the divorce, and I don't have any pets. I try to eat a balanced diet, but… it’s sometimes difficult when you’re on your own. I don't really have any hobbies to speak of, unfortunately. Mostly just… watching television and reading. I suppose I’m not very exciting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. That gives me a good overview. It’s helpful to know about your work, lifestyle, and diet. Now, I’d like to conduct a physical examination. We'll start with a neurological assessment, checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope it won't take too long… not that I have anything pressing, but… you know. Just eager to get to the bottom of things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It may take a few minutes, but we’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. First, could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is there anything specific I need to do? Relax, I suppose? I’ll try my best. This table is rather… firm.
DOCTOR: Yes, just relax as much as possible. Okay, I'm just going to check your pupillary response to light and your cranial nerve function. Normal pupillary constriction bilaterally. Cranial nerves II-XII appear intact. Now, I’m going to check your strength. I’d like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. I test grip strength bilaterally. Right hand: 4/5. Left hand: 4/5. Now, I’d like you to resist as I try to move your arms up and down. I test upper extremity strength bilaterally. Right arm: 4/5. Left arm: 4/5. Next, let’s check your legs. I test lower extremity strength bilaterally. Right leg: 4+/5. Left leg: 4+/5.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm trying… is that enough? I feel a little… weak, even doing that. It is getting harder. I’m trying to push back, honestly. It feels like… there’s just less power. I can feel it. Is that… normal? It doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. I appreciate your effort. And you are right to notice that it is requiring more effort. I document the findings. Overall, strength is 4/5 in upper extremities, 4+/5 in lower extremities. Patient reports fatigue with effort. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I test biceps, triceps, brachioradialis, patellar, and Achilles reflexes bilaterally. Biceps, triceps, brachioradialis reflexes are 2+/2+ bilaterally. Patellar reflexes are 2+/2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are 1+/2+ bilaterally. Finally, I'm going to test your coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Okay, like this? Is that alright? I hope I'm not making a mess of it. It feels a little… off. Not smooth, like it used to be. I used to be quite coordinated, I played a bit of tennis when I was younger. But it’s been a while. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schaust. I observe your coordination. Finger-to-nose test demonstrates mild dysmetria bilaterally. Okay, that’s all for the physical examination for now. I've documented my findings. I pause, reviewing the notes on my tablet. Based on your symptoms and the findings of the examination – gradual onset muscle weakness, drooping eyelids, mild dysmetria, and somewhat diminished reflexes – I have some initial thoughts, but I need to order some blood work to help narrow down the possibilities. I suspect we need to rule out things like myasthenia gravis, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or even consider vitamin deficiencies. I will order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin D level, and acetylcholine receptor antibodies. I will also order creatine kinase level. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Those… those sound like complicated words. Are they serious things? Myasthenia… and the other one? I just… I want to know what’s happening. Is it something I should be worried about? I'm happy to have the tests, I just… I'd appreciate it if you could explain what they’re looking for, in plain English. And what the next steps would be, depending on the results. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust, and I’m happy to explain everything as clearly as possible. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when facing uncertainty. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between nerves and muscles, leading to weakness and fatigue. The acetylcholine receptor antibody test helps determine if your body is producing antibodies that interfere with this connection. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is another autoimmune disorder, but it affects a different part of the nerve-muscle connection. The comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count will give us a general overview of your overall health and can help rule out other potential causes of weakness, such as electrolyte imbalances or vitamin deficiencies. Checking your thyroid function is also important, as thyroid disorders can sometimes cause similar symptoms. The creatine kinase level helps assess muscle damage. The next step is to draw blood for these tests. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have those results, we can determine the best course of action. If the tests suggest myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton, we may need to perform further testing, such as a nerve conduction study and electromyography . Depending on the diagnosis, treatment options may include medications, lifestyle changes, or, in some cases, surgery. Does that explanation make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that makes a little more sense. Autoimmune… so my body is attacking itself? That sounds… unpleasant. And the other one, Lambert-Eaton, is that also attacking itself? I’m a bit worried about the… further testing you mentioned. Nerve conduction… and what was the other one, EMG? That sounds… invasive. But I understand why you need to do them. If that’s what it takes to find out what’s going on, then I’m happy to cooperate. When would I be able to get the blood work done? And how long will it take to get the results back, roughly? I’m just… trying to plan things. I work full-time, so I need to arrange time off if I need it.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Mr. Schaust. Autoimmune disorders do involve the body attacking itself, but there are effective treatments available to manage the condition and improve your quality of life. Nerve conduction studies and EMG do involve small needles and electrical stimulation, but they are generally well-tolerated. They help us assess the function of your nerves and muscles. We can discuss the details of those tests further if the initial blood work suggests they are necessary. The lab is just down the hall. You can go there at any time today. They are open until 5 PM. It should only take about 30 minutes to an hour. Results typically take 3-5 business days to come back, but I will have the lab expedite them as much as possible. I will have my nurse, Sarah, contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. I will follow up with you once we have the results. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve… put my mind at ease, a little. It's good to know that there are treatments available. And I appreciate you expediting the results. I’ll go down to the lab this afternoon. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting? Or anything like that? And… thank you again. I really appreciate your patience. It’s… hard to talk about this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. No, there's no need to fast before the blood work. Just make sure you're well-hydrated. If you have any questions or concerns at all before my nurse contacts you, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Sarah and I are here to support you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good afternoon.
