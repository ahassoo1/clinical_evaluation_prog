DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Noorduddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I work with fences, and it has been getting worse. I want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, "quickly" is relative, but we'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this. Working with fences, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Erecting fences. It is… strenuous work. Lots of lifting, bending… and lately, a lot of sharp pain. It started as just a dull ache, but now… it feels like something is stuck. Mostly in my lower back.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… It began, I believe, around the first week of July. July 7th, perhaps? I recall because the rodeo was happening that week, and I felt the first twinge while unloading some posts. It wasn’t bad then, just a little stiff. But it hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 7th. And you said it’s mostly in your lower back?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Right at the small of my back. Sometimes it goes down my left leg a little, but mostly it’s right there. And when I bend over… that is the worst. It feels like something is going to snap.
DOCTOR: Alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? I would say… a six, perhaps a seven. It is not constant, but when I move… it is sharp. I took something for it this morning, but it didn't help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six or seven. And what did you take for it, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Just… some over-the-counter pain reliever. Acetaminophen, I believe it was called. The kind my husband used to get. I do not often take anything for pain, so I cannot say if it usually works.
DOCTOR: Alright, acetaminophen. That's good to know. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: When I sit very still, it is… less bad. And when I put a warm cloth on it. But I cannot sit still all the time, Doctor. I have work to do. And the warm cloth only helps for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting still and warmth provide some relief. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Sometimes. In my left foot, mostly. It feels like… pins and needles. It comes and goes. Not all the time. It's… a strange feeling. Not painful, just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any trouble with your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Trouble…? No, Doctor. Everything works as it should. No changes there. I apologize, I am not sure I understand why you are asking about that. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important to rule out anything serious. Sometimes back pain can affect those things, so I just need to ask. Okay, so no changes with bladder or bowels. Now, have you had any back problems before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have always been strong. I worked on the ranch with my husband for years, and I have always been able to manage the physical work. This is… new. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new issue, and you haven't had any previous back problems. Now, let's get you examined. Could you please lie down on your back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. I hope this does not take too long. I have a job to finish, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just tell me if anything feels particularly painful when I press here. Hmm. And do you feel any pain when I ask you to lift your leg straight up like this?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there… right there. That is very tender. And… It hurts to lift it up straight. It pulls on my back. Not a sharp pain, but… a strong ache.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you bend forward, can you touch your toes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not anymore. I used to be able to, but now… it is too painful. I can only bend over a little bit. It feels like something is going to… give way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you stand up and walk around, do you experience any pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… better when I am standing still. But when I walk, it feels like a weight is pulling on my back. And after a few steps, the pain gets worse. It is not a constant pain, but it is there. Especially when I turn to the side.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Reihner, it appears you have a muscle strain, likely aggravated by the physical demands of your work. It's good that you haven’t experienced any issues with your bladder or bowels. However, the pain and limited range of motion suggest we need to rule out anything more serious. We’ll start with an X-ray to make sure there are no fractures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Yes, Doctor. If that is what you think is best. I just want to get this fixed, if possible. The sooner the better. I have fences to build. Will that take long? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, we can get the X-ray done right away. It shouldn’t take too long – about fifteen to twenty minutes, including the wait and the images themselves. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and inflammation. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to care for your back at home. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… acceptable. A muscle relaxant and something for the pain. I appreciate you trying to get this sorted out quickly. As for the instructions… I will listen carefully. I just need to know what I can and cannot do. Can I still work, perhaps with limitations? I have responsibilities, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. While we wait for the X-ray results, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, including lifting, bending, and twisting. It’s important to let your back rest and heal. As for work, I recommend taking at least a week off completely, if possible. If you absolutely must work, limit yourself to very light duties – perhaps some paperwork or light organizing, but absolutely no physical labor. Pushing yourself too soon could worsen the injury and delay your recovery. We will know more when we have the X-ray results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A week off… it will be difficult, but I understand. No lifting, bending, or twisting. Just light work. I will try to follow your instructions. And when will the results be back? Is it possible to call if they are available sooner? I just… I need to plan.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. The results should be back within a couple of hours. The radiology department will send them directly to my computer, and the nurse will let you know as soon as I’ve reviewed them. If they are available sooner, she will certainly contact you. In the meantime, I will print out the prescription and some instructions on back care. It includes exercises you can start after the acute pain subsides, and also information on proper lifting techniques. Now, before you head off for the X-ray, do you have any allergies or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. And… no other conditions. I am generally a healthy woman. My husband… he had some issues, but I have always been strong. Just this back pain… it is new. Thank you, Doctor. I will wait for the nurse’s call. And I will try to rest, as you advised.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. That’s good to know. Let the nurse know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you're waiting for the X-ray results. Alright, Ms. Reihner, you can go get the X-ray. The radiology department is just down the hall to the left. Let me know if you have any questions. And again, please try to rest. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I will go now. And I will try to rest. .
