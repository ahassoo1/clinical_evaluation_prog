DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need to know I am okay before I can go there. It's… a check-up, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, a check-up to make sure you’re healthy enough for the senior living facility. That’s perfectly reasonable. It sounds like they just want to be sure everything is alright before you transition. Let’s start with why you’re feeling the need for a check-up now. Have you noticed any changes in your health recently, or are you mostly doing this for the facility’s requirements?
PATIENT: Mostly for the place, I think. I feel… okay. Old, of course! But okay. My husband, he says I talk too much, but that is always. No big changes, no. Just… getting older. Is that enough for the check-up?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're feeling okay overall. And husbands often say things like that, don’t they?
PATIENT: Yes, they do! Always. But seriously, Doctor, is it okay if we just… do what they need? I don’t want to bother you with too many stories.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. We can definitely focus on what the facility requires. I can access the requirements through their system, or if you have a form from them, that would be helpful. To start, could you tell me a little bit about any major medical problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the paper! One minute… my daughter, she helped me with it. Here! I think it asks about… everything. I had… a little problem with my heart, many years ago, but the doctor fixed it. And my knees… they ache sometimes. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is perfect. "History of Present Illness…" and it looks like they've included a good section for past medical history as well. Okay, you mentioned a heart problem years ago. Do you remember what specifically was done?
PATIENT: Hmm… It was a long time ago. I was… younger, of course! I think… they put a little thing in my leg? To look at the heart? And then… medicine. Lots of medicine. I don't remember the name of the thing, Doctor. It was in a hospital, a big one. And then I was okay. Mostly okay. My regular doctor, he always knew about it. He is retired now, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a procedure involving a catheter, likely a cardiac catheterization. And medication afterwards. That's helpful. And you mentioned aching knees. How long have your knees been bothering you, and what makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees… for many years, I think. Maybe ten years? More? When I walk too much. Or when it is cold. The cold makes them very bad. And… going up stairs is hard. I try not to do stairs too much. It's just old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you might have some osteoarthritis in your knees, which is very common with age. It’s good that you’re aware of what makes it worse and try to avoid those things. Now, let's talk about any medications you’re currently taking. Do you have a list of those as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, she makes sure I have a list. Here. Just a few things. For my blood pressure, mostly. And something for… the water? I forget. She tells me what they are, but it goes in one ear and out the other! I take them every day, though, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see Lisinopril for blood pressure… and Hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, so that's the "something for the water." Good, you're keeping up with your medications, that's excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. No allergies. I eat everything! My husband, he is the picky one. He can't eat tomatoes, but I love tomatoes. No problems with allergies, no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I think. I don't remember a bad reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's quickly talk about your family history. Are there any major medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had… the sugar problem? Diabetes, yes. And my father, he had problems with his heart. He was very old, though. Very old. And… my sister, she had… something with her stomach, I think. Cancer, maybe? It was a long time ago. Lots of sickness in my family, I think. It was a big family. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of diabetes, heart disease, and possible stomach cancer in the family. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social…? Oh, you mean… do I go to parties? No, not anymore. I stay home with my husband. We watch the television. And I cook. Mostly I stay home. I used to go dancing, when I was younger, but not anymore. My knees… you know. And I don’t drink alcohol anymore. Too much for me.
DOCTOR: No, I just meant things like that - your daily routines, if you smoke or drink alcohol, what you do for exercise. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet life at home, which is lovely. And no smoking or alcohol, that's excellent. Alright, Lindra, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do. I hope it is not too much trouble. I am an old lady, you know!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lindra. It’s a very simple exam. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, though I do hear a slight murmur - it's likely nothing to be concerned about given your history, but we'll make a note of it. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Now, let me just take a look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat looks fine. Now, just let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, let's just feel your abdomen. No tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal there. Alright, Lindra, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally well. I’m going to take a look at the requirements from the facility now to see if we need to order any specific blood tests or imaging. One moment.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I hope I did not bother you too much. I always worry about taking up too much time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lindra. You’re not bothering me in the slightest. That's what I'm here for. Okay, it looks like the facility is requesting a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a chest x-ray. These are fairly standard tests. The CBC will check for any signs of infection or anemia. The metabolic panel will check your kidney function and electrolytes. The lipid panel will check your cholesterol levels. And the chest x-ray will make sure your lungs are clear. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… okay. Whatever they need. I trust you. You seem to know what you are doing. Is it very expensive? I have… insurance, but sometimes it doesn't cover everything. My husband worries about the money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Let me check the estimated costs with your insurance information. Okay, it looks like with your private insurance, your out-of-pocket cost for these tests should be around $150, depending on any deductibles you may have. The chest x-ray is the most expensive part. I'll also submit a pre-authorization request to your insurance company to ensure coverage. We can also discuss payment options if that’s a concern. But right now, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. Would you prefer to do them here at the clinic, or would you rather go to an outside lab?
PATIENT: Here, Doctor. Here at the clinic would be much better. I don't like going to new places. I get… lost easily. And it's easier to trust people here. When can we do them? I don't want to wait too long. I want to get into the place before it gets too cold!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. We can definitely do them here. Let me see… We have an opening tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow at 9:00? Yes, that is perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Let me write that down… 9:00 AM tomorrow. Okay. Is there anything else I need to do? Fasting or… anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the blood tests, you'll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. So, you would need to stop eating after 9:00 PM tonight. And please bring a list of any medications you’re currently taking, just in case. Do you have that with you now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have it. Here it is. Just like before. Lisinopril and… the water pill. That’s all. And I will remember not to eat after 9:00 tonight. No problem. Thank you for reminding me. I think that is everything, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think that’s everything. So, to recap, you have an appointment tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM for a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, lipid panel, and chest x-ray. You'll need to fast after 9:00 PM tonight, and please bring your list of medications. After the tests, we'll review the results and send them to the facility. Do you have any questions for me at all before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you explained everything very clearly. You are very patient with me. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better now. It's good to know everything is being taken care of. I can go home now and rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. I'm glad I could help. And you're absolutely right, rest is important. If you have any questions or concerns at all before tomorrow, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a pamphlet with our contact information. Alright, you can head home and relax now. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning. Have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: .
