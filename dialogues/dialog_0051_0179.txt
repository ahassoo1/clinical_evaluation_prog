DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. GLAZEWSKI. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… difficult to explain. Words… they don’t come so easy now. I have trouble… finding them. It’s been… a little while, but it feels worse lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your speech – trouble finding the right words, and it’s been progressing recently. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is… quite right. Progressing… yes. It’s not like… a complete loss, you understand. I know what I want to say… the thought is there. But the word… it feels… far away. It’s… frustrating, sometimes. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Frustrating and worrying – I can certainly understand that. It sounds like it’s impacting your ability to communicate, which is very important. Can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That is… a difficult question. It wasn’t… sudden, you see. More like… a slow fading. Maybe… six months ago? Or perhaps a little longer? I… I am not certain. My wife… she noticed it first, I think. Before… before she passed. It’s all a bit… hazy now.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be incredibly difficult. It sounds like this difficulty with your speech started gradually, about six months ago, and your wife was the first to notice it. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… still hard, yes. And… constant is… not quite right. Some days it’s… better. Easier to speak. Other days… like today… it’s more difficult. It’s… worse when I am tired, I think. And if I try to… hurry. When I am relaxed… it’s a little easier. But it’s always… there, in the back of my mind. A worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's constant in that it's always present, but the severity fluctuates. Worse with fatigue and when rushed, better when relaxed. That's helpful to know. Now, beyond the difficulty finding words, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me see. I… I don’t think so. No… trouble with… understanding, you understand. I can still… read, and watch television. My hearing is… not as good as it used to be, but that’s just… age, I think. No… I don’t believe so. Nothing else… comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no difficulty understanding speech, reading, or watching TV. Just the difficulty finding the words you want to say. And you've noticed some age-related hearing loss. Have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No weakness… or numbness. My legs… they ache sometimes, when I walk too far, but that’s… just the arthritis, I think. The doctor… the one before… he said it was just age. No… nothing like weakness or numbness. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is always good to ask, Mr. Gyamfi. We just want to rule things out. Arthritis is a reasonable explanation for the leg aches. Now, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Well, I had… the arthritis, as I said. And… high blood pressure, for a time. But they… gave me pills, and it’s been… controlled for many years now. My wife… she kept track of all the details. I’m… not very good with remembering these things. I had… a surgery, many years ago. On my… knee, I think. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing else… comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, high blood pressure which is well-controlled with medication, and a past knee surgery. I'm going to check your electronic health record to get more specifics about those details. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I’ve never… reacted to anything. My wife… she always checked the labels for me. She was… very careful. No… I believe I have no allergies. Nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Let me pull up your records here… Okay, I see you were diagnosed with osteoarthritis about 15 years ago, and hypertension, which has been managed with Lisinopril for the last 10 years. You did have a total knee replacement on your right knee in 2005. And no documented allergies. That matches what you told me. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Medications… besides the Lisinopril… hmm. Let me think… I take… something for the arthritis, sometimes. When it’s… bad. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? Over the counter. And… a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. For my bones. That’s all I can think of, Doctor. Just the Ibuprofen and the Vitamin D.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis pain, and Vitamin D supplement. Good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Well… I am… widowed, as I said. My wife… passed away about a year ago. I live… alone, in a small house in town. I… don’t have much family nearby. I used to… enjoy gardening, but it’s… hard now, with my knees. I mostly… stay at home, read the newspaper, watch television. Not a very… exciting life, I’m afraid. But it’s… quiet.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been through a lot, Mr. Gyamfi, and it's perfectly alright if your life is quiet right now. It's important to take care of yourself. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I never… smoked. My wife… she didn’t approve. And… I never felt the need. No, never smoked. And no… drinking, either. Not really.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that is… alright. Whatever you think is… best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please… just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look in your ears and throat. I'll also check your reflexes and strength, and do a basic neurological assessment. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now let’s take a look in your ears… Good, they look clear as well. And your throat looks fine. Now, could you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes… I can see it. Is that… alright? Is it… blurry? I haven't had my eyes checked in a while.
DOCTOR: No, your vision seems fine for this exam. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm. Good. And now the other arm… Okay, reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that… enough? It’s been a while since I’ve done anything… strenuous.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Gyamfi. Strength is normal in both hands. Finally, I’m going to do a quick assessment of your speech. I’m going to ask you to repeat a few simple phrases. Can you say "No ifs, ands, or buts"?
PATIENT: No… ifs… ands… or… buts. Was that… alright? It feels… a little harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Gyamfi. And now, can you please count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: One hundred… ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… seventy-two… sixty-five… Sixty-eight…? No… wait… sixty… what was it again? It’s… slipping my mind. I’m… sorry. It’s… harder than I thought.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Gyamfi. No need to apologize. That was very helpful. Okay, based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with word finding and some mild cognitive slowing. This could be related to a number of things, and it's important to investigate further. I'd like to order a few tests, including a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level to rule out any underlying medical causes. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at the structures and rule out any structural abnormalities. Do that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests…? An MRI…? Yes… yes, I suppose so. Whatever you think is… best. It’s… a bit frightening, but I want to… know what’s going on. I just… want to understand. And… I want to be able to… remember things again. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests, but it’s important to get to the bottom of this. And while I can't make any promises, many of the causes of cognitive slowing are treatable or manageable. Even if we can’t reverse everything, we can certainly work to slow down the progression and help you maintain your quality of life. I'll write up the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now. The blood tests can be done at the lab across the street. For the MRI, we'll need to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a week or two to get one. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A month… yes, that sounds… alright. A plan… yes, I like that. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I… I feel a little better now, knowing that… something is being done. Just… please let me know if there’s… anything I can do to help. Anything at all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. That’s what I’m here for. For now, just focus on taking care of yourself. Stay hydrated, get plenty of rest, and try to keep your mind active. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch to schedule the MRI and follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Gyamfi. And please, don’t worry too much. We’ll figure this out together.
PATIENT: Nice meeting you too, Doctor. And… thank you again. I… I appreciate your help. I… I’ll be in touch. .
