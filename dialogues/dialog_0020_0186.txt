DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I’m trying out for a team. Need to get a checkup for that, I guess. Don't want to fall apart on ‘em, you know? It’s a… a volleyball team.
DOCTOR: Volleyball – that’s great! A physical for a sports team, absolutely. That’s a very responsible thing to do. It’s good you're thinking ahead. To start, can you tell me a little more about the team?
PATIENT: It's… a local thing. Just a bunch of guys getting together, mostly. Over-30s league. I haven't played in a while, though, so figured I should probably see if anything’s gonna give out. It's mostly just for fun, really. Not aiming for the Olympics or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Even for fun, it's wise to get checked out, especially after a break. Alright, Mr. Kingan, to get a better picture of things, I'll need to ask a few questions. It might seem like a lot, but it helps me make sure you’re safe to play. First, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. A little creaky in the mornings, you know? Old age. But no pain, pain. Just…stiffness. Mostly in my knees and back. Nothing I haven’t gotten used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the knees and back. And how long have you been noticing this stiffness, Mr. Kingan?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a while. Years, probably. Comes and goes. Worse in the winter, I think. I haven’t paid it much mind, honestly. It’s just…what happens when you get older, right?
DOCTOR: That’s fair. It is common with age. Still, it’s good we’re talking about it. Have you noticed anything else along with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Sometimes my knees feel a little… weak? Like they might buckle. But that doesn’t happen often. Mostly when I’m tired, I think. I haven't fallen or anything, don't worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in the knees, especially when tired. Good to know you haven’t fallen. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, actually. Never been sick much. Had the usual colds and stuff, but that's about it. Always been pretty active, even when I wasn’t playing volleyball. Hiking, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had to go under the knife. Knock on wood. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible, honestly. Unless I absolutely have to go.
DOCTOR: I understand that sentiment. Alright, how about medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not taking anything regularly. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Really, I try to just…tough it out. Old habits, I guess. Don’t like relying on pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Bees, maybe? But that was when I was a kid, and it wasn't that bad. Just a little swelling. I don’t really worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah. Quit smoking years ago. Drink a beer now and then with friends, but not much. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I like being… clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan, that’s a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to… well, planning to play volleyball. I'm probably in worse shape than I think, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees and back. If you could step on the scale for me, please. Okay, 183 centimeters and 129 pounds. That gives us a BMI of… …23.1. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything alright? Sounds kinda weird when you listen to it, doesn’t it? I don’t usually pay attention to all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear anything concerning. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to tap your knees with this little hammer. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern at your age. Now, let’s take a look at your knees and back. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. This is kinda like when I was a kid, getting checked up for school sports. Except I think I’m a lot more creaky now. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your knees have some mild tenderness on the inner side of both joints, and the range of motion is slightly limited. Your lower back feels a bit tight, but I don't detect any acute muscle spasm. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. When you press there… on the inside of my knees. Not bad, just… a dull ache. And my back feels kinda stiff, like I said. It’s just always a little tight. It’s worse in the morning, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Thanks for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and some age-related stiffness in your lower back. The tenderness and limited range of motion in your knees, combined with the stiffness, are consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, osteoarthritis is a common condition, especially as we get older. It's caused by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It’s not something to be overly alarmed about, but it does require some management. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Osteo… what-itis? Sounds serious. Is that gonna stop me from playing volleyball? That’s what I’m worried about, honestly. I don’t want to pull a muscle or something and make a fool of myself. Is it something I need to get surgery for? I really don't want surgery.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a fancy way of saying the cartilage in your joints is wearing down a bit, which is common with age and activity. It’s usually not something that needs surgery, especially in the early stages. The good news is that it's often manageable with conservative treatments. Surgery is typically only considered if other methods haven't provided relief, and it's not something we’re discussing at all right now. As for playing volleyball, it depends on how you manage it. We can explore some options to help you stay active and minimize your risk of injury. We'll focus on strengthening the muscles around your knees and back, improving your flexibility, and using proper warm-up techniques. Would you be open to trying some physical therapy exercises?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? Like, going somewhere and having someone make me do… stretches? I'm not really a big fan of exercises, to be honest. I mean, I'll try it, I guess. But if it’s too much, I’m not promising anything. I'm just trying to have some fun, you know? Is there anything else I can do? Like, maybe a cream or something?
DOCTOR: I understand. Physical therapy can be helpful, but it's not a one-size-fits-all approach. We can start with some simple exercises you can do at home, and if you feel comfortable, we can explore more intensive therapy later. And yes, there are other options. We can try a topical cream, like a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed. These can help with pain and inflammation. I also recommend using proper footwear with good support, warming up before playing, and cooling down afterward. Listen to your body and don’t push yourself too hard. I can write you a prescription for a topical cream and a list of some simple exercises. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A cream sounds a lot easier than going somewhere and getting… poked and prodded. And I can probably handle some simple exercises. As long as they're not too complicated. I'm not very flexible, you know. Okay, a cream and some easy exercises. That sounds like a plan. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kingan. Here’s the prescription for the cream. You can fill it at your local pharmacy. And here’s the handout with the exercises. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you feel comfortable. I also recommend a multivitamin to support overall joint health. I’d like to see you back in about a month to see how you’re doing. If you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. A month, right. Okay. Thanks again, Doctor Beinborn. You've been a big help. I appreciate you not telling me I can't play volleyball. I guess I’ll go get this cream and try not to pull a muscle.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. That's my job! And remember, listen to your body and don’t push yourself too hard. Enjoy your volleyball, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day!
