DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s rather straightforward, isn’t it? I want to… have a baby. And I want to make absolutely certain there won’t be any… problems. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve read enough articles to know things become…difficult. So, let’s just get right to it, shall we? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're wanting to explore options for getting pregnant and want to assess if there might be any obstacles, especially considering your age. That's very proactive of you. First, let’s get a bit of your medical history. Have you been trying for a while, or is this just the beginning of the process?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not trying. I'm planning. There’s a difference, you see. And frankly, I haven't even begun to consider… that part yet. I want to know what could go wrong, so I can avoid it. It's preventative. Honestly, the whole idea of waiting and then finding out things are difficult is… barbaric. I'm 51. I need a realistic assessment, not a lecture on timing.
DOCTOR: Right, preventative. I completely understand wanting to be prepared. Okay. So, to get a realistic assessment, let's start with your general health. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been. I eat well – mostly. I walk, though this heat… it’s dreadful. And I certainly don’t have… diabetes. My ex-husband, now he had problems. High cholesterol, terrible diet. A disaster. But I take care of myself. Medicare checks me up regularly, and they haven’t mentioned anything concerning. Though, I suppose they miss things. They're always so busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Medicare check-ups are helpful, but it's good we're doing this as well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. A fairly standard procedure, I believe. And I broke my wrist, skiing, years ago. But that’s it. Nothing major. No… complicated births, nothing like that. I’ve never even been pregnant, which is the whole point of this consultation, isn’t it? Honestly, I’m starting to feel as though I’m giving you my entire life story.
DOCTOR: You're not at all, Angelle, this is helpful information. And no complicated births is good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or anything affecting fertility?
PATIENT: Fertility? Goodness. That's… a delicate subject. My mother… well, she had trouble getting pregnant with my brother. Took years, I believe. And my aunt… on my father’s side… she had several miscarriages. Very sad. Heart disease, yes. My grandfather on my mother’s side. A very strong man, but it got him in the end. Cancer… a few cousins, nothing too close. Honestly, the whole family is a bit of a mess. Always something. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have that family history, Angelle, and I understand if it's difficult to talk about. Knowing these things can help us understand potential risks. Okay. Now, just a couple of quick questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer to… treat things naturally when possible. A bit of ginger for nausea, maybe. And vitamin C during the winter. But no prescriptions. I don’t believe in filling my body with… chemicals. Honestly, most doctors just want to hand out pills. It's a dreadful practice.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. I eat everything. Well, I don't particularly enjoy beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Honestly, I’m quite robust. It's rather remarkable, actually. People always comment on my health. I suspect it's my genes. And a sensible lifestyle, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Angelle. No known allergies. Okay. So, given your age and wanting to explore pregnancy, we should do a few baseline tests to assess your overall health and reproductive function. We’ll want to check your blood pressure, weight, and do a blood test to check hormone levels, thyroid function, and a complete metabolic panel. We'll also need a urine sample. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Something practical. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. The sooner we get this done, the better. Honestly, I'm wasting my entire afternoon here discussing my family history and beet preferences. Just tell me where to go, and let’s get it over with. And please, make it quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. My nurse, Sarah, will take you to the lab to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn’t take too long. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Sarah will explain everything. Do you have any questions before I let her in?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… make sure they’re gentle with the needle. I don’t faint, but I do dislike needles. And tell Sarah I’m rather busy, so efficiency is appreciated. Honestly, I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll let Sarah know. She's very efficient. I’ll have her come in right away.
PATIENT: Good. That’s all I ask. Efficiency. Honestly, it shouldn’t be difficult.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll get everything sorted quickly.
