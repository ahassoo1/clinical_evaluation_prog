DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, or a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’m not sure where to even begin, really.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. I understand. It’s good you’re recognizing that something isn’t quite right. That's often the hardest part. Hmm… let’s try to unpack that a bit. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, not at all. I suppose…over the last year, things have just gradually…diminished. My energy, mostly. And I haven’t been sleeping well. It’s hard to pinpoint an exact moment, though. It’s just…a general feeling of being worn down, if that makes any sense?
DOCTOR: Gradually over the last year… diminished energy, trouble sleeping. Yes, that makes sense. It sounds… frustrating. Okay. And can you tell me a bit more about this energy level?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. I work with my hands, Doctor. Molders, shapers, casters – it’s physical work. I used to be able to go all day, no problem. Now… I find myself needing to sit down frequently. And even then, it’s not a restful sit. I’m just…tired. It’s affecting my work, honestly. It’s always been my pride, being able to create things, and lately… it feels like a struggle.
DOCTOR: That is a struggle, especially when it impacts something you take pride in. So, fatigue that’s interfering with your work. And how about other aspects of your life?
PATIENT: Well, my husband, Ricardo, and I used to enjoy dancing. Salsa, mostly. We’d go out a couple of times a month. But I just haven’t had the…oomph, for lack of a better word. I’m less patient, too. Small things bother me more than they should. I’m not myself, Doctor. I don’t enjoy things as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Less enjoyment, increased irritability… okay. We're building a picture here. Now, let's talk about sleep. You mentioned trouble sleeping. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, usually. It’s… staying asleep. I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes it’s a noise, sometimes just…nothing. And then I lie there, thinking. Worrying. It’s hard to get back to sleep after that. And when I do finally wake up in the morning, I don’t feel rested at all. It’s like I haven’t slept a wink.
DOCTOR: Interrupted sleep, waking unrefreshed… alright. Now, just to get a broader sense of things, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite hasn't been great. Not much of an appetite, really. I’ve lost a little weight, but nothing drastic. And… oh! I’ve been feeling rather cold, even when Ricardo thinks the temperature is perfectly comfortable. I often have to wear a sweater, even during the day. It's a bit odd, honestly.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite, some weight loss, feeling cold… okay. And are you experiencing any aches or pains?
PATIENT: Not really… constant pain, no. But sometimes my muscles feel… weak, achy. Especially in my shoulders and back. It’s not severe, but it’s noticeable. And it’s worse when I’ve been working. It just feels like they’re… tired muscles, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, just… exhaustion, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, I… I hadn’t really thought about it. Let me see… No, not really. Everything seems… normal in that regard, if you don’t mind me being blunt. I apologize, it's not a very elegant topic. But no, no changes there.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Pitzel. It’s important information, and you’re doing fine. Now, just a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing major, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox. And I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was well-controlled with medication for a while, and the doctor eventually took me off it. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, honestly. Ricardo always handles those things, but…well, he encouraged me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses, history of blood pressure, not seen a doctor recently. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I've always been fairly healthy, up until recently. I've been lucky, I suppose. Just a few minor injuries over the years, nothing that required surgery. A sprained ankle, a broken wrist once when I was a child... but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No surgeries… alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... Well, my mother had some trouble with her arthritis, quite severe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when he was in his late seventies. It was… sudden. He hadn’t been feeling well for a while, but we didn’t realize how serious it was.
DOCTOR: History of arthritis in mother, heart problems in father… alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said, I came off the blood pressure medication years ago, and I haven’t been taking anything else regularly. Just an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing consistent. I try to avoid medication whenever possible, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing a number of symptoms – fatigue, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, feeling cold, muscle aches… Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgment. I want to figure out what’s going on, and I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I'll listen to your lungs and do a quick check of your thyroid. After that, we’ll check your reflexes and a few other basic things. It shouldn't take too long.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. It feels good to finally be addressing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 108 over 65. Not dramatically low, but something to keep in mind. Heart rate is 68, regular. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but no obvious nodules. A little tenderness to palpation. Reflexes are a little sluggish, but within normal limits. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, but the enlarged thyroid and sluggish reflexes are a little concerning. I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel – to check your thyroid hormone levels – and a vitamin D level. It will also be useful to check your iron and B12. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Not to medications, not to anything, as far as I know. I’ve never had any reactions. And thank you for explaining everything. It’s helpful to understand what you’re looking for. So, blood tests… that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The nurse will be in shortly to draw that for you. While we wait for the results, it's important to be aware that these symptoms could be due to a number of things - vitamin deficiency, thyroid issue, even something like early menopause. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s important to rule things out. We’ll get the tests back in a few days, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. Is there anything I can answer for you at the moment?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Menopause… I hadn’t even considered that. No, I suppose not at the moment, Doctor. I trust your judgment, and I understand you need the test results before you can make a diagnosis. It’s just… a little overwhelming, to be honest. But thank you for being thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Ms. Pitzel, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be right in, and I’ll be sure to review the results with you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. If you experience any new symptoms or if your existing symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office.
PATIENT: .
