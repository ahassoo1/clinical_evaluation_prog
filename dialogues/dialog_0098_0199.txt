DOCTOR: Good morning, Marquie. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you too. Honestly, it’s kinda hard to explain. I’ve just been… really short of breath lately. Like, I get winded walking up the stairs, or even just doing stuff around the house. It’s been happening for… a little while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of dates well, sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize about the dates, Marquie. A “little while” is fine to start with. Can you tell me approximately how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that's the hard part. Maybe… a couple of months? It started slowly, I think. I just figured I was getting out of shape, you know? Working long hours at the plant. It’s… water treatment. A lot of walking around checking things. But it's gotten worse. Like, noticeably worse in the last few weeks, I’d say. Sorry I can’t be more precise. It all kinda… blends together.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Marquie. We'll figure it out. So, it started gradually and has worsened over the last few weeks. Aside from the shortness of breath, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife, Elena, she’s been saying I cough a lot, especially at night. I don't really notice it myself, to be honest. I sleep pretty soundly. Also, I’ve been feeling… tired, I guess. More tired than usual. It's hard to say if that’s just from work or… something else. Oh! And sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, exactly, just… constricted. Does that make sense? I don’t know medical terms, sorry.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Marquie. Coughing, especially at night, fatigue, and chest tightness… those are all things we need to explore. You mentioned your wife has noticed the cough – is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh, good question. I think… it’s kinda both? Sometimes it’s dry, a tickly cough. Other times… yeah, I bring up a little something. It’s… clear, mostly. Not a lot, though. Definitely not like… a bad cough, if that makes sense. Elena says it seems worse when I'm lying down, like it bothers me more then. She worries a lot, she's a good wife. I just try to brush it off. Don't want to scare her, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that Elena is paying attention, and it’s very thoughtful of you to be mindful of her worries. A cough that worsens when lying down is helpful information. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't think so. I haven't taken my temperature or anything. I just… don't usually get sick. Chills… maybe a little bit sometimes, but honestly, it gets kinda cold here at night. And night sweats… no, not really. I usually sleep pretty warm. I mean, I wake up sweating sometimes, but that’s just because the blankets are too heavy. Sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful. It’s all kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Marquie. It's okay if it's blurry; we'll piece it together. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history… okay. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I mean, I've had the usual colds and flus, but nothing serious. I haven’t really been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. Not since… well, before I came here. We didn’t have much access to good healthcare back home. And now… well, we don't have insurance. It’s complicated. Sorry. I guess I just try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marquie. That’s good to know. Past medical history is limited, that’s alright. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, not that I remember. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that just needed a cast. Nothing… major. I've never been under anesthesia or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m usually pretty healthy. That’s why this is so worrying. I don't get sick easily. Maybe it’s just… a bad cold? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Marquie. It's important to investigate these things, even if you're typically healthy. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had lung problems like asthma, COPD, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… okay. This is hard. I haven’t seen my family in… a long time. Venezuela, you know? Things are… complicated there. My mother, she had… some breathing problems when she was older, I think. But I don’t really know what it was. Just… old age, maybe? And my grandfather, he smoked a lot. He died when I was young. I don’t know if it was his lungs or something else. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have a lot of information. We didn’t talk about these things much. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Marquie. It's understandable that you don't have much information. We'll work with what we have. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she doesn’t either. We both try to stay healthy, you know? We walk a lot, eat good food when we can. We… try. It’s just… hard sometimes. Working at the plant, long hours… not a lot of time for everything. Sorry, I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Marquie. That’s good to know about the smoking. Now, do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I don’t drink, and definitely no drugs. I… I don’t really have the time or the interest. I work long hours at the plant, and when I'm not working, I just want to spend time with my wife. We’re pretty simple people. Honestly, I’m more worried about getting back to work. We need the money. But I can’t keep coughing and getting winded, you know? It's not fair to my coworkers. Sorry. Am I being annoying? I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: You're not being annoying at all, Marquie. It’s good to know about that. Now, one last question about your history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve taken over-the-counter cold medicine before, but nothing serious. No food allergies, no pollen allergies… I think I’m pretty lucky in that department. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what’s going on. I just feel… tired and short of breath. Is that enough to worry about? I don’t want to waste your time. I should probably just get back to work. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You are not wasting my time, Marquie. It’s good to know about the allergies. And your symptoms are worth investigating. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’ll check your oxygen levels. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s… okay. Sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I’m worried about getting back to work. And Elena… she worries about me being gone for too long. Sorry. Just… let me know if you need anything. I'll try to hold still.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. Just breathe normally. Okay. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, particularly on the left side. It’s not severe, but it’s definitely present. Your heart sounds regular, but your heart rate is slightly elevated. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range, but on the lower end. Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of bronchitis or possibly asthma. The wheezing suggests there’s some inflammation in your airways. However, given your history, we should also consider other possibilities, and it would be helpful to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Ugh, bronchitis… or asthma? Is that… bad? I mean, I’ve never been sick like this before. I don’t want to need… inhalers or anything like that. I just want to feel normal again. And getting back to work… is that even possible? Sorry. Am I being too dramatic? I just… worry a lot. About everything. And Elena… she’s already worried enough.
DOCTOR: You’re not being dramatic at all, Marquie. It's perfectly normal to be worried when you're not feeling well. Neither bronchitis nor asthma are necessarily severe, but it’s important to get them properly diagnosed and treated. To help determine the cause, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a spirometry test. The X-ray will allow us to see if there's any evidence of infection or inflammation in your lungs. The spirometry test will measure how much air you can breathe in and out, which can help us assess your lung function. I also want to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection. Do you have any concerns about getting these tests done?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests… okay. I guess. Chest X-ray… spirometry… blood work… It sounds… expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know? I’m worried about the cost. We just… don’t have a lot of money. I don’t want to burden the clinic. Sorry. I should probably just try to rest. Maybe it’ll go away on its own. I don’t want to cause any trouble. And getting back to work… it's important. I need to earn a living. Sorry. Am I being unreasonable? I just… worry a lot. About everything. And Elena… she worries too.
DOCTOR: Marquie, you are not being unreasonable at all. It’s completely understandable to be concerned about the cost of these tests, especially without insurance. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to help you get the care you need. This clinic has a financial assistance program for patients who are uninsured or have limited income. We can explore that option for you, and we may be able to reduce the cost of the tests or offer payment plans. I also want to emphasize that getting a proper diagnosis is important, even if it means spending some money upfront. It’s better to know what’s going on and get the right treatment, rather than letting it potentially worsen and become more expensive down the road. Would you like me to connect you with our financial counselor so we can discuss your options?
PATIENT: Ugh… a financial counselor? That sounds… helpful, I guess. I mean, I don't want to be a burden, but I also don't want to get sicker. And Elena… she worries enough as it is. So, yeah… okay. Connecting me with a financial counselor… that sounds good. But please… don’t go to a lot of trouble. I don’t want to cause any problems. Sorry. I just… worry a lot. About everything. And work… I need to get back to work. It's important. Sorry. I just… I don't know what to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marquie. It’s no trouble at all. I'm happy to help. Let me just get the financial counselor on the phone. Her name is Maria, and she's very good at helping patients navigate these types of situations. Hello, Maria?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Thank you, Doctor. That's… really kind of you. I just… I'm worried. About everything. And work… I need to get back to work soon. I just hope… it's nothing serious. And Elena… she's a good wife. She worries a lot. So, yeah. Just… please let me know if you need anything. I'll try to be patient. Sorry. I just… worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Marquie, you’re not a burden at all. It’s my job to help you, and I'm glad you came in today. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll work together to find a solution. Maria has agreed to speak with you directly after your appointment to discuss the financial assistance program. She'll explain all your options and help you determine what's best for your situation. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a temporary note excusing you from work for a few days. That way, you can focus on getting these tests done without worrying about your job. I also want you to try to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Avoid smoking or being around smoke, and if you have any fever or worsening symptoms, please call the clinic immediately. Here you are. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take care of everything, one step at a time. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Thank you, Doctor. The note… that’s helpful. Elena will be happy to hear that. And the financial assistance… that’s really kind of you. I don't know what we’d do without that. Honestly, I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… please let me know if there’s anything else I need to do. And thank you… for everything. You’ve been very kind. I just… worry a lot. About everything. And work… I need to get back to work soon. Sorry. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Maria will be contacting you shortly to schedule a meeting. And please, focus on taking care of yourself and getting some rest. I wish you all the best, Marquie. And please, give Elena my best as well. .
