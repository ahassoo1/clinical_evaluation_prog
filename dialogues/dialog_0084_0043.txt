DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it's this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been bothering me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, maybe a little longer. It’s not the worst pain, but it’s there, always.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. A headache at the back of your head for about a week… and you say it's constant?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, yeah. Not like a throbbing thing, more of a… a pressure, almost. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. It doesn’t knock me off my feet or anything, I can still do things, but it's definitely noticeable. Especially when I’m thinking hard, or if I get a little stressed. You ever get those?
DOCTOR: I do, Percell. Many people do. Has anything changed recently that might be contributing to it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… Not really, not that I can recall. My routine’s pretty much the same. I still get up, work with my clients, eat my meals… Oh! My daughter, May, she moved back home with her little one about two weeks ago. That’s been… nice, busy, a good kind of busy, but maybe a little more going on. Could that be it? I haven't been sleeping as much, I guess. Just enjoying having them around.
DOCTOR: That could certainly contribute, Percell. Changes in routine, even good ones, can sometimes cause headaches. And less sleep definitely doesn’t help. Now, on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this headache, on an average day?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good way to put it. Hmm… I’d say a four, maybe a five on bad days. It's rarely a ten, thankfully. Like I said, it’s more annoying than debilitating. I can still work, still cook, still… well, still be. But it’s always there in the background, you know? It doesn’t really go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four to five. And it's constant, with no real relief. Have you tried anything to treat it already?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’ve taken some of those over-the-counter pain relievers… you know, ibuprofen, that sort of thing. Doesn’t really do much, to be honest. Takes the edge off for a little while, maybe, but it comes right back. I don't like taking a lot of pills, so I haven't pushed it. I figured I should probably come see someone before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it's been going on for about a week or a little longer?
PATIENT: Closer to two weeks now, I think. Time gets away from me, you know? Started gradually, just a little ache, and then it just… stayed. Didn't really get worse quickly, just… persistent. I was hoping it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t. That’s why I’m here today. I don't want it to become a bigger problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, no blurry vision. No fever or anything like that. I haven't felt nauseous, and no trouble speaking. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from having the little one around – keeping up with her! She's a bundle of energy. No numbness or tingling anywhere, either. Just the headache, and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other neurological symptoms, just the headache and increased fatigue. Do you have any history of headaches like this before?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve gotten the occasional headache over the years, like anyone does, but nothing that lasted this long, or felt like this. Usually it’s just a quick thing, and some rest takes care of it. This is different. It's… more stubborn, I guess. Never needed to see a doctor for a headache before this, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a full picture, Percell, do you have any significant medical problems – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my doctor always tells me my blood pressure’s a little high, but it’s never been too bad. I try to watch my salt intake. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was years and years ago and hasn’t bothered me since. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for an old man, I think! I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, but otherwise healthy. Gallbladder removed many years ago. Do you take any medications regularly, Percell?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, a very small dose. Doctor says it’s good to keep it in check, even though it's not terribly high. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, especially in the winter. That's about it. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking a lot of pills, like I said earlier. Makes me feel sluggish, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife used to keep track of all that, but… well, that was a long time ago. I haven't had to worry about allergies in years. I don’t have any trouble with food allergies either, for that matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam, Percell, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Here I am, Doctor. Old bones aren't what they used to be. Go ahead, take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 85. Your pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are normal. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon for someone your age. Now, I'm going to feel around your head and neck to check for any tenderness. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit right here, at the very back of my head. That's where the headache is, so it makes sense. Not painful painful, just… sensitive. And maybe a little bit on this side of my neck, but it’s hard to say. It could just be muscle tension, I suppose. I do spend a lot of time at my desk, working with my clients.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness at the base of the skull and along the neck muscles. Now I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you turn your head to the left and look at your hand?
PATIENT: There we go… a little stiff, but I can do it. Not a lot of pain, just… resistance. It doesn't feel like it's locking up or anything. It's probably just age, Doctor. Everything creaks a little more these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, some limited range of motion. Now to the right?
PATIENT: Same thing, Doctor. A little stiff, a little resistance. Not bad, but definitely not as smooth as it used to be. I don’t think I’m going to be winning any head-turning contests anytime soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you shrug your shoulders for me?
PATIENT: Yep, can do that. Feels a little tight, though. I get a lot of tension in my shoulders, especially when I’m stressed. I’m a financial advisor, Doctor, so… well, you can imagine. People worry about their money, and I worry with them. It adds up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And one last thing. Can you clench your fists and flex your wrists for me?
PATIENT: Yep, can do that too. A little weak, maybe, but nothing serious. I haven't been doing much heavy lifting lately, to be honest. Mostly just paperwork and phone calls. It feels… a little stiff, but I don’t think I’ve lost my grip completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Percell. Thank you. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to stress and muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The limited range of motion and tenderness support that. Given your age and lack of other neurological symptoms, I'm not overly concerned about anything serious. However, we should rule out a few things. I’d like to order some bloodwork – just a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count – to make sure there's nothing else going on. Also, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, it would be good to get a better reading over a few days. Do you have a way to monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. Bloodwork is fine, I don’t mind that at all. And no, I don't have a blood pressure monitor at home. My doctor checks it when I go in for my yearly checkup, but I don't have one to use myself. Maybe I should get one, though, if you think it would be good. I’d be happy to do that. So, just the bloodwork for now, and then maybe look into getting a monitor? Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I can do to help with the tension?
DOCTOR: Yes, just the bloodwork for now, and a home blood pressure monitor would be good. And for the tension, I’d recommend trying some simple things. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help, but you've already said those don't work very well for you. Heat or cold packs on your neck and shoulders can sometimes provide relief. Gentle stretching exercises can also help loosen up those muscles. And try to manage your stress levels – easier said than done, I know, but even taking a few minutes each day to relax – deep breathing, meditation, or just doing something you enjoy – can make a difference. I can give you a handout with some stretching exercises and relaxation techniques. We can also talk about referral to physical therapy if the symptoms don't improve. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor, thank you. A handout would be great, definitely. Stretching exercises sound like a good idea, I just need to remember to actually do them. And I'll look into getting a blood pressure monitor. Physical therapy sounds a little… intense, but I'm glad to know it's an option if I need it. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just need to get the bloodwork ordered, and I’ll start working on the stretching and relaxation. How does that work, getting the bloodwork done? Do I need an appointment somewhere?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll write you a requisition for the bloodwork. You can take that to the lab at the clinic across the street. They take walk-ins, so you don’t need an appointment. They'll draw the blood, and the results should be back in a few days. I'll have the nurse call you with the results once they are available. In the meantime, try those stretches and relaxation techniques, and let's see how you feel. If your headache worsens significantly, or you develop any new symptoms – like fever, vision changes, or weakness – please call the office right away. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll get the bloodwork done tomorrow and start working on those stretches. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the requisition. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
