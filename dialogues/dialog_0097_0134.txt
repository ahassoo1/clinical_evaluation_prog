DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Land, things have been a bit off, that’s for sure. I mostly just…don’t feel right. It's hard to explain. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t even get very hungry anymore. A few bites and I feel full. It's been going on for…well, a while now, I reckon. I saw another doctor before, and they said…something about cancer. I don't rightly recall all the details, my memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning, Raymonde. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything – we'll take our time and figure things out. You said “something about cancer” – do you recall where the other doctor thought this might be?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that you mention it… I think it was…somewhere in my belly? Lower down, mostly. But honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. They did a lot of tests, poked and prodded…it was a stressful time. I was mostly just trying to keep my animals calm while I was going back and forth to appointments. I train 'em, you see. Mostly dogs, but I've worked with all sorts over the years. It helps keep me busy, at least. But this feeling…this nausea and not being hungry…it's making it harder to do even that.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Raymonde. It’s good you’re keeping busy with your dogs – that's wonderful. And completely understandable that it’s hard to recall details with everything going on. Let's see if we can get a clearer picture. You mentioned nausea and loss of appetite. Are you experiencing any pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Well, not exactly pain, Doctor. More like…discomfort. A sort of heavy feeling, sometimes. It’s not sharp, or anything. Just…uncomfortable. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. And it comes and goes, really. Some days it's worse than others. I try to ignore it, mostly. I've always been a tough old bird, you see. But this…this is wearing me down. It's not just the feeling, it's…the worry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Raymonde. Worry can certainly add to the discomfort. And it’s good you’re telling me about this. Now, besides the nausea and discomfort, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Changes… Well, I've been…tired. More tired than usual, even for an old woman like me. And…I don’t know if this is related, but I seem to be…going to the bathroom more often. Not…diarrhea, exactly. Just…more frequent trips. And…oh! My weight. I think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven’t been keeping track. It’s hard to say for sure. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? It’s all so vague, Doctor. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: You are being a great help, Raymonde. Don't worry about being vague – we'll piece things together. Fatigue, increased bathroom trips, and possible weight loss… all important things to know. Let’s talk about your bowel movements a little more specifically. Is there any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. That's…a rather personal question, isn't it? Well… now that you mention it… there was a little bit of red in there once, maybe a week or so ago. I thought it might have been something I ate, or a hemorrhoid acting up. I didn't think much of it at the time. It didn't happen again, thankfully. It wasn't a lot, mind you. Just a spot. But…yes. There was a little bit of blood. I feel awful even bringing it up. It probably means something bad, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Raymonde. It’s good you told me. It doesn't necessarily mean something bad, but it is something we need to investigate. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any pain in any other part of your body?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…tired all over, like I said. My joints ache a bit sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. I've always been fairly sturdy. I used to ride horses all the time, you see. Cherokee folk are close to the land, always have been. But nothing new there. No sharp pains, or anything like that. Mostly just…this feeling in my belly, and the tiredness. It's hard to describe. Like my body is…wearing out. I don't know if that makes sense. But honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to get a little scared.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Raymonde. And it's perfectly alright to be scared. That’s a very natural feeling when you're not feeling well and don't know what's going on. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Land, that's a good question. My memory…it's like a sieve these days. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years back? And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. I've always been pretty healthy, though. I've never been one to sit around and complain. As for other conditions… I think I had high blood pressure for a while, but it was well-controlled with medication. I don't even remember what the medication was called anymore. My late husband, bless his heart, he used to keep track of all that. I'm just not good with names and dates, you see. It's a terrible thing getting old.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Raymonde. We'll take our time. So, gallbladder removal about 30 years ago, childhood illnesses, and high blood pressure that was controlled with medication. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think I take something for my arthritis. A little white pill, once a day. And… oh! And a baby aspirin, my regular doctor told me to take it to help my heart. That's all I can think of right now, Doctor. I keep them in a little dish by the sink, but sometimes I forget if I’ve taken them or not. My memory is just…gone to pot, I tell you. I used to be so organized, but now…well, it's a mess. I apologize for being so rambling. I'm probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Raymonde. Don’t apologize at all. So, medication for arthritis and a baby aspirin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or plants?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not ever. I eat pretty much everything, and I spend a lot of time outdoors with my animals, so I’m around all sorts of plants. I’ve never felt anything bad, never had a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that. My mother always said the Cherokee are strong folk, resilient. I reckon that’s true. But…I'm starting to worry about this tiredness and the nausea. It's just not like me. I always prided myself on my strength.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies, Raymonde. And it’s perfectly natural to be worried when your health changes. Alright, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother lived to be a good old age, but she had…what was it? Something with her heart, I think. She was always tired and short of breath towards the end. My father… he didn't live as long. He died of a lung problem, I think. He used to work in the coal mines, so it’s no surprise, really. And my brother… he had diabetes. He wasn't very careful with his diet, bless his heart. As for other conditions… I don’t really know, Doctor. My family wasn't one for talking about health problems, not much. It was just…understood. You know? Things just were. It wasn't something we discussed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Raymonde. It's common for families not to discuss these things. So, heart problems in your mother, lung problems in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother always said tobacco was the devil's weed. She wouldn't let anyone smoke in the house, not ever. And I took after her. Never had a taste for it. I prefer the fresh air, you see. Being outdoors with my animals is my life. I do enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes, but only a glass or two. Nothing excessive. I've always been a moderate person. I believe in taking care of myself, but… this tiredness and nausea… it's just wearing me down. I'm getting scared, Doctor. I really am.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be scared, Raymonde. And it sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy lifestyle, which is wonderful. Now, just a few more questions. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I just answered that, didn't I? A little wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass or two, never more. I don't drink hard liquor, and I certainly don't drink every day. Maybe a couple of times a week, when I'm feeling sociable. It helps me relax, you see. But it's nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a drinker, not really. I just enjoy a little bit of wine with my food sometimes. Is that alright? I'm probably repeating myself. My memory…it’s just terrible. I apologize.
DOCTOR: You're not repeating yourself at all, Raymonde. And you're doing wonderfully. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture. Just making sure. Okay. Now, let's talk a little about your social life. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband passed away five years ago. It’s been lonely sometimes, but I keep busy with my animals. They’re my family now, you see. I have a few friends I see occasionally, mostly for coffee or a chat. I used to volunteer at the animal shelter, but I haven’t been able to lately with this tiredness. It just takes too much energy. I mostly just stay home and take care of my dogs. They need me, you see. They depend on me. It's a good life, but… it would be nice to have someone around sometimes. Someone to share things with. But I manage. I always have. It’s just…this feeling, this sickness… it’s making everything harder.
DOCTOR: That sounds very difficult, Raymonde. Losing your husband must have been incredibly hard. And it’s admirable that you’re taking such good care of your dogs. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. I trust your judgment. Just…be gentle, alright? My old bones aren't what they used to be. I don’t like being poked and prodded, but I understand it's necessary. Just let me know what you're doing, so I don't get too startled. And…if it hurts, I'll let you know. I'm not afraid of a little discomfort, but I do get nervous easily. Just…be gentle, alright? I appreciate it. This whole thing is just…frightening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Raymonde. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. We’ll take it slow, and you can let me know if anything is uncomfortable at any time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. And one more… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your lungs sound clear, though. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: Well, that's a little uncomfortable, Doctor. Not painful, exactly. But it's…heavy. Like there's something pressing down. It’s hard to describe. Just… uncomfortable. Especially over there, on the right side. It doesn’t feel like a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And it makes me a little nauseous, just pressing on it. It's like something is swollen, maybe? I don't know. I'm not a doctor, you see. Just…uncomfortable. And a little heavy. Like a weight pressing down on my belly. It's been worse lately, I think. Is that normal? I'm probably just worrying too much. But this sickness… it's just so frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some tenderness in your right upper quadrant, as you mentioned, and a bit of fullness. It doesn’t feel like an acute pain, but there is definitely some discomfort there. Any discomfort down here?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Just a little…tightness. Like I haven’t…moved around much lately. It's not painful, just… uncomfortable. Like everything is… sluggish, you know? My bowels haven’t been right for a while now, but I didn't think much of it. Old age, I reckoned. But now… pressing on it… it feels a little swollen, maybe? I don't know. I'm probably just imagining things. It’s hard to tell, you see. I'm not used to being poked and prodded. It’s just… uncomfortable. And a little frightening. Is this something serious, Doctor? I'm getting scared. Really scared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde. I’m noting some mild tenderness and fullness throughout your abdomen. It’s good that you're letting me know what you’re feeling. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I want to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan will give us a better look at your organs. I know this sounds like a lot, and it’s perfectly alright to be scared. But these tests will help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms, so we can get you the right treatment. Would you have any trouble getting to a facility for a CT scan?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan… Land, that sounds serious, doesn’t it? Well, I can get there, I reckon. My friend, Martha, she drives me around sometimes. She’s a good friend. But…what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it…cancer? The other doctor said something about cancer, but I don’t rightly remember the details. I’m just…so worried. I don’t want to be sick. I just want to be able to take care of my dogs. They need me. Is it…bad? Be honest with me, Doctor. I can handle it. I’ve been through a lot in my life. But…is it bad? And…will these tests hurt? I'm just…frightened. Really frightened.
DOCTOR: Raymonde, it’s perfectly alright to be frightened. And I appreciate your honesty. The CT scan is a tool to help us rule things out and figure out what's going on. The other doctor mentioned the possibility of cancer, and it's good we're taking that seriously. However, there are many other things that can cause your symptoms, and we need to investigate those as well. The CT scan itself doesn’t hurt. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your abdomen and pelvis. You might need to drink some contrast liquid beforehand, which can taste a little unpleasant, but it’s not harmful. I want to be upfront with you, Raymonde. Your symptoms, along with the tenderness in your abdomen, could be a sign of something serious. But it’s too early to say for sure. The tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I’ll be here to answer all your questions. I’ll also give you a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – to get a second opinion. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… that sounds…serious. But alright, Doctor. If you think it's best. I trust your judgment. I just… I'm so worried about my dogs. Who will take care of them if I get sick? They need their food and their walks and their…love. They depend on me. And… what if it is cancer? What happens then? Will I be in pain? Will I have to go to the hospital? I’ve always been a homebody. I don’t like being away from my animals. And… what about Martha? She’s getting older too. I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. Oh, land, this is just…overwhelming. I just want to know what’s going on. I just want to feel better. And I want to be able to take care of my dogs. That’s all I want. Please, Doctor. Tell me it will be alright. Or… tell me the truth. I can handle it. But…please. Tell me the truth. And…will these tests take long? I have to get home to feed the pups. They’ll be hungry.
DOCTOR: Raymonde, it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. You’re right to be worried about your dogs, and it’s admirable that you’re so dedicated to their care. Let's take things one step at a time. First, the tests. The blood work will take about an hour to complete, and the CT scan will take about 30-45 minutes. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, which usually takes a day or two. Now, about the possibility of cancer. If it is cancer, there are many different treatment options available, depending on the type and stage. These can include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. We’ll work with you to find the best treatment plan for your specific situation. And yes, treatment can sometimes involve pain, but we have many effective ways to manage pain and make you comfortable. You wouldn’t have to go through this alone. We have a wonderful support team – nurses, social workers, and therapists – who can help you every step of the way. And we'll do everything we can to minimize disruption to your daily life and keep you comfortable at home. I can't promise you it will be alright, Raymonde. I don't have all the answers yet. But I can promise you that I will be here for you. We’ll work together to figure out what's going on and find the best way to get you feeling better. And we'll make sure your dogs are taken care of, no matter what. We can discuss options for temporary care if needed. Let's start with getting those tests ordered. And I'll give you the referral to the gastroenterologist. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh… temporary care for the pups… that would be a relief. Martha's good, but she's got her own problems. I don't want to burden her. Okay…tests. That sounds… scary, but alright. If you think it’s best. And the gastroenterologist… alright. What… what if it is bad? What kind of pain are we talking about? And… what about my dogs? Can they come with me to the hospital? They get anxious when I'm gone. And… will I lose my hair? I’ve heard about that with cancer. I don’t want to lose my hair. Oh, land… this is just… too much. I need to think. Can I… can I have a little water? My mouth is so dry. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me. It's just… a lot to take in. I need to… to think. About my dogs. And… about my hair. And… about everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. Take your time. And you’re very welcome. It’s alright to feel overwhelmed, and it's perfectly okay to need a moment. Let’s address your concerns one by one. The type of pain associated with cancer varies greatly depending on the type and location. Some cancers cause very little pain, while others can be quite painful. We have many effective ways to manage pain, including medications, physical therapy, and other therapies. We'll work with you to find the best way to control your pain if needed. As for your dogs, I understand how important they are to you. Unfortunately, most hospitals do not allow pets. However, we can discuss options for boarding them at a pet-friendly facility or arranging for a friend or family member to care for them while you’re receiving treatment. And yes, some cancer treatments can cause hair loss. However, not all treatments do, and there are ways to manage hair loss if it does occur, such as wearing a wig or head covering. We can discuss these options with you if needed. Raymonde, I want to be upfront with you. We don’t know what’s going on yet, and it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Let’s focus on getting those tests done and figuring out what we’re dealing with. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Would you like me to call Martha to see if she can come and stay with you for a bit?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That would be… nice. Martha always calms me down. Just… knowing she's here. And… about the tests. What do I have to do? Do I have to fast? Will it hurt? I'm just… scared. I haven't been to a doctor in years. And… what if it's something really bad? What if… what if I don't make it? I just… I need to take care of my dogs. They need me. Who will take care of them if I'm not here? Oh, land… this is just… too much. I need to… to think. Can I just… sit here for a minute? And… thank you, Doctor. For being so kind. You're a good doctor. A very good doctor. But… I need to… to think. About my dogs. And… about everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. Take all the time you need. I'm here, and there's no rush. I completely understand your concerns, and it's perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Regarding the tests, the blood work requires about 12 hours of fasting, meaning you shouldn’t eat or drink anything except water before the test. The phlebotomist – the person who draws your blood – will be very gentle, and it shouldn't hurt much. You might feel a slight pinch, but it's usually over quickly. As for the CT scan, you'll need to drink a contrast liquid beforehand, which can taste a little unpleasant, but it’s not harmful. You’ll lie on a table, and the machine will take pictures of your abdomen and pelvis. It doesn't hurt, but you'll need to lie still for about 30-45 minutes. And Raymonde, I understand your concerns about your dogs. You're a wonderful pet owner, and it’s admirable that you’re so dedicated to their care. We can absolutely make arrangements for them to be taken care of if needed. I can help you find a reputable boarding facility or arrange for a friend or family member to care for them. We will make sure they're safe and comfortable, no matter what. We're going to take things one step at a time, Raymonde. Let's focus on getting those tests done and figuring out what we're dealing with. We'll discuss all your options and make sure you have all the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. And I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Right now, just breathe. Take your time. And I'm here to listen if you want to talk. Or if you just want to sit quietly for a minute, that's perfectly okay too. Whatever you need, just let me know. And…would you like me to call Martha?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. You’re… you’re very kind. And… yes. Please call Martha. Just… knowing she's here would be… nice. And… the pups. They need their dinner. And their walks. And… their love. Who will take care of them if I… if something happens? They depend on me. They’re all I have left. I just… I need to know they’ll be safe. That they’ll be loved. That they won’t be alone. That’s all I ask. Just… please. Make sure they’re safe. And… thank you. For listening. For being kind. For… for everything. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. And… I’m scared. So very scared.
DOCTOR: Raymonde, you don't have to be scared alone. I promise you, we will do everything we can to make sure your pups are safe and loved. That’s my priority, and it’s something we can absolutely take care of. I’m going to call Martha now, and we’ll discuss arrangements for your pups. She’s a good friend, and I’m sure she’ll be happy to help. We can explore all your options – boarding facilities, friends or family members, or whatever works best for you and your pups. We’ll make sure they’re comfortable, safe, and loved, no matter what. And Raymonde, I want you to know that I’m here for you. You're not alone in this. I'll be with you every step of the way, and we'll face whatever comes together. You've taken wonderful care of your dogs, and it's admirable that you're so dedicated to their well-being. We will make sure they continue to receive the love and care they deserve, no matter what. “Hello, Martha?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. Please… tell Martha to bring the pups’ favorite toys. And their blankets. They get anxious without them. And… tell her to give them extra love. They miss me when I’m gone. And… thank you. For everything. You’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. And… I’m scared. So very scared. But… knowing my pups will be safe… that helps. That helps a lot.
DOCTOR: “Yes, Martha, she wanted me to let you know to bring their favorite toys and blankets. They get anxious without them, and she asked me to tell you to give them extra love – they miss her when she’s gone.” “Yes, she understands. She’s a good friend, Martha. And thank you for being so willing to help.” “Martha is on her way, Raymonde. She said she’ll bring the pups’ toys and blankets and give them extra love. She’s happy to help, and she understands how important they are to you.” “And Raymonde, it’s perfectly okay to be scared. It’s a natural reaction to what you’re going through. But you’re not alone in this, and we’ll face it together. We'll focus on getting those tests done and figuring out what we’re dealing with. And we’ll make sure your pups are safe and loved, no matter what.” “Now, let’s just breathe. Take your time. And I’m here to listen if you want to talk. Or if you just want to sit quietly for a minute, that’s perfectly okay too. Whatever you need, just let me know. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time.” “Would you like me to call someone else to come and stay with you for a bit?
PATIENT: No… no, that’s alright. Martha is enough. She’s a good friend. A very good friend. Just… thank you. For everything. For being so kind. For listening. For… for everything. I think… I think I just need to sit here for a minute. And… breathe. And… thank you. Just… thank you. That’s all. Just… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It’s my pleasure. And you don't have to say anything. Just breathe. Take your time. I’ll be here if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to let me know. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. .
PATIENT: .
