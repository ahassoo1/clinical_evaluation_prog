DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s…a rather delicate matter, truthfully. Not something a man discusses easily, you understand. I’ve noticed…a bit of discharge. A most unpleasant surprise, I assure you. It’s been…a few days now, I believe. Though my memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable talking about this, Mr. Krok, and you’re right to get it checked out. We’ll figure this out together. “A bit of discharge” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest idea how much is “a bit.” It’s…well, it’s there. And it’s not…clear, if you catch my meaning. A bit yellowish, perhaps? And…sticky. It's quite bothersome, really. A gentleman shouldn't have to deal with such things. My wife, bless her soul, noticed it first, of course. She has a keen eye for…unseemliness.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Krok. It’s good your wife noticed and that you’re addressing it. Yellowish and sticky discharge… that gives me a bit more information. Is there any odor associated with it?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…yes. A faint one, thankfully. Not…overpowering, but…not pleasant. A bit…fishy, perhaps? Though I wouldn’t want to insult your sense of smell by asking you to confirm that. It’s just…not the aroma one associates with a clean, respectable man. My wife…she also commented on it, naturally. She has a very sensitive nose, you see. A blessing and a curse, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint, fishy odor… that’s helpful information. And it’s good you’re both observant. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… other symptoms… Well, there’s a slight…burning sensation when I…urinate. Not terribly painful, mind you, but…noticeable. And…a bit of discomfort, a sort of ache, lower down. It’s not constant, comes and goes. I haven't noticed any…swelling, thankfully. Or…fever. I do feel a bit tired lately, but that’s likely just old age catching up with me, isn’t it? I’m 83, you know. Things just…wear out.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, a bit of lower abdominal discomfort, and some fatigue. Thank you for detailing that for me, Mr. Krok. Now, have you had any changes in your urinary habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my…urinary habits? Now you're asking things I haven't given much thought to, Doctor. Let me see… I suppose I've been going to the bathroom a bit more frequently lately. But again, that could be the tea. My wife insists on me drinking several cups a day. Says it's good for my…constitution. And…perhaps a bit of dribbling after I finish. A small amount, mind you, nothing to be alarmed about, I’m sure. It's just…a gentleman doesn't like to speak of such things. Do you need me to be more…specific?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Mr. Krok. You’re providing very helpful information. More frequent urination and a bit of dribbling… okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… a rather long and tedious tale, I assure you. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, a nasty bout it was. And my wife insists my cholesterol is a bit high, she’s always nagging me about my diet. As for more serious conditions… I believe the doctor once mentioned something about my prostate being… enlarged. Years ago, mind you. I don’t recall the specifics. I take a few pills for…well, for general aches and pains. And for my heart. Something about palpitations. Honestly, Doctor, I leave the details to my wife. She manages all of that. Medicare covers it, thankfully. I haven’t been feeling particularly well lately, but I suppose that’s to be expected at my age. Is this information useful? Or are we delving into unnecessary details?
DOCTOR: This is all very useful, Mr. Krok, thank you. Enlarged prostate, palpitations, and some pills for aches and pains… okay. Do you know the names of the medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Names of the medications… Oh dear. That’s where my memory truly fails me, Doctor. My wife keeps a list, of course. A very meticulous list, color-coded and everything. But I haven’t memorized them. There’s a little white pill I take in the morning, and a pink one at night. And something for my heart… a small blue tablet, I believe. Honestly, I just take what she gives me. She’s very particular about the dosage and the timing. Asking me the names would likely only lead to confusion and frustration. I'm afraid I'm not much help on that front. Perhaps you could ask my wife? She has a remarkable memory for such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Krok. We can certainly ask your wife. Before we do that, let's quickly go over your surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. A rather unpleasant experience, those things. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. And… I believe I had a hernia operation sometime in my sixties. A rather small one, nothing to write home about. And… Oh, yes! I had my tonsils out as a boy. A rather painful recovery, I recall. I don't believe I've had any surgeries since then, at least not that I recall. It’s been a long life, Doctor. A lot of things get… forgotten. Is that sufficient? Or are you looking for something more specific?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Krok. Appendix, hernia, and tonsils… okay. Now, one last thing regarding your history. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no, I don't believe so. I’ve always been a rather robust fellow, thankfully. I can tolerate most things. Perhaps a bit of a sensitivity to dust, but that’s hardly an allergy. And I don’t particularly care for shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not a medical condition. I've never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always checks when she's preparing meals, of course. She’s very cautious about such things. No, no allergies to speak of. Are we finished with the history now? It’s rather exhausting, dredging up all these old memories.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, we’re finished with the history. Thank you for being so patient and sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a quick genital exam to better understand what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A…genital exam? Oh dear. Well, that’s… rather personal, isn’t it? I suppose if it’s necessary for the diagnosis… but I must confess, Doctor, I’m not entirely comfortable with that. Is there absolutely no other way? I trust your judgment, of course, but… a gentleman prefers to avoid such examinations if possible. Is it absolutely essential? And will it be…discreet? My wife wouldn’t approve if I discussed such things. Perhaps we could start with the heart and lungs? And then…reconsider the other part?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. You’re right to ask. A genital exam will help me assess the source of the discharge and rule out any infections or other issues. It’s a standard part of evaluating these types of symptoms, and I assure you, I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. We can certainly start with your heart and lungs, and then discuss the other part again. I want you to feel comfortable throughout this process. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Start with the heart and lungs, then. But please, be gentle. And…discreet. I still maintain that a gentleman shouldn’t have to endure such things, but I trust your expertise. Lead the way. And perhaps…a brief explanation before you proceed with the other part? I’m an old man, you see. Easily flustered.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything before we proceed. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please lie back on the examination table. Okay, breathing deeply for me… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from anxiety or just your activity level. I hear a slight murmur, but it’s likely something you’ve had for a while and not acutely concerning. Lungs sound clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on different areas to see if you feel any pain or tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A bit… yes, a bit tender there, on the lower left side. Not terribly painful, mind you, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes, as I mentioned earlier. Perhaps it’s just indigestion? I had a rather heavy lunch, I recall. A bit of roast beef, and a slice of apple pie. My wife spoils me, you see. Is that area significant, Doctor? Or is it just an old man’s complaining?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the lower left side. That could be a few things, Mr. Krok, and we’ll need to investigate further. Now, as we discussed, to get a better understanding of the discharge and rule out any infection, I would like to perform a quick genital exam. It involves a visual inspection and possibly a swab to collect a sample. It will be as quick and discreet as possible, and I will explain each step as I go. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is…difficult. I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… But please, Doctor, be as gentle as you can. And explain everything beforehand, as you promised. I still maintain that a gentleman shouldn’t have to endure such things. But…very well. Proceed. But slowly, please. And…discreetly. I trust your professionalism, Doctor. Just…be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your discomfort, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. I’ll explain each step as I go. First, I’m going to gently lift the scrotum and visually inspect the area for any redness, swelling, or abnormalities. Okay, I’m just taking a look now… I do see some slight redness around the opening of the urethra, and there’s a small amount of whitish discharge present. No obvious swelling or lesions. Now, I’m going to use a sterile swab to collect a small sample of the discharge. This will be sent to the lab for analysis to identify any bacteria or other organisms that might be causing the infection. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it should be very quick. Okay, just a quick swab now… all done. That’s all I need for the exam, Mr. Krok. Thank you for your patience. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Okay, now let’s discuss the next steps…
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t as dreadful as I anticipated, thankfully. Though I still maintain that a gentleman shouldn’t have to endure such things. But thank you, Doctor, for your gentleness and discretion. Now, what did you find? And what are the “next steps”? I’m rather anxious to get this sorted out. Will it require… medication? Or something more…invasive? I’m not particularly fond of needles, you see. And please, no complicated medical jargon. Just tell me, in plain language, what’s going on and what needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. Based on the exam, I’m suspecting a possible urinary tract infection or urethritis – an inflammation of the urethra. The redness and discharge support that. It’s common, especially as we get older. The lab results will confirm what’s causing the infection, and then we can determine the best course of treatment. In most cases, it’s treated with a course of antibiotics. Fortunately, it’s usually very effective. The antibiotics are typically taken orally, so no needles are involved! We’ll discuss the specific medication and dosage once we have the lab results. I’m also going to order a urine analysis to check for any other issues, like blood or protein in the urine. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. And avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… orally, you say? No needles, thankfully. That’s a relief. And plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine and alcohol… I can manage that. My wife will be pleased. She’s always nagging me about my diet anyway. So, we wait for the lab results, then? How long will that take? And what if… what if it’s something more serious? I’m rather prone to worrying, you see. Old age, perhaps. And I appreciate you explaining everything in plain language, Doctor. It’s a great comfort. Just tell me… what are the chances of it being something… serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. The lab results usually take 2-3 business days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they're available. As for the chances of it being something more serious, it's unlikely. Most cases of discharge like this are caused by a simple infection. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, which is why we're doing the lab tests. If the lab results show something more concerning – like a sexually transmitted infection or a more complicated urinary issue – we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment options at that time. But let’s not worry about that right now. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, focus on drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. And try to relax. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been most reassuring. And I appreciate your patience with an old man’s anxieties. I’ll focus on the fluids, and avoid the caffeine and alcohol. My wife will be pleased to hear that. And I’ll wait for the nurse to contact me with the results. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been most helpful. I suppose I’ll just… get off this table now? And try to avoid worrying too much. Though that’s easier said than done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. And yes, please, get off the table whenever you're ready. I’ll have my nurse come in and give you discharge instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Krok.
