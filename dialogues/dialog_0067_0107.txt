DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s been happening for a little while now. I think maybe a month? It makes me feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” – can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm... not like pain, no pain. Just… flutters. Like a bird inside, maybe? Not strong, just… quick. And sometimes it feels like it skips a beat. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. It’s not all the time, though. Mostly when I rest, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. “Fluttering” and “skipping” are good ways to describe it. And you said it happens mostly when you're resting?
PATIENT: Yes. When I work, I don’t really feel it. I work with… machines, big machines. Keeps me busy. But when I sit down, or lie down to sleep… that's when I notice it. Sometimes it wakes me up at night. It’s not every night, but… enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned feeling tired. Is that constant tiredness, or does it seem related to these episodes with your heart?
PATIENT: It’s more when the heart feels funny. I sleep okay, I think. But then I wake up feeling… not fresh. Like I didn’t sleep good, even if I did. So, yeah, mostly when the heart is doing the flutters. Not all day, every day tired, just… after. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. So, the tiredness seems to be linked to these episodes. Have you noticed anything that brings on these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing I can think of. I drink tea, sometimes. Black tea. But I drink it every day. I don’t think that’s it. I haven’t changed anything I eat, or do. It just… started. That’s why I came. It worries my wife. She said I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific triggers that you've noticed. And you drink black tea regularly. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve never been to a doctor much, to be honest. Just when I break a bone, maybe. Or a bad cold. My wife, she goes to the doctor a lot more than me. But me? Never anything… serious. I feel okay, usually. Just this heart thing now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good health. No prior medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never. Just… a lot of bumps and bruises from work, maybe. But nothing that needed a doctor to cut. I work with the machines, so… sometimes things happen. But nothing serious enough for surgery. My wife worries about that too, sometimes. She says I need to be more careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family... hmm. My father, he had a weak heart when he was old. But he lived a long life, almost eighty. My mother, she was healthy. No heart problems. I think my brother, he has high blood pressure, but that’s it. We don’t talk much, so I don’t really know. He lives far away. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, a family history of some heart issues with your father, and high blood pressure with your brother. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife, she doesn’t like smoking. So I don’t. I drink a little tea, like I said, but not much. And I don’t drink… strong drink. Maybe a little sometimes, with dinner, but not often. Mostly tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I can eat anything. No problems with food. And I haven’t taken any medicine for a long time, except maybe for a headache, sometimes. Just… the normal things. Nothing special. I don’t like taking medicine if I don’t need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My wife said I should come, and I want to know what’s going on with my heart. Just tell me if anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not terribly concerning. Your pulse is regular, but I am detecting a slightly rapid heart rate - about 90 beats per minute. And I do hear a very faint irregularity when listening to your heart. It's subtle, but it’s there. I also want to note your respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute and lungs are clear to auscultation. Based on what you’ve told me and this exam, I’d like to order an EKG and some blood work to get a better picture of what’s going on. The EKG will record your heart's electrical activity, and the blood work will check things like your thyroid function and electrolyte levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good. EKG and blood work. I don’t know what that means, exactly, but if you think it’s best, then yes. My wife will be glad I’m getting it checked. What do I have to do? Where do I go? Will it take long? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The EKG is quick and painless. It involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes about 10-15 minutes. The blood work will involve a quick draw of blood – just a few vials. That will take another 15-20 minutes. There's a lab right across the hall. I'll write you a requisition form, and the lab technician will take it from there. I’ll also have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results, probably in a few days. It may take 24-48 hours to get the results back. I don't think it will interfere with your work schedule, but you might feel a little tired afterward, so maybe take it easy tomorrow. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds okay. Stickers and blood… not so bad. Across the hall is good. I can do that. And take it easy tomorrow… I can tell my boss. He’s okay, usually. And a few days to get the results… good. Thank you, Doctor. My wife will be happy. Is there anything else I need to do now?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Puder. Just take this form to the lab across the hall. They'll get you checked in. The nurse will also give you instructions on when to schedule your follow-up appointment. While we wait for the results, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Chest pain, shortness of breath… emergency room. I understand. I will remember that. Thank you again. I think that’s everything, then? I can go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's everything for today. You can go to the lab now. And please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Mr. Puder. And please, take it easy.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
