DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this trouble I’ve been having. With… going to the bathroom. It keeps happening again and again. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it’s… bothersome. Very bothersome, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Trouble going to the bathroom” can be quite disruptive. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on. When you say "trouble," could you describe exactly what that means for you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Describe… well, it burns, Doctor. When I… when I go. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just have. It's… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I don’t know what else to tell you. It’s just… a feeling. A bad feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright, burning with urination and a frequent urge to go, even after you’ve just been. That’s helpful. Do you experience any pain between bathroom visits, or is it solely during urination?
PATIENT: Pain… between? Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. It’s mostly when I go. Sometimes… a little ache, low down, but not much. It's hard to say, Doctor. I don’t pay much attention to aches, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if it's hard to pinpoint. A little ache low down is good to know. Now, is there anything that seems to trigger these symptoms – certain foods, drinks, or activities?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Oh, goodness. I drink a lot of tea, you know. Herbal tea. Chamomile, mostly. And… sometimes I have a little glass of wine with dinner. Does that matter? I don't know if that causes anything. I eat… regular food. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, herbal tea and occasional wine. That's good to know. Sometimes certain beverages can irritate the bladder. And regular food is helpful information as well. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, now you’re asking me things I don’t pay attention to! Let me think. It… it looks normal, I suppose. The usual color. Sometimes it's a little darker if I don't drink enough water. But other than that… no, I haven’t noticed anything different.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's alright. It's common not to notice small changes. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, no fever. Not that I’m aware of. Chills… well, it gets a little cool at night, but that’s just the air conditioning. And… my back? Oh, my back always aches a little. Old age, you know. It’s just… a general ache. Not anything new with this trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no new chills or back pain. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… Well, I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor gave me a little pill and it went away. Other than that… not that I recall. I’ve always been a healthy woman, mostly. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little history of blood pressure that was managed with medication. That’s good to know. Do you recall the name of that medication, or roughly when you were taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… no, I don’t remember the name. It was a little white pill. I took it for… oh, I don’t know. A few months, maybe? It was a long time ago. I stopped taking it when the doctor said my blood pressure was alright. I really don’t pay attention to those things, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you don't recall the specific name. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Well, I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. That was… a long time ago. Other than that, no. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Just the gallbladder.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Well… I used to get a little itchy when I touched poison ivy, but that’s just poison ivy, isn’t it? Not a real allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just a little vitamin C sometimes, when I feel a cold coming on. But I haven’t taken any in weeks. I try to eat healthy, you see, so I don't need much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamin C. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family, like your parents or siblings, had any problems with kidney disease, bladder problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Well, my mother… she had a little trouble with her kidneys when she was very old, but she lived to be ninety-five, so it couldn’t have been too bad. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. Yes, diabetes. But he didn't take care of himself, you see. He ate too much sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some kidney trouble later in life, and your brother had diabetes. Thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Well, I live alone, you see. I keep house, I do a little gardening. I watch television. I drink my tea. Not very exciting, I suppose. I don’t do much traveling anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We’ll just check your abdomen and take your blood pressure. Then, I’d like to order a urine test to look for any infection or other abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want this trouble to go away. The sooner, the better, yes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just lie down on the table, we can get started. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to the touch. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now... they're normal. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'll need a urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if possible. Do you know how to do that?
PATIENT: Midstream…? No, Doctor. I don't think so. I just… go when I need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. I'll explain it to you. It's very simple. When you go to the bathroom, start urinating, and then, after a few seconds, collect the urine in the cup. We want the sample from the middle of your stream, as the first part may have bacteria from the skin. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… the middle. So, I start, and then… catch it after a little bit? Like a second part? Is that right? I hope I can do it properly. I don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Exactly! Start urinating, and then collect a small amount – about an ounce or two – in the cup after you've been going for a few seconds. You’re doing great just asking questions. Don’t worry about messing it up. Just do your best. There’s a bathroom right over there. Take your time, and let me know when you’re finished. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'll try my best. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. I hope I can manage.
