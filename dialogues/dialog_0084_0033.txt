DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s rather… inconvenient, to be frank. My vision, and my hearing, have both been… going. It happened quite suddenly, you see. Honestly, I haven't the time for this. I have patients of my own to attend to, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are concerning, and I appreciate you coming in despite your busy schedule. "Suddenly" can mean different things, though. Can you tell me about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It was… a few days ago, I suppose. It's all a bit of a blur. I was… at the opera, I think? Or perhaps a gala? It truly doesn't matter. What does matter is that I couldn't quite see the stage clearly, and the music sounded… muffled. I simply assumed it was a poor performance. Though now... it's not improving, is it? Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few days ago, changes at the opera or a gala… I see. And has this been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, Doctor. Utterly constant. Though, perhaps… a little better in the mornings? But only slightly. It's enough to be… bothersome, let’s put it that way. I need my senses sharp, you understand. I’m a surgeon. A pediatric surgeon, at that. I can’t be dealing with blurry sights and indistinct sounds. It’s simply… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Right. So, constant with slight improvement in the mornings. That's helpful to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, must we delve into every detail? I haven’t felt unwell, if that's what you mean. Perhaps a little… fatigued. But that's hardly noteworthy. I work very long hours, as I’ve already explained. It’s probably just… exhaustion. Really, I suspect it’s just stress. Though, I can't be certain. This entire situation is rather… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, possibly related to stress and long hours. No other symptoms like headache, dizziness, ringing in the ears, or any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Headache? No. Dizziness? Certainly not. Ringing… well, perhaps a slight tinnitus, but I've had that on and off for years. It’s hardly new. And pain… no. I certainly wouldn't describe it as painful. Simply… inconvenient. Honestly, Doctor, are these endless questions truly necessary? I have a schedule to maintain, you know. A very full schedule. Can we not simply… diagnose and remedy this?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your time, Ms. Julie, and I do apologize for the number of questions. It's important for me to gather a complete picture of your symptoms so I can ensure I make the correct assessment. You mentioned slight tinnitus for years… has that changed recently, or is it the same as usual?
PATIENT: Changed? Honestly, Doctor, I barely notice the tinnitus most days. It’s a minor annoyance, at best. Perhaps it’s a little… louder now? But I can't be certain. Everything feels a little… muted, if I’m being truthful. It's all rather… disconcerting. Really, I’d prefer not to dwell on it. It's all so... unpleasant. Can we move on to the examination, please? I’m quite sure a simple test will reveal the problem. It’s probably nothing serious. Though, I do have a gala to attend next week… it would be dreadful to miss that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick exam then. We'll start with your vision. Could you please follow my penlight as I move it back and forth?
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. I have responsibilities, you know. A rather important foundation dinner tonight, as a matter of fact. Don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes, which is a slight decrease. And I'm noticing some mild difficulty with your peripheral vision in the outer fields. Now, let’s check your hearing. I’m going to put these headphones on, and I’ll play some tones at different frequencies. Please tell me when you hear them, even if they’re faint.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather… undignified. I’m a surgeon, not a child. But proceed, if you must. Just please, be swift. And avoid any high-pitched tones, if possible. They’re terribly irritating. I… I think I hear something now. Very faintly. Though it’s hard to tell with all the background noise. This clinic isn't exactly soundproof, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your hearing is slightly diminished in both ears, particularly in the higher frequencies. It’s not severe, but noticeable. Based on these preliminary findings, your vision and hearing loss seem to be mild and symmetrical, but warrants further investigation. There are several possibilities, Ms. Julie. It could be age-related changes, but given the sudden onset, we need to rule out other causes. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Autoimmune conditions? Good heavens, no! I maintain a very strict regimen, Doctor. Organic everything, regular exercise, minimal stress... well, as minimal as one can get, given my profession. And blood pressure? Perfectly normal, I assure you. I have it checked regularly. Honestly, the idea that I would have such a common ailment is… frankly, insulting. I suspect it’s simply… a temporary setback. Perhaps a virus. Though I haven’t felt unwell, as I’ve already stated. Really, I don’t see the need for extensive testing. It’s probably nothing serious. Can we not simply… monitor it for a few weeks? And perhaps prescribe some eye drops?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie. However, given the sudden onset and the changes in both vision and hearing, "monitoring" isn't the safest course of action at this time. We need to investigate potential causes further. I would like to order a comprehensive blood panel to check for underlying medical conditions, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural issues. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Good heavens, Doctor, are you serious? The time commitment alone is… unacceptable. And blood tests? Truly? I haven’t had a proper blood panel in years! It’s simply… unnecessary. And frankly, quite alarming. I highly doubt there’s anything “structurally” wrong with my brain. I’m a surgeon, remember? My mind is my livelihood! This is all… quite excessive. I think I’ll get a second opinion. Yes, a second opinion is definitely in order. I have a colleague at St. Jude’s… a far more experienced physician, I assure you. He’ll know what to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. I respect your decision to seek a second opinion. However, please be aware that delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen the underlying condition. I'll provide you with a copy of your chart and my findings. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if your symptoms worsen or if you have any concerns. Thank you for coming in. .
