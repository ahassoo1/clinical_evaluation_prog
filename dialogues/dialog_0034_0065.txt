DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… gaining weight. And it’s quite unsettling, as I haven’t changed my habits at all. It’s been happening for a few months now, and I wanted to see if we could figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight gain without changes in habits can certainly be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. To get a better picture of what’s happening, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed the weight gain, and roughly how much weight we’re talking about?
PATIENT: It started, I believe, around… February, perhaps? It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, but that feels right. And… well, I’ve gained approximately 15 kilograms, maybe a little more. It’s quite noticeable, Doctor. My clothes are fitting tighter, and I simply feel… heavier. I haven't been weighing myself religiously, if that makes sense, but that’s a reasonable estimate.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately 15 kilograms since February. That is a significant change. And you haven’t noticed any changes to your diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I eat roughly the same things I always have – mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes, I confess, though I do try to incorporate vegetables. And I walk every day, about an hour, as I always have. It’s… baffling, truly. I haven’t altered my routine in any discernible way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Let me see… not particularly, no. Perhaps… I’ve been feeling a little more tired lately, but I attribute that to the summer heat, to be honest. And… well, my hands feel a bit cold more often than they used to. But truly, Doctor, those are minor things. Nothing dramatic. The weight gain is the primary concern. I’m not sleeping badly, no changes to my bowel habits… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling more tired and cold hands. We’ll definitely keep those in mind. To get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I haven't had any serious illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood ailments, measles, mumps… nothing significant. As an adult, I’ve only ever needed treatment for occasional headaches, and I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. No allergies, no chronic conditions… and I'm currently taking no medication. My husband, bless him, has high blood pressure, but that’s his issue, not mine. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. Which makes this all the more worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant past medical history, gallbladder removal ten years ago, no allergies, and no current medications. Your husband has hypertension, good to know. Now, regarding your family history, are there any conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother had some issues with her thyroid, I believe. She was always tired, and she took medication for it. But she passed away several years ago, so I don’t recall the specifics. My father had heart disease, yes. He had a stroke when he was in his seventies. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. But beyond that… I don’t believe so. It’s difficult to say for certain, as we weren’t very close as a family, and medical records weren’t as readily available back then. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Knowing what you do is helpful. Thyroid issues and a family history of both heart disease and diabetes are important pieces of the puzzle. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I walk for about an hour every day. I live with my husband in a rural area, so we don't have much in the way of social activities, if I'm honest. We enjoy gardening, and I spend a good deal of time cooking. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I work as an orderly at the local clinic, so I’m on my feet a fair amount. It’s not strenuous work, but it keeps me moving. And, I suppose, I’m under a fair amount of stress, being responsible for others' wellbeing. It's a simple life, but a busy one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an active lifestyle with daily walking, no smoking or heavy alcohol use, and a job that keeps you on your feet. You mentioned some stress at work. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's nothing dramatic, Doctor. But it’s a small clinic, and we’re often understaffed. So, I’m responsible for a lot – assisting patients, cleaning rooms, helping the nurses… I worry about making mistakes, about not providing the best possible care. It’s a weight on my mind, if that makes sense. And the patients… some of them are quite ill, and it’s difficult to see them suffer. It’s a caring profession, but it takes its toll. I don't dwell on it, but it's always there, in the background. Perhaps I’m simply being overly sensitive.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t sound like simply being overly sensitive, Ms. Selbitschka. It sounds like a demanding job with a lot of responsibility, and it’s perfectly normal to feel stressed in that situation. Alright. Now, to help me understand the situation better, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be fine. I understand that's necessary. Please, proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds detected. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no nodules or tenderness. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t detect any masses or organomegaly. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'll check your feet for swelling. No edema is present. Everything appears within normal limits, though the slightly enlarged thyroid warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: An enlarged thyroid… that’s concerning. My mother’s issues, perhaps? So, what do you recommend, Doctor? Do we need further tests? Bloodwork, perhaps? I'm prepared to do whatever is necessary to figure out what's going on. This unexplained weight gain is very unsettling, and I would like to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be proactive, Ms. Selbitschka. Given your symptoms and the slightly enlarged thyroid, I do recommend some further testing. I’d like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and thyroid function tests – specifically TSH, T4, and T3. These will give us a better understanding of your overall health and whether your thyroid is functioning properly. We’ll also check your lipid panel, as unexplained weight gain can sometimes be linked to cholesterol issues. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample as well?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. A urine sample is no trouble at all. And… how long will it take to get the results? I understand these things take time, but I am rather anxious to know what’s going on. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary changes, perhaps? Or should I continue with my usual routine?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to process the results, so we should have them back by next week. In the meantime, I wouldn’t recommend making any significant changes to your diet or exercise routine. Let’s get a baseline understanding of your current health status before we adjust anything. Continue with your usual habits, and try not to stress too much – I know that’s easier said than done, but stress can sometimes exacerbate these types of symptoms. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Next week is fine. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and for ordering the tests. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. And… is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Paperwork, perhaps? Or should I simply wait for a call to schedule the follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: No, nothing further at the moment, Ms. Selbitschka. Our receptionist will be in touch within the next day or two to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as significant fatigue, shortness of breath, or chest pain – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. I’m glad I could help, and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. Have a good day, and please try to relax.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Seil. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I will certainly contact the clinic if anything changes. And… I will try to relax, though that may be easier said than done. Have a good day as well, Doctor.
