DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Stilaire. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Stilaire, is it? Well, honestly, I don’t rightly remember why I’m here. My daughter, Simone, scheduled it. She’s always fussing over me, says I need “looking after.” Something about not wanting… things done. I don’t recall exactly. It's probably nothing serious, I've had feet all my life.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s very common to feel that way, especially with multiple appointments. Simone sounds like a very caring daughter. Perhaps we can work together to figure out what prompted the visit. Do you recall any specific concerns Simone mentioned when she scheduled this appointment?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm. She kept going on about some… procedure. Said it was “preventative” and that I was being “stubborn.” Honestly, that girl. Always trying to tell me what’s best. I told her I felt fine! Perfectly fine, considering my age. I've seen doctors try to push things I didn’t need before. I'm a podiatrist myself, you know. I know a thing or two about feet.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Gunasekara! A podiatrist, that's very helpful for me to know. It sounds like you have a good understanding of foot health, and I respect your experience. To clarify, Simone mentioned a specific procedure you were hesitant about?
PATIENT: Hesitant? Oh, she made it sound like I was refusing life-saving surgery! It was something about… cutting. Cutting on my toes, I think. Or maybe scraping? Honestly, it all blurs together. She kept talking about this new… technology? Some fancy machine. I told her I prefer things the old-fashioned way. And frankly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. My toes are perfectly functional. A little crooked maybe, but functional!
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like this procedure is something Simone feels strongly about, but you have reservations. To help me understand better – and to ensure we're on the same page – could you describe what you’ve been experiencing with your toes?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Well, nothing, really! That's the whole point! They feel fine. A little ache sometimes, after a long day, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? I’ve walked a lot in my life. Simone keeps saying something about… circulation? And how the toes aren't looking their best? Honestly, she worries too much. I've seen feet in worse shape, believe me. Podiatry isn't all pretty pedicures, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Gunasekara. It sounds like you’re not experiencing significant pain, and you’re concerned about Simone’s focus on aesthetics and potential circulation issues. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in the color or texture of your toes?
PATIENT: Color? Oh, goodness. I haven’t given them a proper look in ages. They’re…toe-colored, I suppose. Maybe a little paler than they used to be, now that you mention it. But that could be anything, couldn't it? Texture…well, they’re a little rough, I guess. Being my age. I don’t spend all day preening them like some of my former patients! Simone is always pointing out imperfections. A tiny callus here, a slight discoloration there…it's exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s helpful to have that information. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. But don’t go poking and prodding too much. I've seen what some doctors do. And honestly, I don’t need a lecture on proper foot care. I am a podiatrist, you know. Just be gentle, dear. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. As I suspected, the pulses in your feet are a bit weak. And I do notice some mild discoloration and thickening of the toenails. They don’t appear infected, but there is some evidence of reduced circulation. The skin also feels slightly cool to the touch. This could be indicative of peripheral artery disease, which is common in individuals as we age. It can sometimes lead to decreased blood flow to the feet, causing these symptoms. It’s important to address this to prevent further complications.
PATIENT: Peripheral…what now? Oh, dear. That sounds dreadful. Is that…serious? Simone didn’t mention anything about arteries. She just said I needed some…procedure. Is that what this is about? Cutting and scraping to fix my arteries? Honestly, I knew I shouldn't have come. I told her it was just old age. I don't like the sound of this one bit. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a good foot soak? I used to recommend warm water and Epsom salts to all my patients.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel concerned, Ms. Gunasekara. Peripheral artery disease isn’t necessarily dreadful, but it is important to address. It simply means there’s some narrowing of the arteries reducing blood flow to your feet. And no, Simone didn’t mention anything specifically about arteries – she focused on the potential procedure. A warm foot soak with Epsom salts is a good idea for comfort, but it won’t address the underlying issue. The procedure Simone is referring to is likely a non-invasive angiogram to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet, followed by potential angioplasty and stenting to open up any blockages in the arteries. It’s a fairly common procedure, and can significantly improve circulation and prevent further complications. However, before we consider any procedures, I'd like to order some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Oh, dear. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite overwhelmed. I just wanted a simple check-up, not a… a full-blown investigation! I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. But please, no cutting or scraping. And no fancy machines. I really don’t like machines. Are these tests painful? And how long will they take? Simone will be furious if I’m stuck in a doctor's office all day. I wish I had just stayed home with a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Gunasekara. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, and I assure you, we will take things at your pace. The tests I’m recommending are a simple Ankle-Brachial Index , which measures the blood pressure in your ankles and arms to compare blood flow, and a Doppler ultrasound to visualize the arteries in your legs and feet. The ABI is completely painless and takes just a few minutes. The Doppler ultrasound is also painless, although it may involve applying a cool gel to your legs. It takes about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule these tests at our outpatient imaging center, and they shouldn't interfere with your daily routine. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those for you?
PATIENT: Outpatient… imaging center? Oh, goodness. So many places. I just want to go home. But… alright. If it’s just a few minutes and no poking or prodding… and no machines making funny noises… I suppose you can schedule them. But please, make sure they’re as quick as possible. And no surprises! I really can’t handle surprises. And tell Simone… tell her I’m doing this for her, okay? Don’t want her fussing. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Gunasekara. I’ll make sure the appointments are scheduled as quickly as possible, and I’ll personally explain the process to you beforehand to minimize any surprises. We’ll also do everything we can to keep the appointments brief and comfortable. I’ll have my assistant schedule those for you now. And don’t worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s enough for today. Honestly, my head is swimming. Just… please, no more talk of machines or cutting. And thank your assistant for me. I think I just need a nice cup of tea. .
