DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I’m using the machine every night for the sleep apnea… it just doesn’t seem to be doing the trick like it used to. I’m tired all day, and it's starting to get in the way of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, daytime sleepiness despite consistent CPAP use. That’s good information to start with. It sounds frustrating. Just to clarify, when you say "doesn't seem to be doing the trick like it used to," how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it’s been… maybe three, four months now? It started gradually, I suppose. At first, it was just feeling a little more sluggish in the afternoons. Now, it’s pretty much all day. I try to take a little siesta, you know, like we used to do back home, but even that doesn’t always help. It’s… not a good feeling. I used to have so much energy.
DOCTOR: Three to four months of gradually worsening daytime sleepiness… I understand. It's definitely concerning when your energy levels change like that. And it’s good you’ve been trying to rest. Before we get too far, let’s go through some general questions, if you don't mind. This will help me get a better picture of what might be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Ask away. Weight… hmm. I think I’ve put on a few pounds, maybe five or six? It’s hard to say exactly, I don't weigh myself every day. The pandemic didn’t help, you know? Less walking, more cooking… and I do enjoy a good Spanish meal! But nothing drastic, I don’t think. Why do you ask? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Weight changes can sometimes contribute to sleep issues, or be a symptom of something else going on. And yes, the pandemic certainly changed routines for many of us. Now, besides the weight gain and sleepiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Well, my wife used to say I snored like a freight train, but she’s… not here anymore. The machine definitely helps with that, though. Besides that… I get headaches sometimes, especially in the mornings. Not terrible, just… a dull ache. And I’ve been a bit more forgetful lately, though at my age, who isn’t? But no, nothing major. Just little things, you know?
DOCTOR: Headaches in the morning and increased forgetfulness… I appreciate you sharing all of that, Mr. Paske. It is good to be thorough. And yes, things change as we get older, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides anything for the sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… Well, I take a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Nothing else regularly. Just those two, as needed. Do you need to know the dosages? I think I have the bottles somewhere…
DOCTOR: No need to search for the bottles right now, Mr. Paske. That’s helpful enough to know what you’re taking. We can always get the specifics later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… No, not really. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s about it. Nothing serious, nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything like that. I can eat anything, thankfully. Spanish food is very diverse, you know! It would be a shame to have allergies, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indeed! Spanish food is wonderful – and it would be a shame to have restrictions! Okay, last few questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides the sleep apnea and high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, years ago, back in my thirties, I had pneumonia. But that was a long time ago, and I recovered fully. And the doctor said I had a bit of arthritis, which is why my joints sometimes ache. Nothing else major, I don’t think. I've been generally healthy, considering my age. I always ate a good diet, you know. Lots of olive oil and fresh vegetables. Oh! And I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, but that doesn't really count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, removing your appendix doesn’t really count as a current medical condition. Pneumonia and arthritis - good to know. Now, has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings – had any significant medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father, he had heart trouble towards the end of his life. He smoked a lot, you see. And my mother, she had diabetes. Not the best genes, I suppose. My sister, she’s healthy as a horse, though. Always has been. So, it’s a bit of a mix. Heart disease and diabetes on my side of the family, mostly. Nothing else that I can think of right now. Is that important? Should I be worried about those things?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know your family history, Mr. Paske, and yes, a history of heart disease and diabetes does warrant a bit of extra attention. It doesn’t mean you will develop those conditions, but it’s good to be aware and proactive. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Hmm. What do you mean? I used to be a professor, at the university. Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies. A lot of reading, a lot of thinking. Now I'm retired. I live alone. My wife passed away a few years ago, sadly. I don’t have any children. I enjoy reading, watching the news, and taking little walks when the weather is nice. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts, Mr. Paske. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s important to have a complete picture. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. Now, have you ever smoked, or do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I used to smoke, back in my younger days, when it was fashionable, I suppose. But I quit a long time ago. Maybe thirty years now? I don't even remember exactly. And I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but not anymore. My stomach doesn’t agree with it. So, no smoking, no alcohol currently. I’m pretty good about avoiding unhealthy habits. I try to, anyway. Old habits die hard, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Paske. And congratulations on quitting smoking—that's a huge accomplishment. Okay, that gives me a good foundation. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a patient man, you know. Let’s get this over with, so we can figure out what’s going on with this sleepiness.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 76 and regular. Lungs sound clear, good air movement on both sides. Ears look clear as well. Throat looks a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, can you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… Is that alright? My throat does feel a bit scratchy, like you said. Probably just the dry air. It’s been so hot lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, a little bit of redness, and some dryness. Your uvula looks normal. No swollen lymph nodes. Chest sounds resonant. Okay. Everything sounds and looks within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure and dryness of your throat are worth noting. And given your history of sleepiness despite CPAP use, I think we should run a few tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to figure out what’s going on. Tests are fine. The more information, the better, right? What kind of tests are we talking about? Blood work? Anything else? I just want to feel like myself again. This tiredness is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exactly, the more information the better. I'd like to start with a complete blood count – that checks for anemia and other blood disorders. I also want to check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can cause fatigue and sleepiness. A basic metabolic panel will check your kidney and liver function, and we’ll also check your vitamin D levels. Sometimes, a deficiency can cause fatigue. And because of the sleepiness, even with CPAP, I’d also like to repeat a sleep study, just to rule out any changes in your sleep apnea and see if the machine settings still optimal. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. All of it. All the tests. I'm happy to do whatever it takes. Sleep study again? Okay. It was a bit uncomfortable, but if it helps… then it’s worth it. I'm just glad we're finally getting somewhere. When can we schedule these tests? And do I need to do anything to prepare for them? Should I stop taking my blood pressure medication or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you're comfortable with that. No, please do not stop taking your blood pressure medication. Continue it as prescribed. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at the lab just down the street. It's a fasting test, so you'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight, except for water. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, arrange the sleep study for next week, and she will give you specific instructions on how to prepare. It's best to call the sleep lab to make sure your insurance covers the study. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe a mild throat lozenge to help with the dryness. It shouldn’t interact with any of your medications. And I want you to keep a sleep diary for the next week, just to track your sleep patterns and how you're feeling during the day. Do you think you can do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can definitely do that. A sleep diary is easy enough. And thank you for the throat lozenge. That sounds nice. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing we're taking action. I appreciate your patience and understanding. When should I expect to hear back with the test results? And is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, besides the diary and lozenges? Maybe avoiding caffeine?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. That’s what I’m here for. The blood work results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Once I have those, I’ll give you a call. The sleep study results will take a little longer, maybe a week or so, as they need to be interpreted by a sleep specialist. In the meantime, yes, avoiding caffeine is a good idea, especially in the afternoon and evening. And make sure you’re staying well-hydrated. Try to get some gentle exercise if you’re able, and try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on the weekends. I’m also going to write up a referral for a cardiologist, just as a precaution, given your family history. It’s always good to get a baseline assessment, even if everything turns out to be normal. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… okay. That sounds sensible, I suppose. Being proactive is always a good thing. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve covered everything so thoroughly. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I’ll call Maria to schedule the sleep study and make sure the insurance is taken care of. And I’ll start the sleep diary tonight. I hope we can figure this out soon. I miss feeling energetic again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. And I certainly hope so too. We’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. Maria is excellent; she’ll take good care of you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Here’s the prescription for the throat lozenge, and the referral for the cardiologist. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
