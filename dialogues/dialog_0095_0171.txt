DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's… my nails, I think? They just… look funny. Not good funny. I don't really remember how they started, just that they don't look right. They’re kinda… discolored. Yeah, discolored. Is that what you call it?
DOCTOR: Discolored, okay. And how long have you noticed this discoloration, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… it gets away from me. A while. Maybe a few months? I don't really keep track. It’s not like it happened overnight, you know? It just… gradually got worse. I don't know. A long time, probably. Does that help?
DOCTOR: A few months, gradually worsening. Alright. And is it all of your nails, or just some?
PATIENT: Um… all of 'em, I think. Or maybe most. They all look kinda bad. Not shiny like they used to be. More… dull. And kinda thick, maybe? I don’t look at my hands much, to be honest. I use ‘em for work, but… not for admiring.
DOCTOR: Dull and thickened… okay. Do you have any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. They don't hurt hurt. Maybe a little… sensitive? If I bump 'em or something. But not like a real pain. Just… annoying, I guess. I mostly just don't like how they look. They don't feel good either, kinda rough.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you notice any changes to the skin around your nails?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me see… …I don’t know. Redness? Maybe a little? It's hard to tell, I have… well, I work with ears all day, you know? My hands are always busy. I don't pay attention to the skin so much. It's probably fine. I don't get cuts or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other symptoms that you've noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other than bad nails? Um… no, not really. I feel alright. Tired, sometimes, but everyone's tired, right? Nothing special. I mean, I don't have a fever or anything. Or a cough. Or… anything like that. Just the nails. I don't think I'm sick, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better picture of things, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that's a long time ago. I go to the doctor when I need to, not just to list things. Let me think… I had something with my… gallbladder, maybe? A long time ago. They took it out. And… uh… I don't know. Nothing major, I don’t think. I get Medicare, you know, they’d tell me if I had something serious.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removed, okay. And any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: Um… no, not that I remember. Maybe when I was a kid? Like, tonsils or something? I don't really recall. Honestly, Doctor, I don't spend a lot of time thinking about operations. I just want my nails to look normal again. It’s kinda embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, this one. For my… pressure. The doctor gave it to me a while back. Just one a day. That's it. Nothing else. I don't like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. I don’t think so. I eat pretty much anything. I might have gotten a rash once, but I don’t remember what from. Probably just a bug bite or something. I don’t have any bad allergies, you know? Like, can’t breathe or anything. Just normal stuff. I’m pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut. Now, I’m going to take a closer look at your nails. Can you hold your hands still for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Still as a rock, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m just hoping you can fix ‘em. They look so… sad.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noticing some thickening and discoloration, as you mentioned. The texture is also quite rough. There’s a slight pitting on several nails, and the nail beds themselves appear somewhat ridged. No significant redness or inflammation around the nail folds. It doesn't appear to be infected, but the changes are fairly pronounced. I'm going to order a fungal culture to rule out a nail infection. It's the most likely cause, given the appearance.
PATIENT: A… fungal culture? What does that involve? Is it painful? And what if it is a fungus? Will I lose my nails? I need my hands for work, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. We'll take a small clipping from a few of your nails and send it to the lab. They'll identify if any fungus is present. And no, you won’t lose your nails. If it is a fungus, treatment usually involves a topical medication, possibly an oral one if it’s severe. It can take several months to see improvement, but it’s generally very effective. We’ll discuss the best course of action once we have the results. I'll also send you to a dermatologist for a second opinion. They specialize in skin and nail conditions and can provide further guidance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Oh dear. More doctors… I just want this to be over with, you know? A long time, you said? Months? Well, I guess there’s no avoiding it if that's what it takes. Topical… like a cream? That sounds okay. Better than losing my nails, anyway. Okay, do what you think is best, Doctor. Just… hurry, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering the fungal culture now, and I’ll have my nurse schedule you an appointment with a dermatologist. It may take a few days to get the appointment booked. In the meantime, try to keep your nails dry and clean, and avoid wearing nail polish. It can worsen the condition. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think you explained everything pretty clearly. Keep 'em dry… no polish… Wait, how long will it take to get the results? I have a client appointment next week, and I don’t want to have to explain… this. Will it be a long time? And can I still work?
DOCTOR: The results typically take 2-3 weeks to come back, unfortunately. And yes, you should be able to continue working as usual. The condition isn't contagious, and it shouldn't interfere with your ability to do your job. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the results, and if medication is required, we’ll make sure it doesn’t affect your work schedule. I’ll also write a note for your client just in case, explaining that you’re being evaluated for a nail condition and it's not contagious. Does that sound satisfactory?
PATIENT: A note… that's good, that's really good. I appreciate that. Two weeks… okay, I can manage two weeks. I just don't want to worry my client. They're a bit… particular. Alright, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you for explaining everything so… thoroughly. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Thut. We'll get this sorted out. My nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Have a good day.
