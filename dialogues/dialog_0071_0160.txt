DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… weakness. And this awful habit. I just… I need to get it sorted. It's embarrassing, really. I haven't felt right for months, and now… well, now I’m chewing on dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It’s not like I want to.
DOCTOR: Oh dear, that does sound distressing. Weakness and… the dirt-chewing… right. No judgment at all, Candis. These things happen. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. When did this weakness start?
PATIENT: Months ago, like I said. Maybe… six, seven months? It started gradual, just feeling tired at the end of the day, you know? I thought it was just getting old. I’m 79, it happens. But it’s gotten worse. Now it's all day. And the dirt… that started maybe a month ago. It just…appeals. Don’t ask me why. It’s awful. And it makes my stomach upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, six or seven months for the weakness, and more recently the… urge to eat dirt. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Is the weakness all over, or is it worse in certain parts of your body?
PATIENT: It's… everywhere, I suppose. But my legs are the worst. Feel like lead weights, sometimes. It’s like trying to walk through mud. I used to be so active, always gardening. Can't do much of that anymore. And my arms get tired easily. Lifting things, even just groceries... it's a struggle. Honestly, it's humiliating.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs are particularly affected, making gardening difficult. And it's impacting your ability to lift things. Humiliating or not, you're doing the right thing by coming in. Now, thinking about other things… have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite's been… off. Not much hunger, really. And yes, I've lost weight. My clothes feel looser, which… well, I haven’t weighed myself exactly, but I know I’m thinner. People have commented on it. I just… haven’t been eating much of anything. Everything seems tasteless, too. Like there's no point. I used to love cooking. Now it’s just a chore.
DOCTOR: Okay, reduced appetite, weight loss, and loss of taste… those are all important things to note. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No, I can swallow fine. Never had any problems with that. It’s just… I don't want to. It's not a physical problem, it's… a lack of enjoyment, I guess. Everything just tastes like cardboard. Even my favorite things. And this whole dirt thing… That doesn’t taste good either, just… it’s a craving. A stupid craving! I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No difficulty swallowing. Just a loss of taste and, as you said, this unusual craving. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My skin feels dry, really dry. And I get cold easily. Even when it's warm outside. I used to have a good glow, you know? Now I just look… washed out. Oh, and I've been more… irritable, I suppose. Snapping at people, which isn’t like me. My daughter said I’ve been impossible to live with. She's dramatic. But… she's not entirely wrong.
DOCTOR: Dry skin, feeling cold, irritability… Okay. Now, this might be a bit personal, but have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Really? You're asking me that? Look, I came here because I’m eating dirt, not to discuss… that. I suppose… they’ve been… different. A bit looser than usual. And not as often. I haven't… paid much attention, to be honest. Is that relevant? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Candis, and I apologize if that was a bit intrusive. It's relevant because these symptoms – the weakness, weight loss, taste changes, dry skin, craving for dirt, and altered bowel habits – could point to several possibilities, and we need to consider everything. The dirt-eating specifically – a condition called pica – can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. I’m just trying to piece things together. Now, before we go any further, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Pica, you say? So I’m… ill? Great. Wonderful. No, I don't have any allergies. Never had any problems with medications. Though I don't take much, honestly. Just a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that’s all. Look, can we just figure out what’s wrong and get me some help? This whole conversation is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. I think it's time we did a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests. The blood tests will help us rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes. Just… get on with it. I have things to do, you know? Gardening… well, used to have gardening to do. This is taking up my whole day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure, pulse and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Afterwards, I'll check your reflexes, and look at your hands and feet. Let's begin. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, but nothing alarming.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I don't like doctors. Never have. All poking and prodding…
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds a bit… faint, and your breathing is a little shallow. Nothing remarkable in your throat. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little sluggish. Now, let me take a look at your hands and feet. Your skin is dry and pale, as you mentioned. I also notice some slight swelling in your ankles. Is this new?
PATIENT: Stop! That’s enough poking. My ankles are always a little swollen. It’s the arthritis. Always has been. Look, can we just skip all this and get the blood tests done? I’m getting a headache now. And this whole thing is giving me the creeps.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can skip the rest of the exam for now. We'll proceed with the blood tests. I'll have my assistant draw a few vials. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin B12 and D levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it done. And hurry.
