DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – for the sleep apnea, you see – and it helps, it does. But I’m still awfully tired during the day. It's just… persistent. It makes doing things a bit difficult, you know? Especially with my classes starting up again soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Daytime sleepiness, despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea. I understand. And you mentioned classes… are you currently enrolled in any educational programs, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I teach. I'm a professor, actually. Area, Ethnic, and Cultural Studies, at the community college here. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it, but needing a nap in the middle of a lecture isn’t very professional, is it? I've been doing it for… well, a long time now. Started after I retired from the first job, really.
DOCTOR: No, that certainly wouldn’t be ideal. It’s good that you’re still so active, Mr. Paske. Teaching is demanding work. Now, could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up, Doctor. It's more… a heavy feeling. Like I haven't quite woken up, even after a full night’s sleep. And it’s all day, really, but worse in the afternoon. I find myself needing coffee, a lot of coffee, just to get through. And even then, it’s not a proper wakefulness, if you understand. It's… foggy. It makes concentrating difficult, too.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A persistent feeling of fatigue, despite adequate sleep, with a heaviness and difficulty concentrating. And you're relying on caffeine to manage it. How long has this been going on, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… well, even with the machine, it’s probably been six months or so. Before the machine, it was much worse, of course. But even now, after adjusting to the mask and everything… it hasn’t really gone away completely. I thought it would, you know? The doctor who prescribed it said it should make a big difference. And it has, don't get me wrong. But not enough, it seems.
DOCTOR: Six months, even with consistent CPAP use. And it’s not providing the expected relief. Do you happen to know what your AHI – Apnea-Hypopnea Index – was before you started the machine, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: AHI…? Oh dear. I’m afraid I don’t. They told me it was quite high, that’s all. Something about stopping breathing a lot during the night. I remember being told it was serious enough to need treatment, of course. They adjusted the machine settings a few times, making sure it was working properly, but I don’t recall any numbers. I mostly just focused on getting used to wearing the thing! Numbers aren't really my forte, you see. I'm a historian, not a technician.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Paske. No need to worry about the specifics. We can access that information from your records. Ah, here we are. Your initial AHI was 32. That is quite high, and it’s good you’re being treated for it. Your current AHI with the CPAP is… 4. That’s within a reasonable range. However, given your continued fatigue, we need to explore other possibilities. Now, besides the sleepiness and difficulty concentrating, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Glad to hear it’s something good, at least. Four sounds much better than thirty! As for other changes… hmm. Well, my wife and I divorced a few years back. That was… difficult, naturally. But that wasn't recent. Health-wise… I suppose I’ve been a little more forgetful lately. Nothing major, you understand. Just misplacing things, forgetting names occasionally. Old age, I presume. And my knees ache more, especially when the weather changes. But that's been going on for years, too. I don’t think that's relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: The divorce is certainly a significant life event, and those can have an impact on overall well-being. And the forgetfulness is worth noting, even if you attribute it to age. It's important to rule out other potential causes. Now, Mr. Paske, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I was on some medication for that for a while. I stopped taking it, though. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the side effects. Otherwise… no, nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. I walk every day, eat a reasonably good diet. My blood pressure is usually fine, as far as I know. They check it at the dentist, and it’s always been okay. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up completely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Yes. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils removed. And… and I had a hernia operation many years ago. That was… oh, goodness, probably forty years ago now. Nothing since then, thankfully. I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I avoid surgery if at all possible!
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the coffee, Doctor! Well, and sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they’re really bothering me – ibuprofen, I think it is. Nothing regularly, though. Just when I need it. Oh, and occasionally an antacid, if I eat something spicy. But that's about it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible, you see. I prefer to let nature take its course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I can recall. My wife, bless her heart, was the one with all the allergies. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it, she was allergic to it! But I've always been pretty fortunate in that regard. No, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Mr. Paske, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be wonderful. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. I'll listen to your heart and lungs as well. Then we'll take a look in your ears and throat. It's just a routine check-up, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I always get a little nervous around doctors, to be honest. Not that I don’t trust you, of course. It's just… old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Paske. Many people feel that way. We’ll take things slowly and gently. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes appear normal. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and a few simple neurological tests, if you don't mind. It's just to ensure everything is functioning properly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate. I do hope everything is functioning properly. It's just getting old, I suppose, but one does worry. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Knee reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Coordination is good. No signs of weakness or tremors. Sensation is intact. Everything appears normal neurologically as well. Now, one final thing. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There. Is that alright? I sometimes feel a little unsteady on my feet, but I suppose that's just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly slow and cautious, but stable. No significant abnormalities detected. Alright, Mr. Paske. Thank you for your cooperation. That completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. Now, let's discuss your symptoms and formulate a plan. You mentioned persistent daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine, and some recent forgetfulness. Given your age and the persistence of your symptoms, I think it's important to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or anemia. We should also consider a sleep study to reassess your CPAP settings and ensure it’s providing adequate treatment. What are your thoughts on that, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and another sleep study… yes, I think that's a good idea. I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? I just want to feel like myself again. This constant tiredness is… draining, to say the least. And the forgetfulness… well, it's a little worrying, naturally. So, blood tests and a sleep study. Yes, let’s do that. When can we schedule those? And will they be covered by Medicare? I do worry about the costs, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning at the clinic. They should only take about an hour, and we’ll get the results back within a few days. As for the sleep study, we can arrange that through the sleep center next week. And yes, both the blood tests and the sleep study should be covered by Medicare, as long as they are deemed medically necessary, which I believe they are in your case. Our billing department will verify everything beforehand, so you don’t have to worry about unexpected costs. Now, while we wait for the results, I’d like to recommend a few lifestyle adjustments. Ensuring you get adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular exercise can significantly improve your overall well-being. Also, reducing stress and staying socially active can help combat fatigue and forgetfulness. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests tomorrow and a sleep study next week… and the lifestyle adjustments. Yes, I can certainly try to do all of that. I do enjoy walking, and I try to eat a healthy diet, although I do have a sweet tooth, I confess. And thank you for mentioning the social activity. I do miss my wife, naturally, and sometimes I feel a little lonely. Perhaps I should join one of those senior groups. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for your time and your help, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re a team in this. We’ll work together to get you feeling your best. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Our nurses are always available to assist you. Here’s a copy of the lab requisition form and the information about the sleep center. Please call to schedule your sleep study at your convenience. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I appreciate your patience and your thoroughness. I feel much more hopeful now. I believe I’ll head home now and try to get a good night’s sleep – perhaps with a little less coffee. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. It was a pleasure meeting you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you too. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day, and get some rest.
PATIENT: .
