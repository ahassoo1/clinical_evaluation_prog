DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won’t heal. I’ve had these…problems…with the sugar in my blood for years, you see. It's just…aggravating.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that isn’t healing, and you’ve had some trouble with your blood sugar for a while. I understand. That definitely needs checking out. Could you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just a little more. It’s been months! Months, I tell you. It started as a tiny thing, barely noticeable, on the top of my foot. Now…now it’s quite deep. And it smells. Not pleasant, at all. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, of course, but it just…seems to get worse. I put some ointment on it, the kind my daughter brought back from Honolulu, but that didn’t help either. Honestly, I suspect that stuff was just fancy lotion.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And it’s deep, smells, and hasn’t responded to ointment. That does sound concerning. And you mentioned your daughter brought the ointment from Honolulu...do you remember what it was called, or what she said it was for?
PATIENT: Oh, that girl…always trying new things. Let me think…it was in a little blue jar. Some sort of…aloe vera, I believe. She said it was good for everything! Burns, cuts, rashes…you name it. “Natural healing,” she called it. Honestly, I think she gets these ideas from the internet. It smelled very nice, though. Didn't do anything, but smelled nice. Waste of money, if you ask me. Real medicine is what you need, not fancy creams.
DOCTOR: Okay, an aloe vera cream from Honolulu that didn’t help. I appreciate you telling me that. Now, you mentioned trouble with your blood sugar. Are you currently taking any medication for diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes…yes. I take a pill. A little white one. Every morning. Can’t remember the name, honestly. They change them so often! My doctor back on Majuro…well, he retired. The new one just keeps writing prescriptions. I just ask the pharmacist to fill it. It’s supposed to keep the sugar down, but it doesn’t always seem to, does it? That's why I have this foot trouble, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be confusing when medications change, and it sounds like you’ve had some changes in doctors too. It's good you're working with a pharmacist to keep things straight. And yes, uncontrolled blood sugar can absolutely contribute to foot problems. Now, besides the pill, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind. There’s a little red pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take something… Ibuprofen, I think it is. Just when I really need it. And…oh! My daughter also gave me some of those fish oil capsules. She said it was good for my heart. I try to remember to take them, but sometimes I forget. Honestly, it's a whole cabinet full of pills. A nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a red pill for blood pressure, ibuprofen when needed for joint pain, and fish oil capsules. That's helpful to know. Now, thinking about your overall health…have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? I had my gallbladder out years ago. Back in the 70s, it was. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a stool. A silly accident. And…oh, I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they put a little thing in my leg and seemed to fix it. A stent, they called it. And I've had the usual things, you know, colds, the flu, arthritis…nothing major. I’m an old woman, dear. Things wear out.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal in the 70s, a broken wrist, a stent placed for a heart issue, and arthritis. That gives me a good picture. Now, have any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – had similar health problems, like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother, she had the sugar trouble too. Badly. She lost a leg, poor woman. And my brother, he had a heart attack when he was still young. A terrible thing. And my daughter…well, she’s always complaining about her joints. Seems to run in the family, this sort of thing. Weak bones, weak hearts… it’s not surprising, really. We don’t eat like we used to, you know. All this processed food.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s very helpful to know. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost. I don’t care much for okra. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I’ve never been stung, so that’s not a concern. I think I'm a pretty tough old bird, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Okay, now, I’m going to take a look at your foot. Could you please take off your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just be gentle, dear. It’s quite sensitive. And it smells, you know. I apologize for that. There. As you can see, it's not pretty.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It is quite deep, and there’s some redness and swelling around it. Does this hurt a lot when I touch it like this?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that stings. Quite a bit, actually. It’s a throbbing pain, most of the time. And it feels…warm. Not a good warm, if you know what I mean. Like there’s something…going on underneath. It’s been like this for weeks now, just getting worse and worse. Honestly, I'm worried it's going to get infected. My mother’s leg…well, that started like this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned. The area is warm to the touch, and there's some discharge. Your pulses are present, which is good, but they are a little weak. It does look infected. We need to take some steps to address this quickly. I’m going to order some blood tests to check for signs of infection and also a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the problem. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, you know. But if it will help…yes. Just be quick about it. And please tell me what all this means. I don't understand all the medical jargon. Is it serious? Is it like my mother's leg?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood tests will help us see if the infection is spreading, and the wound culture will tell us exactly what kind of bacteria we’re dealing with so we can choose the right antibiotic. It’s not necessarily like your mother’s leg just yet, but it is serious enough that we need to address it promptly. We’ll take some X-rays of your foot as well, just to make sure there’s no infection in the bone. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood, and then we'll get some X-rays done. After we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-rays…more tests. Oh, alright. I suppose I have no choice, do I? Just…be gentle, dear. And tell me what you find. I want to know everything. And what about antibiotics? Will those help? I’ve heard good things about antibiotics. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do everything we can to get this under control quickly. Antibiotics are a very good first step, and we will absolutely start you on an antibiotic once we have a better idea of what we’re dealing with. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The X-rays are quick and painless. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to clean and dress the wound to keep it protected. I’ll explain everything as we go, and please don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have. We’re a team in this, Louine. Do you have any questions for me right now before we get started?
PATIENT: Team…well, that’s nice of you to say. I suppose I just worry. My mother…it took a long time for them to figure out what was wrong. And by then…it was too late. Will this require surgery? I don't want surgery. I’ve heard terrible things about surgery. And how long will it take to heal? I have a granddaughter’s wedding next year…I must be able to go.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, and I want to address them honestly. Surgery is not necessarily required at this time. We'll start with antibiotics, wound care, and close monitoring. We'll see how you respond to that first. If the infection doesn’t improve with conservative treatment, we may need to consider other options, but that's something we’ll discuss if it becomes necessary. As for the wedding, that’s a wonderful goal to work towards. Healing time depends on several factors, including how quickly your body responds to treatment and how well we can control the infection. We’ll do everything possible to get you there. We’ll need to keep a very close eye on your blood sugar levels as well, as that plays a big role in healing. Right now, let’s focus on getting the infection under control. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll let you know as soon as we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood tests first. And keep the sugar down, you said. My daughter is always nagging me about that, too. Just…be careful, dear. It’s quite tender. And thank you. For explaining everything. It helps to know what’s going on. I appreciate it. Now, what do I do about my shoe? Can I walk on it? Or should I stay off it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s important to me that you feel informed and comfortable. For now, I recommend staying off of it as much as possible. Walking on it could worsen the infection and delay healing. I'm going to provide you with a pair of crutches, and the nurse will show you how to use them safely. We’ll also get you a special boot to protect the wound and keep pressure off of it once we've finished dressing it. Once I finish dressing it, I’ll explain the aftercare instructions in detail. It’s important to keep the wound clean and dry, and to change the dressing regularly. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to monitor your progress. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Crutches…oh, dear. I haven’t used crutches since I was a girl! And a special boot? This is all rather…overwhelming. What if it doesn’t heal? What if it gets worse? And what about the wedding? I promised my granddaughter I would be there…I must be able to dance with her. Is there anything else I should be doing? Vitamins? Special creams? Anything at all? I just want to be sure…I don’t want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’re going to do everything we can to prevent that from happening. We’ll take it one step at a time. Regarding crutches, the nurse will show you how to use them safely and effectively. It may take some practice, but you’ll get the hang of it. As for vitamins and special creams, it’s best to avoid those for now. We want to focus on the basics: antibiotics, wound care, and controlling your blood sugar. Using too many different products could actually worsen the infection. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and we’ll adjust the treatment plan as needed. As for the wedding, let’s focus on getting you healthy and strong. We’ll do everything possible to get you back on your feet in time to dance with your granddaughter. Right now, let’s focus on getting the antibiotics started and keeping the wound clean and dry. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we'll get you set up with the crutches and the special boot. Do you have any questions before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: Alright. Antibiotics and keep it clean. That sounds…manageable. And the crutches…I suppose I'll have to learn. I just…I don’t want to be a burden. My daughter is always so busy…and I don’t want to cause trouble for anyone. Will she have to take time off work to help me? I don’t want her to worry about me. She has her own life…her own responsibilities.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Louine. And your daughter clearly cares about you very much. It's natural for her to want to help, and it sounds like she's already doing so. As for taking time off work, that’s something you and your daughter will need to discuss. However, we can certainly work with you to minimize any disruption to her schedule. We can schedule follow-up appointments at times that are convenient for both of you, and we can provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for your wound at home so she doesn’t have to worry about it constantly. We also have resources available to help you with transportation and other support services, if you need them. We want to make this as easy as possible for both of you. Right now, let’s focus on getting you set up with the antibiotics and the crutches. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we'll get you started. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s all for now. Just…thank you. For explaining everything so clearly. And for being so kind. I suppose I'm ready for the blood tests. As long as they don't take too much. And don't tell my daughter I'm worried. She'll fuss too much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. It’s my pleasure. And I promise, we’ll take good care of you. And don’t worry, I won’t tell your daughter you’re worried. Your secret is safe with me. The nurse should be here any moment now. She’s very skilled, and she’ll make the blood tests as quick and painless as possible. Just relax, and let her do her job. And remember, we’re here for you every step of the way. Now, let's get those tests done.
