DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning. It's about getting a card... a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or a taxi. I need that to keep doing that work. It's the law now, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the regulations are becoming… extensive. You're referring to the Commercial Driver’s Medical Certificate, or CDL. Though, for ride-sharing, a standard driver's license may suffice depending on your state and the company’s requirements. Regardless, we need to assess your overall health to determine if you’re fit to drive at all, commercially or otherwise. So, let's start with why you think you need this certificate. Any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. CDL... right. See, I just want to be sure I'm doing everything correctly. The company I drive for mentioned something about needing a better card than just my regular license. I don't really understand all the rules. Concerns? No, not really. I feel fine! I’ve been driving for years. Logging trucks mostly, before this. But I'm 70, so I guess they want to check me out extra careful. Makes sense. I just want to get this done so I can keep working.
DOCTOR: "Feel fine" is… not a diagnosis, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Logging trucks, you say?
PATIENT: I know, I know. Sorry. Old habits, I suppose. I just mean I haven’t had any trouble driving. No accidents, no tickets… nothing like that. Just want to be clear – I'm not trying to rush you or anything. I understand you need to do your job properly. Logging was hard work, though. Very different from driving people around now. Much more sitting!
DOCTOR: Sitting… right. Well, prolonged sitting can contribute to a variety of issues. Let's go through a quick medical history. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Dr. Tanaka, my primary care doctor, a couple of times this year for my annual check-up and a little cough I had in February. Nothing serious. He’s good, very thorough. And I had my eyes checked last fall, just a routine thing. Everything was fine then. Oh! And a dentist, of course. Six months ago. Standard cleaning. I try to keep up with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let's see… Just a low-dose aspirin, every day, for my heart. Dr. Tanaka suggested it, years ago. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But not regularly. Maybe a couple of times a month, if that. And… oh! Occasionally, a little something for sleep if I'm really restless. Melatonin, I think it’s called. But very rarely.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, in my knees and hips, mostly. It's just part of getting old, I suppose. It doesn't bother me too much, usually. A little stiff in the mornings, that’s all. Nothing that stops me from doing things. I can get around just fine. I just… I don’t jump around like I used to! It doesn't affect my driving, though. Honestly.
DOCTOR: And have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well controlled with diet and exercise for years now. Dr. Tanaka keeps a close eye on it. And… oh! A gallstone, many years ago. They took it out, no problems since. Nothing else that I can think of. Really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I try to take care of myself. Is that enough detail? I can give you specifics if you need dates and doctors' names. I have everything written down at home.
DOCTOR: Any family history of heart disease, stroke, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My father had a heart attack when he was in his 70s. He smoked, you see. A lot. And my mother… she had some memory problems when she got older. They called it dementia, I think. It wasn’t a quick thing, it was gradual. On my husband’s side... his brother had a stroke, I believe, but I don't recall the specifics. We weren’t particularly close to his family, to be honest. Is that helpful? It’s been a long time, and I'm not the best at remembering things like that. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Alright. Let's do a brief physical exam. I'll need you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Just a simple assessment of your gait and balance. And then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I’m a little stiff, as I mentioned, so don't mind if I move a bit slowly. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I'm ready when you are. I just hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a ride-share scheduled for later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, walk slowly towards that wall, turn around, and come back. I’m observing your balance and coordination. And try to keep your arms relaxed. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta, please stop there. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Alright. Now, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Let me see… today is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of the date, especially since I started driving professionally. I need to remember appointments and such. Is that correct? Sometimes, I get a little confused, but I'm usually alright. What about the day of the week? Is that important? I believe it’s a Saturday. Is that right? I could check my phone, if you’d like. I have it right here. It’s just… sometimes my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It is August 2nd, 2025, and yes, it is Saturday. Alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Based on this preliminary assessment… and your history… I have some concerns. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your memory recall is… less than optimal. I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. And we need to get a baseline ECG to assess your heart health. We also need to review your medication list with Dr. Tanaka. Frankly, I’m not comfortable clearing you for commercial driving at this time. It’s a matter of patient safety and public safety.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I was hoping it wouldn’t come to this. I really need this job. I’m not sure what I’ll do if I can’t drive. A neurological evaluation… and an ECG… That sounds expensive. And time-consuming. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Any simpler tests? I don’t understand… I feel fine. I’ve been driving for years! I’m a careful driver. What about just a regular license? Would that be possible? I… I really don’t want to lose this job. It keeps me active, you know? And I need the money. Is it absolutely necessary to do all these tests? What happens if I don't do them?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarrotta, I understand your concerns. However, these tests are not optional. Commercial driving regulations require a thorough assessment of physical and cognitive function. It’s not about your personal feelings; it’s about meeting legal standards and ensuring you are fit to operate a vehicle safely. A regular driver’s license has different requirements, but given your age and the slight cognitive concerns I've observed, I strongly recommend getting a medical evaluation before resuming any driving, regardless of the license type. I will provide you with a referral to a neurologist and a cardiologist. I can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. And I can document my findings and recommendations to Dr. Tanaka, so we can coordinate your care. But I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for commercial driving until these evaluations are completed. It would be irresponsible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. Everything was fine yesterday. And the day before that. It’s… frightening, really. To think something might be changing. The referrals… can you give me those now? And the information about financial assistance? I need to… I need to think about this. And talk to Dr. Tanaka. He's always been good to me. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. The neurologist I recommend is Dr. Emily Carter, and the cardiologist is Dr. David Lee. Their contact information and addresses are on the slips. And here are some pamphlets on financial assistance programs for medical expenses. I’ll document my findings and fax them to Dr. Tanaka’s office. It’s best if you schedule an appointment with him as soon as possible to discuss these results. I wish you all the best, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions.
