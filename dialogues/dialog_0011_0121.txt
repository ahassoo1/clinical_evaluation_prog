DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: I see. Dry eyes, and it's been bothering you for some time. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Not sure how long, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to keep track these days. Feels like sand in 'em sometimes. Especially when the wind blows. I work outside, you see. Cement work. Lots of dust.
DOCTOR: I understand. Cement work certainly exposes your eyes to a lot of irritants. And it’s helpful to know it’s been a few weeks. Does the dryness feel constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Worse when I'm workin', for sure. When I'm inside, it's... better. Not good, just not as bad. Especially if it's damp out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to your work environment and seems to be alleviated somewhat by damp conditions. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes they feel kinda gritty. Like somethin' is in 'em, even when nothin' is. And... blurry sometimes. Not all the time, just now and then. Makes it hard to see straight when I'm mixin' cement. Not safe, that.
DOCTOR: I see. Grittiness and occasional blurry vision along with the dryness – that’s helpful information. Have you noticed any redness, discharge, or pain in or around your eyes?
PATIENT: No pain. Not really. A little red sometimes, maybe. Hard to tell with the sun. And... no, no nothin' comin' out of 'em. Just dry. Mostly just dry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to help with the dryness so far?
PATIENT: Nope. Never really bothered with nothin'. Thought it would just go away. Old man stuff, I figured. Didn't seem worth a trip to the doctor 'til it started makin' it hard to work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in now. Let's do a quick examination of your eyes. I'm going to check your vision, and then I'll take a closer look at the surface of your eyes with a special instrument. It doesn't hurt. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine. Just... get it over with quick, alright? Got work to get back to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I'll be as efficient as possible. Alright, Mr. Pipolo, your vision is a little reduced, but not significantly. And I can see some dryness and mild irritation on the surface of both eyes. There’s some evidence of punctate erosions – very small scratches on the cornea – which is consistent with chronic dryness and irritation from dust exposure. I also see some mild staining, which indicates some damage to the corneal epithelium. I'm noting all this in your chart. It appears you have a condition called keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye disease, exacerbated by your work environment.
PATIENT: Kerato… what-now? Look, doc, I just want somethin' to make 'em stop feelin' like sandpaper. Don't need fancy words. Can you help with that?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pipolo. “Keratoconjunctivitis sicca” is just the medical term for dry eyes. We can definitely address the dryness. I recommend starting with artificial tears – lubricating eye drops – four times a day, even if your eyes aren't feeling dry. These will help keep your eyes moist and reduce the irritation. I'm going to write you a prescription for a preservative-free brand, as those are gentler on the eyes with frequent use. Additionally, while working, I strongly advise wearing safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes from dust and debris. Do you currently have any eye protection when you work?
PATIENT: Nope. Never wore 'em. Always just blinked a lot. Thought that was enough.
DOCTOR: Blinking helps, but it's not sufficient protection against the constant dust exposure you experience. I'm going to recommend a pair of tightly fitting safety goggles. They are essential to prevent further irritation and damage to your eyes. We can discuss some affordable options. I also suggest avoiding rubbing your eyes, as this can worsen the irritation. Let's see how you respond to the artificial tears and the safety goggles for the next two weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, we may need to consider other treatments, such as a prescription eye ointment for nighttime use, or a referral to an ophthalmologist. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Sounds alright. Two weeks. Goggles and drops. Fine. Just… where do I get these goggles? And are the drops expensive? I ain't got a lot of extra money.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Pipolo. Regarding the goggles, you can find them at most hardware stores, like Home Depot or Lowe's. They typically cost between $10 and $20, depending on the style and features. I can also write you a recommendation note for a local supplier if that would be helpful. The artificial tears I’m prescribing are relatively inexpensive, generally around $8 to $12 a bottle, and a bottle should last you a couple of weeks with frequent use. We can also explore options for patient assistance programs if you are having difficulty affording them. I’m writing both of these down for you, and I will make a note in your chart. Do you have any questions about the medication or the plan?
PATIENT: Nope. I think I got it. Drops four times a day. Goggles when I work. Two weeks. Try that first. Alright. Thanks, doc. I gotta go. Got cement waitin'.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. You're very welcome. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your two-week follow-up. And remember, if your symptoms worsen at any point, contact us immediately. Get back to work safely, and take care of those eyes.
PATIENT: .
