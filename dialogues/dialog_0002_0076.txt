DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, both of ‘em, and they’re really bothering me. They’re red and kinda… hard. Been hurting for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins, red and hard, and causing you pain. And you said "a little while now"—can you give me a better idea of how long they’ve been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe a month or so? It started with just one, and I didn’t think much of it. Then another popped up, and another… and now there’s quite a few. They don’t really itch, just… ache. Especially when I walk a lot. I do a bit of gardening, you know, and that makes ‘em worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about a month, starting with one and gradually more appearing, aching rather than itching, and worsened by walking and gardening. That's helpful. Do you recall anything specific that might have triggered the first bump?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I wish I did! I haven’t changed anything in my routine, not that I can think of. No new soaps or anything. Just… appeared one day. I thought maybe a bug bite at first, but it didn’t go away like a bug bite usually does.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in routine or soaps, and it didn’t resolve like a typical bug bite. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bumps?
PATIENT: Not really. No fever, no tiredness… nothing else feels different. Just the pain in my legs. Sometimes they feel a little warm to the touch, but that might just be from walking, like I said. I haven't really checked, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other systemic symptoms like fever or fatigue, and possibly some warmth to the touch. Let’s take a look at them. Could you please point to the areas that are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Sure. These ones here are the worst. They really hurt when I press on ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. They are raised, reddish, and tender to the touch. I’m also noting some warmth to the area. Based on what you've told me and what I’m seeing, it could be a few things, including vasculitis or nodular edema. To be on the safe side, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, arthritis, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Autoimmune… oh dear. That sounds serious! No, nothing like that. I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor has me on some pills for it, but that’s it. And no diabetes, no arthritis. I get a yearly check-up, they’d have told me if I had somethin’ like that, wouldn't they?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Yes, a yearly check-up would likely have caught something like that. What medication are you taking for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a baby aspirin every day too, the doctor said it’s good for my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a daily baby aspirin. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any pills, not ever. My wife always double-checks everything with the pharmacist too, she’s very careful.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, good to have that careful check in place. Now, thinking about your family history, has anyone in your family had skin problems like this, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had some skin rashes sometimes, but I don’t remember it being anything like this. Mostly just itchy stuff. And my brother, he had arthritis when he got older, but that was in his hands and feet, not on his legs. Nothing real serious that I recall. We didn't really talk about health stuff much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, some history of skin rashes in your mother, and arthritis in your brother, but nothing similar to what you're experiencing. And no known autoimmune conditions. Lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm retired now. I mostly stay home with my wife, do a bit of gardening like I said. I like to watch some TV. We go to church on Sundays. I don’t smoke, haven’t smoked in years. I used to drink a little bit of beer, but not much anymore. We try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables. Pretty quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired, gardening, church, no smoking, limited alcohol, and a generally healthy diet. That's helpful. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, these bumps could be a few things. Given your age, history of high blood pressure and the fact they're worsening with activity, it's important to rule out some vascular causes, like a form of vasculitis. I also want to consider nodular edema, which can sometimes be related to medication. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests. A CBC to check for inflammation, and a CMP to assess your kidney function. I also think a sedimentation rate, or ESR, would be helpful to see if there’s widespread inflammation in your body. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, blood tests already? Sounds serious! But, yes, if you think it’s best, Doctor, I’ll do them. I trust your judgement. Just… tell me if anything’s really wrong, okay? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clarke, I understand. We’re just gathering information to get to the bottom of this. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, just being thorough. I’ll explain everything clearly as we get the results. Okay, here’s a lab requisition form. You can take this to the lab just down the hall, and they'll draw the blood samples. Once the results are back, usually within a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid putting too much strain on your legs – limit strenuous activity like gardening if possible. And if you notice any new symptoms – fever, redness spreading, or a lot of pain – please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just...try to explain it all to me plain, okay? I don't understand all those big words. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clarke. Absolutely, I'll explain everything in plain language, I promise. No medical jargon, just clear, understandable information. That's my priority. You take care, and we’ll see you for the follow-up soon. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
