DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Oh, my… it is good to meet you as well. Seems like just yesterday I was talking to… well, never mind. What was I saying? Oh, yes. I’ve been feeling quite sick to my stomach lately. And I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's just… not right. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Time just slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does. A few weeks of nausea and feeling full quickly… alright. Could you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like… a sharp pain, exactly. More like a queasy feeling. Just… unsettled. It comes and goes, but it's been pretty constant lately. And it doesn't really seem to matter what I eat. Even things I used to love… crackers, soup… they don’t sit well. And like I said, just a few bites and I feel… stuffed. It’s very strange. I don’t recall ever feeling this way before. Though, goodness knows, I’ve had my share of aches and pains over the years!
DOCTOR: I understand. So, constant nausea, not sharp pain, but a queasy feeling, and early satiety – feeling full after only a small amount of food. Has anything in particular seemed to trigger the nausea, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know if anything specifically makes it worse. Sometimes it's better in the mornings, but other times… not so much. I did try a little bit of ginger ale yesterday, hoping that would help, but it didn't seem to do much. And… oh dear, this is awful. I’m terrible at remembering things. I think it might be a little worse after I’ve been moving around a lot, like when I was tending to the animals, but I can't be certain. Everything just… feels muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, sometimes better in the morning, not much relief from ginger ale, and possibly a bit worse with activity. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the nausea and fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. I have been… more tired than usual, I suppose. Not just a little sleepy, but really… drained. And I haven’t been as hungry as I normally am, even before this started with the stomach trouble. Though, maybe that’s just because I feel sick all the time. And… now that you mention it, I think I’ve lost a little bit of weight, but I haven't weighed myself recently. It's hard to keep track of everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased fatigue, decreased appetite, and some unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… my. That’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. More… constipated, I think is the word. It’s been uncomfortable. I thought it might just be from not eating much, but now that you ask… it's been going on for a little while now. It’s just one thing after another, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. Kelder, but we’ll try to figure things out. Constipation alongside these other symptoms is helpful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that's a question. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must have been… oh, goodness, forty years ago? And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that. And… well, I was diagnosed with cancer a while back. Breast cancer, I believe. I had treatment… surgery and… something else. Radiation, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t remember all the details. Everything is so… hazy. I’ve been under the care of another doctor for that, of course. I can’t recall his name at the moment.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. That is important information. Breast cancer treatment is significant. Do you recall when you completed treatment?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a long time ago. Maybe… ten years ago? Or was it twelve? I really can't be sure. It feels like a lifetime ago. I was seeing a doctor at the hospital, but I haven't been back regularly since. I was feeling pretty good for a while, so I didn't think much of it. Then this… this stomach trouble started. It’s just… it’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll look into your previous oncology records to get a clearer timeline. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And… sometimes I take something for aches and pains, if they get really bad. Just ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing fancy. And… oh, yes! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor told me I was low on it. That’s about it, I think. I’m not very good at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Well, until recently, of course. I don’t recall ever having a serious allergy. Nothing I need to worry about, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing all of that information, Ms. Kelder. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your vital signs. It'll help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm just glad someone is finally taking a look at this. I haven't been feeling myself lately, and it’s good to know someone is listening. Please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, your vital signs are a little elevated, particularly your blood pressure. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart and lungs sound okay, although your heart sounds are a bit quiet. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, with some tenderness in the upper area, but no significant masses. I don’t feel anything concerning, but we’ll need further investigation. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including gastritis, a potential medication side effect, or something related to your prior cancer treatment. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we should address. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I’m also going to order a stool test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests. But… if that’s what you think is best, then yes, of course. I want to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again. And… gastritis? Is that serious? I don’t remember that one. And related to the cancer… that worries me a bit. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… please let me know what’s going on. I don’t want to be kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Kelder. It is a lot of tests, but they'll help us narrow down the possibilities and get to the root of the problem. Gastritis is an inflammation of the stomach lining. It's often not serious and can be treated with medication, but it's important to rule it out. As for your cancer history, we’re just being thorough. It’s possible that your current symptoms are unrelated, but we need to consider all possibilities, especially given your history. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health, your liver function, and whether there's any sign of inflammation or infection. The stool test will rule out any bacterial or parasitic causes of your symptoms. I’ll order those tests right away. The lab will draw your blood, and you can collect a stool sample at home. The lab will give you instructions. It typically takes a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals. Avoid foods that irritate your stomach, such as spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. And stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… smaller meals. I can try that. It’s just hard when you don’t have much of an appetite anyway. And… I think I understand. Smaller meals, no spicy foods. I’ll try my best. Um… yes, I do have a question. If it is something related to the cancer… what does that mean? Is it… spreading? I don’t want to sound dramatic, but that’s what I’m worried about. I just… I don’t want to go through all that again. It’s just… the thought of it all terrifies me.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be terrified, Ms. Kelder, and you’re not being dramatic at all. It’s good that you’re asking these questions. If it were related to the cancer—and I want to emphasize that we don’t know that yet—it could mean a few things. It could be a recurrence of the cancer, meaning it has returned in the same area or spread to another part of the body. It could also be a side effect of previous treatment. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Many things can cause similar symptoms, and the tests will help us determine the cause. If we do find something related to the cancer, we'll discuss all of your treatment options, which may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other therapies. We would also involve an oncologist to help with the plan. Right now, our focus is on gathering information and figuring out what’s going on. I want to assure you that we'll be with you every step of the way. You won’t be going through this alone. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… reassuring. Knowing you’ll be there. And an oncologist… that’s good. I remember the doctors from before. They were… very kind. Um… well, I guess I’m just worried about… everything. The tests, the results, the possibility of it being the cancer again. It’s just… a lot to process. And I’m an old woman. I don’t know if I have the strength to go through all that again. I just… want to live a little longer in peace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That is not too much to ask at all, Ms. Kelder. It’s perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed and scared. It’s okay to be worried. And it’s okay to feel like you don’t have the strength to go through it again. You’ve already been through so much, and you are incredibly strong. And we’re going to do everything we can to help you live a long and peaceful life. We’ll take things one step at a time. Once we have the test results, we’ll discuss all of your options and create a plan that’s right for you. If it is something related to the cancer, we’ll focus on managing your symptoms and improving your quality of life. And I want to assure you that you’re not alone. We have a team of healthcare professionals who are dedicated to providing you with the best possible care. And I’m here for you, every step of the way. Before you leave, I’m going to give you a referral for a social worker who can provide you with emotional support and resources. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a social worker. That sounds… helpful. Yes, please. I think I could use someone to talk to. Someone who understands. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. I feel a little bit better, just knowing you’re listening. And that you’ll try to help. It’s just… hard to face these things alone. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And for squeezing my hand. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. That’s what I’m here for. And you’re not alone. We’ll face this together. I’ll have the nurse give you the referral information for the social worker, along with the instructions for the lab tests. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, take things one day at a time. Focus on taking care of yourself, and try not to worry too much until we have the test results. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. In the meantime, please take care.
PATIENT: .
