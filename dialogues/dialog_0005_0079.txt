DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hi. It's the bruising, really. It's just...worse lately. I'm on a blood thinner, and normally a little bump is a little bruise, but it's been bigger, and showing up easier, you know? I didn't want to wait if something was up.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising...and it's increased recently despite being on a blood thinner already. That is a reason to get it checked out. So, tell me a bit more about it. When did you first notice this increase in bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It started, I'd say, maybe three weeks ago? It wasn't a huge deal at first, just noticed a few more little spots after I bumped into the coffee table. But then last week, I barely touched my arm on the doorframe and got a really big one. It just...didn't seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks ago, gradual increase, and then a more significant bruise with minimal trauma last week. And you said you're already on a blood thinner... which one are you taking, and what's the dosage?
PATIENT: Warfarin. And...um...let me see, the bottle says 5 milligrams every evening. Though, honestly, I mostly just remember that I take it, not the exact number. My sister helps me keep track sometimes. Is that okay? I'm terrible with numbers.
DOCTOR: Right. Warfarin, 5 milligrams... It's important to know the correct dosage, Ms. Hainley. Your sister helping is fine, but we need accurate information. Has she noticed any changes in how you've been feeling since starting the medication?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. It’s important. She hasn’t said anything about me feeling different, no. I mean, I'm tired sometimes, but I'm always tired. Nothing new there. She mostly just checks to make sure I took it, and refills the prescription. I've been on it about... six months now? For a clot in my leg, after the surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months on warfarin for a previous leg clot. And no significant changes in how you feel besides the usual fatigue. Have you had any bleeding issues since starting warfarin – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavier periods, blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Gums are fine, periods are…well, they stopped a long time ago. No nosebleeds, nothing in the stool, nothing in the urine. Just the bruising, and it's worrying me because it seems...easier than it should be. Like, I used to be a bit clumsy, but this is different. .
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no other signs of bleeding, just the increased bruising. And you feel it's more pronounced than usual despite being on a blood thinner. Before we get into a physical exam, let's go over some other medical history. Have you had any other significant medical conditions diagnosed, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
