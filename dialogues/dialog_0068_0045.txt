DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get very red, you see. Mostly in my face, but sometimes my neck too. It happens sometimes when I eat, sometimes not. It's been going on a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer. Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, flushing, you say. A few weeks, perhaps longer… Right. And it’s associated with eating sometimes, but not always?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Not always with food. Yesterday, it happened when I was just… sitting, reading the newspaper. And the day before, it was after a small plate of rice and lentils. Nothing spicy, mind you. Just regular food. It doesn't hurt, just… warm. And I look very red. My wife… she would always notice.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warm, non-painful flushing… happening with and without eating. Do you notice anything else happening when you flush?
PATIENT: Let me think... sometimes my heart feels a little fast, like it’s beating too much. Not a bad fast, just… noticeable. And maybe a little sweating, on my forehead. But not always that either. It's all very strange, Doctor. I don’t remember this happening before. My wife… she always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, faster heartbeat and some sweating occasionally with the flushing. It sounds…uncomfortable, to say the least. Let’s get a bit more information. Do you have any other medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems? No, not really. I used to have high blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor said it was okay, after I started walking more. And… nothing else. I try to eat healthy. Not much sugar, mostly vegetables. I’m not a big drinker, either. Maybe one small glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. I don’t feel sick, just… this flushing is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, controlled with walking… good. And no other significant medical issues. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm. Let me see… Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, very long ago. And… I had a small growth removed from my arm a few years back, but it wasn't anything serious, the doctor said. Just a mole, he called it. That is all. Nothing else, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix and a mole removal. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My father… he had problems with his stomach, a long time ago. I don't know exactly what it was, but he was always complaining. And my mother… she had diabetes, I think. Yes, that is right. Diabetes. And my sister… she had something with her heart, but I don’t remember the details. She lived very far away, you see. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of stomach problems, diabetes, and a heart condition in your sister. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not ever. I can eat anything, take any medicine the doctor gives me. My wife always said I had a strong stomach. She used to joke that I could eat anything. But she's gone now, so I don't test it much.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. And you’re currently taking no medications?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No medications at all. Just vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin, for old people. My daughter keeps telling me to take them. But that is all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications, just a multivitamin. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and just take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My wife… she always said I should listen to the doctor. Blood pressure, you say? Very good.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 88, regular. I do see some redness in your cheeks and neck. No rashes or other skin changes. Let me listen to your heart and lungs as well. Breathing sounds are clear. Heart sounds… a little fast, as we discussed, but no murmurs or other abnormalities. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Everything seems… relatively normal, but the flushing and the elevated blood pressure do warrant some further investigation. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, and also a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood tests? That sounds… serious. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I'm not very good with these things. My wife always handled the medical stuff. Is it my heart?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Withycombe. It’s more about gathering information. We’re looking for a variety of things, things that could be causing the flushing. Thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, sometimes even certain types of medications can cause this. We'll also check your blood sugar, just to be sure. As for your heart…it’s beating a little fast, which could be related to the flushing, or something else entirely. The blood tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. It’s a process of elimination, really. Don’t worry, we'll take it one step at a time. I'll get the orders sent to the lab now, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment.
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. One step at a time. Yes, that is good. My daughter said I worry too much. She’s probably right. So, the lab will call me? And I just go there, and they take some blood? Is there anything I need to do before I go? Like, not eat anything? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab will call you to schedule an appointment. And usually, for these tests, they do require you to fast for about 8-12 hours beforehand. So, no food or drinks, except water, before your appointment. I’ll make a note on the order to remind them to tell you that when they call. I’ll also have the lab results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfect, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours, no food or drinks, just water. I can do that. My daughter will be happy to hear I’m listening to the doctor. She worries about me, you see. Thank you, Doctor Sham. You've been very helpful. I feel… a little better now, just knowing what to do. .
