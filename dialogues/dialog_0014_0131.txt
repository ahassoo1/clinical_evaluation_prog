DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Slavern, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Doctor Osterholm. It’s my blood pressure, really. It’s been a little high lately, and my sister said I should get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: Sisters. Always worrying. “Lately” is…vague, though, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It is, isn’t it? Hmm… maybe about three months now, I guess? I hadn’t really paid it much mind before then, to be honest. It’s just… it’s been higher at the pharmacy when I go for my usual stuff. They said I should talk to someone.
DOCTOR: Three months… alright. And how high is "high"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I don’t really remember the numbers. I just know the pharmacist looked a little concerned and wrote it down on a slip of paper. I think it was something like… 14 with something after it? Both numbers were kinda high, I think. Does that make sense? I’m not good with numbers.
DOCTOR: “Kinda high” isn't terribly helpful, Ms. Slavern. We deal in numbers here, you see. It’s a medical practice. Do you happen to have that slip of paper with you?
PATIENT: Oh, shoot. No, I don’t. I usually just toss those things when I get home, now that I think about it. Bad habit, I guess. My apologies, Doctor. I really wish I had it. Is it bad if I don’t remember exactly?
DOCTOR: It’s…suboptimal. Look, we’ll take a reading right now, and we can go from there. But honestly, remembering things is part of taking care of your health. It's not that difficult. Have a seat. Let’s get this over with.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, you’re right. I should have remembered. I’m sorry. Let’s do it. Whatever you need me to do, just tell me.
DOCTOR: Just relax. Don't talk. And don't move. This will only take a moment. Hmm. 152 over 90. As I suspected.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? I mean, what does that mean? I just know my sister gets worried whenever I say anything about my pressure. She had some issues herself a few years back. Is it something I need to be really scared about?
DOCTOR: "Scared" is…a strong word, Ms. Slavern. It's elevated. Significantly. It means your heart is working harder than it should be. We need to determine why. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but honestly, who doesn't? I've been doing a bit more gardening this summer, maybe that's it? And sometimes I get a little headache, but those come and go. I thought it was just from the sun. Nothing major, definitely not keeping me up at night or anything. Oh! And my ankles feel a little puffy sometimes, now that I think about it. But I figured it was just the heat.
DOCTOR: Gardening, heat… everyone blames something. Tiredness, headaches…vague complaints. Ankle swelling is…slightly more concerning. Do you have any family history of…cardiovascular issues?
PATIENT: Well, my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had a stroke, I think. A long time ago though. And like I said, my sister, she was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, and she’s always telling me to watch my sodium intake. Other than that… not really. My mom was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be eighty-five. She did love her salt though, come to think of it. Everything had to have a good pinch of salt.
DOCTOR: So, a stroke, a family history of hypertension, and a mother with questionable dietary habits… Wonderful. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just a daily vitamin, really, for the bones. That’s it. And I take a little something for my allergies during pollen season. But that's just an over-the-counter thing. Is this a really bad sign? I’m starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Slavern. You're thirty-six years old. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious complications – stroke, heart failure, kidney damage… It’s a silent killer, you see. We need to rule out any secondary causes. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine sample. And I want you to get an EKG.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like… a lot. Blood work, urine sample, EKG… Is there anything smaller we could try first? I really don’t like going to the hospital, and I get nervous around needles. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: “Smaller”?
PATIENT: Well, I mean, could we try… diet and exercise first? Maybe just watch my salt intake, like my sister said, and try to walk a little more? I feel pretty healthy otherwise. I don’t want to jump straight to all those tests if it might not be that serious. I just want to know if it’s something I can fix on my own, you know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Slavern, with a blood pressure reading of 152/90, simply hoping diet and exercise will fix it is…naive. We are not here to “wait and see”. However… I’ll allow a trial period. One month. Strict sodium restriction – under 2000 milligrams per day. Daily exercise – at least thirty minutes of moderate activity. And I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I’ll write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. If your blood pressure is not consistently below 140/90 within one month, you will come back for the full workup. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. One month, under 2000 milligrams of salt, thirty minutes of exercise, and a home monitor. I can do that. It's just... 2000 milligrams is really low, isn't it? Everything has salt in it! I'll try my absolute best. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you giving me a chance to try this first.
DOCTOR: See that you do. I'm providing a concession, Ms. Slavern, not a holiday. Here. This is the prescription for the monitor, and this handout details foods high in sodium. Be diligent. And schedule a follow-up appointment for exactly one month from today. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. I really will try my best. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches. And remember…be diligent. .
