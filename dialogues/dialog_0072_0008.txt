DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, good morning. It’s… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Like… stuff is in there. It’s been… a while, I guess. Not painful, exactly. Just… full. I don’t really… remember when it started, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness in the ear… and you’re unsure of how long this has been going on. Okay. To get a better understanding, could you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… It's… hard to explain. Like when you’re on an airplane, and your ears pop? It’s not quite that, but similar. Not the pressure, just the… blocked feeling. And it seems… worse sometimes. When it's quiet, I notice it more, I think. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been… a rough few years.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s a sensation of fullness, similar to what you experience during air travel, but without the pressure. And it’s more noticeable in quiet environments. You mentioned a few rough years… has anything specific happened recently that may be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… my wife… she passed away a couple of years ago. It’s been… difficult. I’ve been trying to keep busy with the farm work, but… I don’t know. I mostly just try to ignore things, if that makes sense. I don't think that’s related, probably. Just… life, you know? Everything feels a bit… muffled these days, not just my ear. I really don't remember when the ear started bothering me. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss is… significant, and it often manifests in unexpected ways. Thank you for sharing that with me. While it may not seem directly related, stress and emotional upheaval can contribute to various physical symptoms. However, we need to determine the cause of the ear discomfort itself. To begin, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… No, not really. No pain, like I said. Maybe… a little bit of… ringing sometimes? Very faint. I mostly just tune it out. It’s hard to tell if it’s really there, or if it’s just… my head. I do get dizzy sometimes, but I always assumed that was just getting up too fast. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ear – what we call tinnitus – and occasional dizziness. And you attribute the dizziness to positional changes. Do you have any history of hearing loss, or has anyone in your family experienced hearing problems?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… I don't think so. I mean, I shout at the television sometimes, but that’s just because it’s a bad television. My wife always complained I had the volume too loud, come to think of it. And my father… he worked with heavy machinery all his life, so maybe. I really don't know. He never really talked about it. I wish I’d asked him more about things. Sorry. It’s just… hard to remember details.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll proceed as if there’s a possibility of some hearing loss. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. The doctor told me my cholesterol was a little high last year, so I'm taking a pill for that. And I had a bad knee a few years back, had to get it fixed. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy, mostly. Lots of fresh air from the farm, you know? I don’t remember anything else, sorry. My memory is… truly awful. Is this important?
DOCTOR: High cholesterol, managed with medication, and a previous knee replacement. That’s helpful. Yes, your medical history is important. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife did, she was allergic to… cats, I think? But I’m not. Nope, nothing. I’m pretty sure. Honestly, I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone allergies. Sorry. I’m really not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright. We will gather the necessary information. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the cholesterol pill?
PATIENT: No. Just the one for my cholesterol. I take it every morning with breakfast… well, most mornings. Sometimes I forget. It’s a little yellow pill. I think it's… atorvastatin? Yes, that’s it. Atorvastatin. That's all. I really try to keep things simple, if that makes sense. Less to remember. I don't want to bother you with all my… forgetfulness. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Atorvastatin. Alright. Very well. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll need to look in your ears and perform a quick hearing test. Please have a seat.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Just… please be quick, if possible. I have a few things I need to get done on the farm today. The tomatoes need… well, never mind. Just… quick is good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, I'm looking in your ears now. I see some wax buildup in both ears, which could contribute to the feeling of fullness. The tympanic membranes… appear normal in color, but are slightly retracted. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing test. Hmm. The results suggest some conductive hearing loss, likely due to the wax. I’m going to document these findings. Overall, the exam points to a buildup of earwax as the most likely cause of your symptoms. However, given your history of dizziness and possible memory issues, I do want to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Other possibilities…? Oh dear. Is it something serious? I really don’t want to have to worry about… well, anything complicated. Just the wax, you say? That sounds… manageable. I just want to be able to hear properly again, you know? Is removing the wax… difficult? Will it hurt? Sorry, I'm probably asking too many questions. I just… get anxious sometimes.
DOCTOR: It's alright to ask questions, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Removing the wax is generally straightforward. We can use a few different methods - irrigation, or manual removal with specialized tools. Neither is particularly painful, though you may experience some mild discomfort. However, given the dizziness you've mentioned, and the slight retraction of your tympanic membranes, I’d like to be cautious. A full audiological evaluation would be beneficial to assess the extent of the hearing loss and rule out any underlying middle ear issues. It would involve a more detailed hearing test performed by an audiologist. Additionally, I would recommend a brief neurological assessment, just to rule out any inner ear problems that could be contributing to the dizziness and, potentially, the memory issues. It’s a simple test, but it's best to be thorough. I’m not suggesting anything serious at this point, but it's important to investigate all possibilities. Would you be amenable to these referrals?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Referrals… more tests… It sounds like… a lot. I really just wanted the wax removed. Is the neurological test… complicated? Will it take long? I have a farm to run, you know. I don’t have a lot of time to spend at the doctor’s office. And an audiologist… Is that expensive? I just… I don’t want to get too bogged down in things. I just want to hear again. I don't know... Is there anything else we can try? Maybe just… remove the wax and see if that helps? I really don't like the sound of more tests. Sorry. I'm probably being difficult. I just... panic easily.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, I understand your reluctance. However, dismissing potential underlying issues without proper investigation would be… irresponsible. I appreciate your concerns about time and expense. We can attempt wax removal as a first step, but I need to strongly advise that it may only provide temporary relief if there's an underlying issue contributing to your symptoms. And if the dizziness is related to an inner ear problem, ignoring it could lead to more significant complications down the line. To be clear: I am not saying you have anything serious. But I have a professional obligation to rule out all possibilities, especially given your history. I will provide a referral for both the audiological evaluation and the neurological assessment. You are not obligated to schedule either appointment if you choose not to. However, I highly recommend them. If you agree, I will write the referrals and give them to you. We can proceed with wax removal today if you wish, but I will document your refusal of the recommended evaluations. What would you like to do?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do the referrals. I don't like it, but… you're the doctor. I suppose I should listen to you. But… just make it quick, please. And… is the neurological assessment very… scary? I really don’t do well with… unpleasant things. And can we please just get the wax out today? I just want to be done with this. Sorry. I’m probably being a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write the referrals for both the audiological evaluation and the neurological assessment. The neurological assessment is a relatively simple series of tests - balance exercises, reflexes, and a basic cognitive evaluation. It is not unpleasant. It’s simply a precautionary measure. I have completed the referrals. The front desk staff will schedule the appointments for you. As for the wax removal, we can proceed with irrigation today. It may cause some slight discomfort, but it is generally well-tolerated. I will use warm water and a gentle saline solution. Please recline, and we will begin. And no, you are not being a terrible patient. You are simply… anxious, which is understandable. However, I need you to be candid about your symptoms and your concerns. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I understand. Anxious. That’s me. Just… please be gentle. And let me know if anything feels… wrong. I really don't want to make things worse. And… is there anything I should be doing to prepare? Sorry. I just… I always worry about these things. Just… start when you're ready. I suppose. Please hurry.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I will start slowly and monitor your response closely. You may feel some pressure or fullness in your ear during the procedure, and you may hear some gurgling sounds. If you experience any pain, dizziness, or significant discomfort, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. I'm now beginning the irrigation with warm saline solution. I'm using a low-pressure syringe to gently flush out the earwax. I'm seeing some wax coming out now. We’ll continue until the ear canal is clear. Please let me know how you’re feeling. Okay, it seems we’ve removed the bulk of the wax. I'm going to stop the irrigation now. The ear canal appears significantly clearer now. I will examine your hearing briefly to assess the improvement. Your hearing appears to have improved somewhat, but there is still some residual hearing loss. This is not entirely unexpected, given your history. I still strongly recommend the audiological evaluation to determine the extent of the hearing loss and identify any underlying issues. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: It… feels a little better. A little less muffled. But it’s not… completely gone. It still feels… strange. And my head feels a bit… funny. Is that normal? I really don’t want anything to be wrong. I just want to hear normally again. And… what about the neurological assessment? Do I have to do that? Is it… scary? Will it take long? I have tomatoes to pick, you know. And if it's expensive… I really don't have a lot of money. Sorry. I'm probably being a terrible patient.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It is normal to experience some mild fullness or discomfort after ear irrigation, and a slight headache is not uncommon. The sensation should subside within a few hours. Regarding the neurological assessment: No, you are not required to do it. It is simply a precautionary measure, as I mentioned before. It will take approximately 30-45 minutes. As for the cost, I will have the front desk staff verify your insurance coverage. They can also discuss payment options if necessary. I understand your concerns about finances. However, I must reiterate that ignoring potential underlying issues could lead to more significant complications down the line. The neurological assessment will help us determine if there is anything else contributing to your symptoms. I am not trying to alarm you, but I have a professional obligation to rule out all possibilities. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I strongly recommend it. Do you have any further questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Fine. Alright. Tell them… tell them to schedule the neurological assessment. But… make it as quick as possible. And… please, please make sure it’s not… scary. I really don't need any more stress right now. And if it’s going to be expensive… I don't know what I'm going to do. Just… get it over with. I just want to go home and pick my tomatoes. Sorry. I'm probably being a terrible patient. But… thank you. For trying, at least.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I will inform the front desk staff to schedule the neurological assessment for you as soon as possible. I will also ask them to verify your insurance coverage and discuss payment options. I understand your anxieties, and I assure you, the neurological assessment is not typically frightening. It is a relatively simple series of tests. I will also make a note in your chart to request a brief and expedited assessment, given your concerns. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s everything. Just… please, don’t let them make me wait too long. And… thank you. For everything. I just… I just want to hear normally again. And pick my tomatoes. Sorry. I’m probably being a terrible patient. I just… get anxious easily.
