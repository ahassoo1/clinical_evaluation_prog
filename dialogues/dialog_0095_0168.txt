DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is as it should be, you understand. One has to be careful these days. I wouldn’t want any… unpleasant surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health. When you say “as it should be,” can you be a little more specific about what you're concerned about?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit… delicate. I’m not accustomed to discussing such things so openly. But, I suppose I should clarify. I want to be certain there are no… communicable diseases. And, I mean all of them. I’ve… heard stories, you know. It’s just prudent to be thorough. And to know exactly what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Of course. That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Pandolfi. We routinely screen for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, as part of a comprehensive health evaluation. We can also discuss testing for other infections as well, depending on your risk factors. To start, have you had any symptoms – anything unusual, like sores, discharge, pain during urination, or fever?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I maintain a very…clean lifestyle. That’s precisely why I’m here. I wouldn’t be coming if there were any…obvious issues. It’s preventative, you understand? And frankly, I expect a certain level of… discretion in this establishment. I don’t need a list of unpleasant possibilities paraded before me. Just reassurance that everything is in order. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Pandolfi. And I assure you, everything will be kept confidential. Since you’re not experiencing any symptoms, we can proceed with some routine blood work and a urine sample to screen for common STIs. It's good you're being proactive even without symptoms – many STIs have no visible signs. Before we get to ordering those tests, let’s quickly go through some general health questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I recall a slight reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but it was decades ago. Nothing significant. And I’m quite careful about what I ingest. Mostly, I’m concerned with ensuring this gentleman is…suitable. I don’t want to catch anything from him, naturally. Is there a test for… everything? Because I would like to be certain. And perhaps a full panel, just to be safe?
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy noted. And yes, we can certainly do a comprehensive panel. It’s good to be thorough. The standard STI panel includes tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and herpes. We can also add tests for hepatitis B and C if you’d like. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Good. Hepatitis, yes, add that. One can’t be too careful. As for medical conditions… well, my mother had high blood pressure, but I’ve always been very… robust. I watch my diet, you see. No excessive salt or sugar. And I walk every morning, rain or shine. Really, I’m quite healthy. Perhaps a bit… anxious, but that’s simply because one must be vigilant in these modern times. Are these tests…invasive? Because I have a luncheon planned shortly after this appointment.
DOCTOR: No, the tests aren’t invasive at all, Ms. Pandolfi. The urine sample is straightforward, and the blood draw is just a quick pinprick. You may feel a slight pinch, but it's over quickly. It shouldn’t interfere with your luncheon plans. Now, before we proceed, let's quickly go over your past surgical history, if any. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me think. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. A very common procedure, I believe. And…oh, yes! I had a minor cosmetic procedure a few years back. Nothing substantial. A little… tightening. One has to maintain appearances, you understand. Other than that, no. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure this extensive testing is necessary? I feel as if I’m being treated as though I’m…indisposed.
DOCTOR: It's good to have a clear history, Ms. Pandolfi. Tonsils removed and a cosmetic procedure noted. I understand your concern about the extent of testing, and you are right to question it. However, given your specific concerns about potential exposure and wanting a comprehensive picture of your health, I believe it's the most prudent course of action. Now, do you have any family history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my grandfather on my mother’s side had heart trouble. And my aunt… oh dear, my aunt passed away from breast cancer, some years ago. Very sad. Other than that, not particularly. They were a sturdy folk, for the most part. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel rather… overwhelmed. Is all of this really necessary? I simply wanted to ensure I was… safe. A quick check should suffice, shouldn’t it? Perhaps a basic panel? I’m a busy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Pandolfi. It sounds like you're feeling a bit anxious about all the questions, and I apologize if I'm making you feel overwhelmed. You’re right, we could do a basic panel, focusing on the most common STIs – chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. However, given your concerns and desire for complete peace of mind, I was trying to be thorough. Ultimately, the decision is yours. What would you feel most comfortable with?
PATIENT: Honestly? A basic panel sounds… sufficient. I suppose if I’m not exhibiting any symptoms, and I’ve been quite careful, the extensive testing seems a bit… excessive. Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis, yes. That should provide enough reassurance. I simply want to know I’m not at risk. And frankly, I’d like to get on with my day. This luncheon is rather important. Do you think that will be enough, Doctor? To rule out the most common concerns?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, that will be enough to rule out the most common concerns. We can certainly proceed with testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. That's a sensible approach. Now, before we order those tests, let's quickly review your social history. Do you currently use tobacco or alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Very rarely do I indulge in anything stronger. And no, absolutely not tobacco. I find it quite… distasteful. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. I don't engage in risky behaviors. Really, I just want to ensure this… gentleman is being forthright. Is there anything else you require before we proceed with these tests? I have a rather strict schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Pandolfi, that's all the information I need for now. So, to recap: we’ll be testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. We’ll need a urine sample and a small blood draw. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will be able to assist you. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll contact you to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to address my concerns, even if I did seem… particular. Hopefully, everything will be negative. I do try to be cautious. Perhaps you could simply give me a call when the results are available? I prefer not to check online portals. It’s just… easier that way.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. We’ll call you directly with the results. The nurse will be with you shortly to collect the samples. Don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions in the meantime. And I hope everything comes back negative as well. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon.
PATIENT: .
