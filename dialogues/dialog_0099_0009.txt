DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor Overgaard, it’s… my sight. It’s not what it used to be, naturally. Fifty-two years takes a toll, I suppose. But it’s getting… difficult. Not a complete blur, not yet, but things aren’t as crisp as they should be. I noticed it a few months back, really, but I kept hoping it would correct itself. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: A few months, you say. And it’s a gradual worsening, not sudden?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual. Definitely gradual. Not like I woke up one morning and couldn't see. It’s more… things just seem dimmer, harder to make out. Especially at a distance. Reading the newspaper is becoming a chore, even with my reading glasses. And frankly, Doctor, I’m a man who enjoys reading. It’s… unsettling. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. Unsettling.
DOCTOR: Reading glasses, alright. Are these the same prescription you've had for a while, or have you needed to adjust them recently?
PATIENT: Oh, they're fairly new, actually. Got them about six months ago, maybe a little less. When I first noticed the…dimness. I figured I just needed a stronger prescription. The optician adjusted them, but it didn't…resolve the issue, you see. That’s when I thought I ought to come see a real doctor. No offense to those vision people, but they don't have the…breadth of understanding, I suspect.
DOCTOR: A reasonable suspicion. And you’ve noticed this dimness in both eyes, or is it more pronounced in one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Though, now that you mention it, my left eye seems a bit…worse. Subtly, mind you. I'm a fairly observant man, so I do pay attention to these things, but it’s hard to be precise. It’s not like I’m running diagnostic tests on myself, Doctor. I just know things aren’t as…clear as they should be. And it’s quite bothersome, honestly. A man relies on his vision. Especially a man of my…intellect.
DOCTOR: Right. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. My ex-wife, bless her soul, always kept track of these things. I’ve always been a rather healthy specimen, to be frank. I do enjoy a good steak, perhaps a bit more than I should, but otherwise, I maintain a reasonably active lifestyle. No, I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with any of those…ailments. Blood pressure might be a little elevated from time to time, but nothing a bit of relaxation couldn't cure. I’ve never been a fan of pills, you understand. Prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though, I suppose this…vision issue might require something more substantial.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit complicated. My mother’s side…well, they weren’t particularly known for their longevity. Lots of… vague complaints, nothing specific. My father’s side, now they were sturdier folk. Farmers, mostly. I seem to recall one great-uncle who had some trouble with his eyes in his later years, but I don’t know the specifics. Cataracts, perhaps? It was a long time ago, and nobody really discussed these things openly. Not in my family, anyway. A bit… uncouth, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you currently take any medications, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Absolutely not. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy body without resorting to artificial…assistance. And surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils removed as a child, naturally. And a rather nasty bout of poison ivy a few years back required some…attention. But nothing significant. Nothing that would affect my vision, I assure you. I’m a remarkably resilient man. It’s…a gift, really. Though, this vision issue is proving rather frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. AlCorta, I think it’s time we do a quick exam. I’d like to check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and I'll take a look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Just to get a baseline. Please, have a seat in the examination chair.
PATIENT: An examination, of course. As long as it doesn't involve anything… invasive. I’m not fond of instruments poking around, you understand. Very well. Lead the way, Doctor. Though, I must say, I hope your chair is comfortable. My back isn’t what it used to be, either. Fifty-two years, you know. It takes a toll on a man.
DOCTOR: It's a standard examination, Mr. AlCorta. Nothing invasive. And the chair is… adequate. Please, just sit. Now, if you could just look straight ahead…
PATIENT: Adequate, you say? Hmm. Very well. Looking straight ahead. Yes, I can manage that. Though, I must say, the lighting in here is rather harsh. Perhaps a dimmer switch would be a wise investment, Doctor. It’s all about creating a comfortable environment, you know. Especially for a patient who’s…concerned about his vision.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. Can you read the top line for me, please?
PATIENT: The top line? Yes, certainly. Let’s see… is that… E? Yes, definitely E. Though, it’s rather small, isn't it? And the contrast could be better. I suppose my vision isn’t completely gone, but it’s certainly not what it used to be. F, P, T, O. Yes, those are correct. Though, I’m having to concentrate rather intently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, the next line, please. Don't strain, just read what you can.
PATIENT: Goodness… this is becoming rather difficult. Is that… C? No, perhaps a B? It’s all a bit blurry, Doctor. I’m really having to…force it. B…F…P…T…Oh, bother. I can’t quite make out the last letter. It’s just a…smudge. Honestly, this is quite disconcerting. Are you sure this chart is properly illuminated? It really seems rather dim.
DOCTOR: It's adequately illuminated, Mr. AlCorta. Let's just finish the test. We’ll proceed with the peripheral vision examination after this. Please, try your best. What’s the next letter?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite self-conscious. L… Yes, L. And… V. Oh… bother. Is that… Q? No, it looks more like a… U? It’s terribly indistinct. I really can’t be certain. Perhaps we should just skip to the next test. I’m clearly not performing well under these conditions. My vision is simply not what it used to be. It’s rather obvious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. AlCorta. We'll move on to the peripheral vision test. I need you to look straight ahead at this point, and tell me when you see something in your peripheral vision. We’ll start on the right side.
PATIENT: Straight ahead, yes. I can manage that. Though, I must say, this is rather… passive. I’m accustomed to actively engaging my intellect, not simply… staring into space. I… believe I see something. A… blur. To the right, I think. It’s difficult to be precise. Is it a person? A shadow? It’s terribly indistinct. Frankly, Doctor, my peripheral vision has always been…adequate. It’s my central vision that’s the concern. Is this test going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a few more… Now, focus on the central point. Do you see anything on your left side?
PATIENT: Left side… hmm. Let me see. It’s… rather dim over there, Doctor. I believe I detect a… shape. A vague outline. Is it a person? A tree? It’s terribly indistinct. Honestly, Doctor, my peripheral vision is hardly remarkable. It’s always been…adequate, at best. Is this test absolutely necessary? I’m beginning to feel quite fatigued. And frankly, I have more pressing matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for now. Now, I’m going to take a look at the back of your eyes. It’s a quick procedure, but I need you to sit very still and look straight ahead. It will be dark for a moment.
PATIENT: Dark for a moment, you say? Very well. Though, I must admit, I’m not particularly fond of instruments approaching my eyes. Please be gentle, Doctor. I have sensitive eyes. And frankly, I find the whole process rather…intrusive. I trust you’ve thoroughly sanitized that instrument? One can never be too careful, you know. And please, do inform me when you’re finished. I dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: The optic discs appear slightly pale. There’s some mild arteriolar narrowing. I don’t see any hemorrhages or exudates. Similar findings in the left eye. Slight pallor of the optic disc, mild arteriolar narrowing. The macula appears intact. Alright. That’s all. Based on my examination, your vision loss is likely due to early signs of optic neuropathy, possibly from chronic hypertension. The narrowing of the retinal arterioles supports this. It's not an immediate emergency, but it requires further investigation and management.
PATIENT: Hypertension? Chronic hypertension? Doctor, with all due respect, I occasionally enjoy a good steak. That hardly constitutes a chronic condition. And I assure you, my blood pressure is perfectly normal when I’m not subjected to… stressful examinations. Optic neuropathy? That sounds rather…serious. Are you certain you’re not mistaken? Perhaps the lighting in here is affecting your diagnosis? Frankly, I suspect this is simply a natural consequence of aging. One can hardly expect perfect vision at my age. What sort of…further investigation are you proposing? And will it involve any…invasive procedures? I trust you have a more sensible explanation than simply blaming my occasional indulgence in a good steak.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, it's not simply about enjoying a good steak. While diet plays a role, chronic hypertension often has no noticeable symptoms. That's why it's called the "silent killer." The narrowing of the retinal arterioles is a clear indicator, and the pale optic discs are consistent with reduced blood flow. See here?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, very colorful. I appreciate your efforts, Doctor, but frankly, I’m not a medical professional. I find diagrams… unnecessarily complicated. Reduced blood flow? Are you suggesting I’m… unhealthy? I assure you, I maintain a reasonably active lifestyle. I enjoy a brisk walk in the countryside, and I occasionally partake in light gardening. Perhaps this is simply a temporary condition. A slight fluctuation in blood pressure, perhaps due to the… stressful nature of this examination. What sort of… treatment are you proposing? And will it involve any…restrictive dietary measures? I trust you understand that I’m not willing to sacrifice my occasional indulgence in a good steak for the sake of a… temporary condition.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, regardless of your lifestyle, we need to confirm the diagnosis. I’m going to order a complete blood workup, including a lipid panel and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure over a 24-hour period with a home blood pressure monitor. I’ll also order an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan of your retina to get a more detailed look at the macula and retinal layers. This will help rule out other potential causes of your vision loss. I’m also referring you to an ophthalmologist for a more specialized evaluation. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: More tests? An ophthalmologist? This is becoming rather… inconvenient. I trust these tests are covered by my insurance? I’m not particularly keen on incurring unnecessary expenses. An optical…coherence…scan? Sounds rather complicated. And will it involve any…invasive procedures? I trust it won’t interfere with my daily routine. And will I need to fast for these blood tests? I assure you, I enjoy a hearty breakfast. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect this is simply a…waste of time and resources. Perhaps a second opinion would be advisable.
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to rule out other causes of your vision loss and to get a clear understanding of your condition. The blood tests require a 12-hour fast, yes. The OCT scan is non-invasive; it uses light waves to create an image of your retina, and it shouldn’t interfere with your daily routine. As for insurance coverage, I will have my staff assist you with that. However, I strongly advise you to proceed with these tests as soon as possible. The sooner we have a diagnosis, the sooner we can implement a treatment plan. I am referring you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected ophthalmologist in the area. I trust her judgment, and I believe she can provide you with the specialized care you need. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Dr. Evelyn Reed, you say? Hmm. Very well. A 12-hour fast… most inconvenient. And will it interfere with my morning coffee? I assure you, I require a substantial dose of caffeine to function properly. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather…burdensome. Very well. I suppose I’ll schedule these tests. But I expect a prompt and efficient service. I haven’t got all day to waste in waiting rooms. And if these tests reveal nothing significant, I trust you won’t charge me for this…entire exercise? I believe that’s all for now. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. AlCorta. My staff will be in touch to schedule the tests. And regarding charges, standard insurance billing rates apply. We will, of course, submit the necessary paperwork for reimbursement. I wish you all the best, and I encourage you to follow through with the recommended evaluation. Please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. .
