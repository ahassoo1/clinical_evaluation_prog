DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how everything is holding up. At my age, one likes to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: A prudent approach, certainly. And you requested a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a CBC, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, if you have suggestions for additions, I am entirely open to them. I trust your professional opinion, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve found listening to those with expertise is usually… wise.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Given your age and desire for a comprehensive assessment, I would add a PSA – a prostate-specific antigen – to screen for prostate health, and a TSH to assess your thyroid function. We should also evaluate your vitamin D levels, as deficiencies are common and can contribute to various ailments. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… exceedingly sensible, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. I hadn’t even considered the prostate or thyroid specifically, but that makes perfect sense. And vitamin D, well, one doesn't get much sunshine indoors, does one? Please, proceed with all of those additions. I appreciate you thinking of them.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been quite fortunate in that regard. My blood pressure does occasionally run a little high when I'm… excited, perhaps. But nothing that requires medication, as far as my family doctor is concerned. He always said it was just my temperament. He retired last year, a good man, Dr. Ramirez. I saw him for… oh, forty years, I believe it was.
DOCTOR: A long-term relationship with a physician is… acceptable. However, we need objective data, not subjective observations. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. You are quite right to press for specifics. Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, quite a common procedure, I believe. And I broke my left arm rather badly when I was working construction, a fall from some scaffolding. That required a rather lengthy stay in hospital, perhaps a month or so. It was… 1982, I think. A nasty break, a compound fracture. But it healed well enough, thankfully. Otherwise, no major surgeries or prolonged hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with a life of physical labor.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My father lived to be 88, quite healthy for most of his life, though he did struggle with arthritis in his later years. My mother passed away at 72, a heart condition, I believe. My older brother has some mild diabetes, controlled with diet and exercise, thankfully. And my sister… she passed away young, unfortunately, a car accident when she was only 25. A tragic loss. As for other relatives, I wasn’t particularly close to many of them, so I don’t have much information about their medical histories. A large family, scattered across Venezuela mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I pride myself on avoiding them as much as possible. A bit of aspirin if I have a headache, and sometimes a vitamin C supplement during the colder months, but that’s it. I believe strongly in letting the body heal itself whenever possible. And a healthy diet, of course. My wife, Elena, makes sure of that. She’s a wonderful cook. She’s the one who keeps me going, really.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I have eaten everything put in front of me, from arepas to… well, quite a variety of things, during my travels. And I’ve worked in all sorts of environments, dusty construction sites, humid jungles… never had a reaction to anything. Elena always worries about that, of course, but I’ve always been a sturdy sort. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing of the sort. I’m quite fortunate, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical exam, then. We'll start with your vital signs. Please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I confess, I still do a bit of light lifting when I can. Keeps the joints moving, you see. Though I’m not nearly as strong as I once was. It’s a shame. Construction was a good life.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, as you mentioned. We’ll need to monitor that. Pulse is regular, 78. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal, though there's a slight murmur. Not immediately concerning, but we'll document it. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I occasionally feel a little winded after climbing the stairs, but that’s just due to age, I suspect. No chest pain, no palpitations, nothing of that sort. Elena does nag me about taking things easier, but… well, one gets used to a certain pace, you see? It’s difficult to slow down after a lifetime of physical work. Though I do try to accommodate her. A little.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Let's check your abdomen. Please lie back. Any tenderness or pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. A little pressure, perhaps, but nothing unpleasant. I've always had a strong constitution. Many years of hard labor will do that for you, I suppose. Oh, that's a little… firm, perhaps? But no pain. Just a bit of… resistance. It could be anything, I suppose. I have a rather… robust digestive system. Elena’s cooking, you see. She uses a lot of garlic.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, let's take a look at your extremities. Please extend your arms. Reflexes are… adequate. Strength is… normal. Range of motion is slightly limited in the left shoulder. Any history of injury to the shoulder?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, as a matter of fact. That was the injury I mentioned earlier, the fall from the scaffolding. It healed well enough, but it does bother me occasionally, particularly in cold weather. A little stiffness, a little ache. Nothing debilitating, mind you. I’ve just learned to live with it. It’s a small price to pay for a lifetime of honest work, wouldn't you agree? Though I confess, lifting heavy objects is becoming more difficult these days.
DOCTOR: Very well. The physical exam is complete. We'll send your blood samples to the lab for analysis. I expect the results in approximately three to five business days. I'll review them thoroughly and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your attention to detail. Elena will likely have a few questions, of course, but I shall relay them to you at the appropriate time. I am confident in your abilities. I trust your judgment implicitly. Just… please don't tell me I need to start taking a lot of pills. My wife would be insufferable.
DOCTOR: We will address that as necessary, Mr. Mombrun. I assure you, I prioritize a conservative approach whenever possible. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. A nurse will escort you to the waiting room.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your expertise. I shall await your call with… anticipation. .
