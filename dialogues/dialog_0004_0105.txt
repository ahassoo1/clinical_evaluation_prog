DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. It’s a… bariatric surgery evaluation, she said? Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s been a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery, alright. And you're here for an evaluation. It’s good your wife is involved; it’s a significant undertaking. Let’s start with the basics. You mentioned wanting surgery for your weight. How long have you been concerned about your weight, and what specifically has prompted you to seek evaluation now?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time, definitely. I guess… since I was a kid, maybe? But it’s gotten worse, I think, in the last few years. It’s just… harder to do things. Walking, mostly. And my knees… they bother me. My wife, she’s been worried, you know? She says it’s not good for me, and… well, she’s right. That’s why we’re here, I guess. I don't really know what prompted now specifically. Just felt like… time to do something.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a longstanding issue, worsened recently, with difficulty walking and knee pain being the primary concern. And your wife is supportive of you exploring surgical options. I see your height is listed as 155 centimeters, and your weight is 139 pounds. That puts your BMI… well, we'll discuss that shortly. Before we delve into surgery, let’s get a more complete picture. Can you describe the pain in your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s kind of a dull ache, mostly. It’s worse when I walk, or go up stairs. Sometimes, if I sit for too long and then get up, it’s really stiff. It doesn't really… shoot pain, if that makes sense. Just… constant, you know? And it gets worse at the end of the day. I take… sometimes I take ibuprofen, but it doesn't always help much.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, worse with activity, stiffness upon rising, some relief with ibuprofen, but not complete. Alright. And how long have you been experiencing this knee pain specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… that's a good question. A few years, I think? It started slow, just a little bit after walking a lot, maybe. Then it just… got worse over time. I honestly lose track, Doctor. It's just been… always there, a little bit. Maybe… three or four years? I’m really not good with dates.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few years, gradual onset. Let’s move beyond the knees for a moment. Do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something a while back, but I don't really remember. I don't take any pills for it, if that means anything. And… no, I don’t think so. No diabetes. My heart… feels okay, I guess. I get a little winded sometimes, but… that's probably just from the weight, right? Honestly, I haven't been to the doctor much lately. My wife handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Possible hypertension, unconfirmed and untreated. Alright. And has anything like this – any medical problems, surgeries, or hospitalizations – run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had some heart trouble, I think. He had… a procedure done, a long time ago. Not sure what kind. My mother… she had arthritis, really bad. In her hands, mostly. And… that’s about all I can think of, honestly. It's been a while since we talked about family history. We weren’t really close, I suppose. I don’t remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Family history of cardiac issues and arthritis. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. My wife… she doesn’t like it, and I don't want to risk her getting upset, you know? Never really had the urge, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Uh… not much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. Nothing regular, though. If we go out, maybe a beer. But most nights, I just drink water. My wife doesn't drink much either, so it's not really something we do around the house.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Finally, let’s talk about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, besides the occasional ibuprofen you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen, when my knees act up. And… no allergies that I know of. Nothing I’ve ever reacted to, anyway. My wife double-checks everything before I try anything new, so I’m pretty sure I’m good there. No, no regular medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kochubey. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Sounds good. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me… good. 148 over 92. Elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing overtly concerning at this point, but warrants further investigation. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at these knees. There’s some mild swelling around both knees, and tenderness to palpation along the joint line. Range of motion is slightly limited, especially with flexion. You also have some crepitus when I move your knees… that’s a grating sensation. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. The exam confirms some osteoarthritis in both knees. Your blood pressure is elevated, and I noted a heart murmur. We'll need to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other underlying conditions. I also want an X-ray of both knees to assess the extent of the arthritis.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. Arthritis… I figured something was wrong with them. Blood work and X-rays… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just… want to feel better, you know? Is the heart murmur… bad? Is that why you want the blood work? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot of information, and it’s good you’re asking questions. The heart murmur is not necessarily bad, but it's something we need to investigate further. It could be benign, or it could indicate an underlying heart condition. The blood work will help us determine that. It's standard procedure when evaluating someone for a significant surgery like bariatric surgery. We'll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. That will give us a comprehensive picture of your health. The X-rays will show us the extent of the damage in your knees, which will help us determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. I'm going to have my nurse draw the blood samples now, and we’ll get the X-rays scheduled for tomorrow. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Blood work and X-rays… okay. Tomorrow is fine. My nurse… alright. I guess just… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. It’s just… a lot to take in. I appreciate you not rushing things. And I guess… what happens after the tests? What if… what if I’m not a good candidate for the surgery?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot, and it's important to be thorough. After the tests come back, we’ll review the results together. If the blood work is normal, and the X-rays show a reasonable amount of arthritis, we can move forward with the surgical evaluation process. That involves meeting with a surgeon, discussing your options, and determining if bariatric surgery is the right choice for you. If the blood work reveals any underlying medical conditions, or if the X-rays show severe arthritis, we may need to address those issues before considering surgery. We would discuss alternative treatment options in that case, such as physical therapy, weight management programs, or medications. It’s possible you may not be a suitable candidate for surgery, and that’s okay. Our priority is your overall health and well-being. We would work together to develop a plan that’s best for you, even if that doesn't involve surgery. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. A plan… even if it doesn’t involve the surgery. That’s… reassuring, actually. So, you’re saying there are other options? Physical therapy… I could try that. My wife has been saying I should go to physical therapy for years. Okay. Blood work and X-rays tomorrow. And then we’ll talk about the results. Okay. I think… I think that’s all I need to know right now, Doctor. Thank you again. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I… I’ll let my nurse know I’m ready for the blood work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. And yes, there are always other options. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll have the nurse come in and get started with the blood work. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. I'll see you after the tests. .
