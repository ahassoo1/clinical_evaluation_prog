DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, I’d say a couple weeks now. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a tight band, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. A headache for a couple of weeks, coming and going, and you describe it as a tight band at the back of your head. That’s helpful. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, really. Not after eatin’ certain foods, not when I’m stressed… I mean, I get stressed, like anyone does, but it’s not like the headache starts when I am. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, other times it shows up in the afternoon. It just… happens. I wish I could pinpoint somethin’ that sets it off! It's kinda random.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random headaches can be quite frustrating. And it's good you've noticed it doesn't seem linked to specific triggers like food or stress. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the intensity of these headaches at their worst?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good way to put it. Let me think… at their worst? Hmm. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating, never gets that bad. Maybe a… 6, I’d say. A solid 6. It’s enough to make me stop what I’m doin’ and just sit down for a bit, but I can still function. It’s not like I'm doubled over in pain, you know? Just…uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: A 6 out of 10, so uncomfortable enough to stop and rest, but not debilitating. That gives me a better sense of the severity. Have you noticed any other symptoms with the headaches, Percell?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry when it's really bad. Not a lot, just…fuzzy around the edges, like I need to clean my glasses, even though they are clean. And, I think… maybe I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I'm 84, so who isn’t tired? It's hard to say if that's connected or just…old age. But yeah, blurry vision sometimes. And the tiredness, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision occurring with the headaches and some increased fatigue. Thank you for sharing that, Percell. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let’s see… my knees ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. Nothing major, just makes walkin’ a bit slow sometimes. And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be 20 years ago now. Other than that… I've been pretty lucky, I think. I used to get high blood pressure, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time. Still takin’ that, yes. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old!
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your knees, gallbladder removal 20 years ago, and high blood pressure currently managed with medication. That's good to know. Could you please tell me what medications you are currently taking, and what dosages, if you know them?
PATIENT: Let me see… I keep a list, somewhere… Ah, here we go. Okay, for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day in the mornin’. And… that’s it, actually. Just the one. I used to take somethin’ for cholesterol, but the doctor took me off of it a few years back, said my numbers were lookin’ good. So, just the Lisinopril, 20 milligrams daily.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily for blood pressure. That's helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife, bless her soul, she was allergic to shellfish, but I never had any trouble with it. I've taken all sorts of medicines over the years, and never had a problem. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you most likely would. Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My family wasn’t big on talkin’ about health, to be honest. My mother, she had…heart trouble, I think. She passed away when I was still young. And my father, he had diabetes, later in life. Other than that…not that I recall. Lots of folks lived to be old, but nobody really talked about what they died of, if you know what I mean. It was just… accepted.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's not uncommon. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. Thank you for sharing that. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly take things easy these days. I live alone since my wife passed, and I like to keep busy with little things. I enjoy gardening, when the weather is nice. I used to be a big fisherman, but it's hard to get around like I used to. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not much more than that. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables. I used to be very active, worked hard my whole life, but now I mostly just… relax. And worry about my grandkids, naturally.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and you try to maintain a healthy diet. And spending time with your grandkids, that's wonderful. Okay, Percell. I’m just looking over your records here. I see your height and weight are documented as 186 centimeters and 133 pounds, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. I’m a tall, skinny fella. Always have been. Not much meat on my bones, but I get by. Always been that way. So, yes, those numbers are accurate. 186 and 133.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you for confirming that. Now, Percell, based on what you’ve told me, and reviewing your records, it sounds like you're experiencing tension-type headaches. These are very common, and often related to stress or muscle tension, even if you don’t feel particularly stressed. The blurry vision and fatigue could be related, or could be separate issues. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible to me, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Yes, a physical exam sounds good. I’m not worried, but it’s always good to be sure, right? Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it's always best to be thorough. Alright, Percell. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and coordination appear intact. Your cranial nerves are functioning as expected. When I look at the back of your eyes, I don't see any swelling or abnormalities. I do notice some tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck and shoulders. This is common with tension headaches. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Overall, the physical exam does not reveal any red flags. However, given your age and the recent onset of these headaches, I would like to order a few simple blood tests, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like anemia or thyroid issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests are no trouble at all. Better safe than sorry, I always say. Yes, please go ahead and order those. I appreciate you takin’ the time to check everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease, you know? And I trust your judgment completely. So, yes, blood tests are fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will give us a good baseline to work from. The lab is right down the hall, and you can go whenever you're ready. They’ll just need a small sample of blood. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your headaches. In the meantime, I recommend trying over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed. Also, try to incorporate some relaxation techniques into your daily routine, like deep breathing or gentle stretching. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Percell?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen, I can do that. And I’ll try the deep breathin’ and stretchin’. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to try yoga, maybe I should listen to her! No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You’ve explained everything very well. Thank you for your time and patience, Doctor Reisig. I really appreciate it. When should I expect to hear back about the test results? And is there anything I should avoid doing while we’re waitin’?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It’s my pleasure. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results, so I anticipate we should have them by the end of next week. My office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. As for what to avoid, there's no need to restrict your activities significantly. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, just continue with your usual routine and try to manage your headaches with the over-the-counter pain relievers. Do you have any work or school activities that would require a note?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I’m retired, thankfully! Just enjoyin’ my golden years, takin’ things easy. No, no need for a note. Thank you for askin’, though. You’re very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you thinkin’ of everything. Alright, well, I guess I’ll go get those blood tests done then. Thank you again for your time and help, Doctor Reisig. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. Enjoy your golden years, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. The lab is just down the hall to your left. Have a good day, Percell.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Have a good one.
