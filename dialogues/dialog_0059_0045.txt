DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I’ve been getting...flushed. My face gets very red. It started, maybe, two weeks ago? Not every day, but enough to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Two weeks of intermittent flushing. And it’s primarily on your face, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly my face. Sometimes my neck too, a little. It feels…warm, when it happens. Not a fever warm, just…hot skin. And it comes and goes. Like waves, almost.
DOCTOR: I see. And are there any specific things you notice that trigger these episodes of flushing?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think... I don't think so. Not that I know of. I eat the same things, mostly. Rice, daal…sometimes chicken. I haven’t been doing anything…different. Except… …my neighbor gave me some spice. Very strong spice, for my cooking. I used a little, maybe a week ago. But it didn’t happen right after.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. A new spice is definitely something to consider. And you said it hasn’t been immediate after using it. Just to clarify, when you say "rice and daal", are these foods you eat regularly, and have been eating for a long time?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every day, almost. For many years. My wife, she used to cook… everything. Now, it’s just me. But I make the same things she did. It’s…comforting. So, yes, same food. Always. And the spice… it was a gift. A very…red spice. Very strong smell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the flushing and warmth, have you experienced any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: No, no other symptoms. Just the red face. Sometimes a little…sweaty, when it’s bad. But mostly just red and warm. No headache, no dizziness, no…nothing else. It doesn’t hurt, either. Just…uncomfortable. It worries me because my face… it’s never been like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No associated symptoms like headache, dizziness, or pain. Just the redness, warmth, and occasionally some sweating. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general health questions, if that's alright. Have you been experiencing any fevers, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. No fever, no chills. And no night sweats. I sleep pretty well, actually. Always have. A little lonely, maybe, but I sleep. No sickness, no anything like that. Just…this face. Is this something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you're sleeping well despite feeling a little lonely. And we're going to figure out what's going on with your face, Mr. Withycombe. It's unlikely to be anything immediately serious, but it’s always best to investigate. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any. My wife used to say I could eat anything. She was always worried I’d try something too spicy! But really, no allergies. No reactions to any medicine I’ve ever taken. I don't take much medicine, though. Just… when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. And you said you don’t take many medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just when I have a bad cold. Or… something. Nothing every day. A little painkiller sometimes, for my back. But that's it. Old age, you know? Mostly, just rice, daal, and trying to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Past medical history... Let me think. I had a bad cough, maybe ten years ago? The doctor gave me something for it. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy, playing cricket. But that was a long time ago! Nothing serious, really. My wife, she was the one with the health problems. High blood pressure. That’s why she… well. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. Until this face.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate with your health overall. And I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. We'll focus on getting to the bottom of this flushing for you. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Are there any health conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Family history… Hmm. My father, he had…diabetes, I think. And my mother, she had trouble with her heart when she was older. But that was a long time ago, in India. It’s hard to remember exactly. We didn’t see doctors much, back then. Mostly just…home remedies. No one had…flushing, though. That I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Diabetes and heart trouble on your parents’ sides. And no history of flushing that you're aware of. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. Never liked it. And no alcohol, either. My wife didn't like it, so I didn't. And definitely no…recreational drugs. Never. I’m a simple man. Rice, daal, a little cricket… that’s enough for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. A healthy lifestyle is always a positive. Now, let's move on to a quick physical examination. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and take a look at your face and neck more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Please, go ahead. I just want to know what’s wrong with my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Withycombe. If you could just relax your arm for me… Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your pulse is normal. And I see the redness you’ve been describing. It's fairly widespread across your cheeks and forehead. I don’t feel any unusual lumps or bumps on your neck. It does seem a bit warm to the touch. Do you notice this redness being more prominent at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I think it’s worse in the evening. After I eat dinner, maybe. And…when I’m talking. When I get excited, or… try to explain something. It gets redder then. Not always, but mostly. It’s a little embarrassing, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Mr. Withycombe. The fact that it’s more prominent in the evening and when you’re talking suggests a few possibilities. Given your history and examination findings, my initial thought is rosacea. It’s a common skin condition that causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps on the face. The spice you mentioned could have been a trigger, even if it wasn’t immediate. However, to be certain, I’d like to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic blood work to check for underlying inflammation or other conditions. It will involve a simple blood draw. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. And if this spice… is the problem, I won’t use it anymore. I miss my wife’s cooking, but… not if it means this face. So, yes, blood work is fine. Where do we do it?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Withycombe. We have a small lab right here in the clinic, so we can do it quickly before you leave. It will just take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding any potential triggers, like the spice you mentioned. Also, using a gentle, fragrance-free cleanser and moisturizer can help soothe your skin. And wearing sunscreen daily, even on cloudy days, is important. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about rosacea and skincare tips. Now, let's go ahead and get that blood draw done, and we'll discuss the results once they're available. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just…thank you. For listening. And for trying to help. My wife… she would have liked you. Let’s do the blood work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s my pleasure. And I appreciate that. Let’s head over to the lab, and we’ll get this taken care of. A nurse will assist you with the blood draw. I’ll be right here to review the results with you as soon as they come in.
