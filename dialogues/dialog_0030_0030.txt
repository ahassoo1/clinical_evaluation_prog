DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But I've noticed a change in my body odor recently. It just… doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Changes in body odor can certainly be concerning, and it's good you brought it to my attention. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss these things; it’s a common issue. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe a month or so ago? It’s not bad, exactly. It’s just… different. A little stronger, maybe? And kind of… sharper? It’s hard to describe. I usually just smell… clean, you know? Like soap. Now it’s… more noticeable, even after I shower. I’ve tried different soaps, even, but it doesn’t really help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been about a month, and you’ve noticed a change in the scent even with good hygiene practices, and even after switching soaps. You describe it as stronger and sharper, a departure from your usual clean scent. And just to clarify, is this change all over your body, or is it localized to a specific area, like your armpits or feet?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly my armpits, I think. I haven’t really noticed it anywhere else. My feet smell normal, and I don't think it's changed on my chest or anything. It's definitely more pronounced when I'm active, like after work. I do a lot of physical labor, you know, with the floor laying. It's not a desk job, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. Floor laying is certainly physically demanding. Okay, so it’s primarily in the armpits, and it’s exacerbated with activity. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't had any fever, chills, or anything like that. No weight loss, and my appetite is normal. I’m still sleeping okay. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more than usual, even when I'm not working. But I figured that was just because of the heat, to be honest. It's been pretty warm lately.
DOCTOR: Increased sweating, especially given the recent warm weather, is a reasonable explanation. Still, it’s good to note. No fever, chills, weight loss, or change in appetite – that’s all good information. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that's it. Nothing else, really. Oh, and my doctor put me on Medicare a few years back. Is that something you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you for letting me know about the hypertension, the gallbladder removal, and your insurance coverage. It's helpful for coordinating care. Medicare is noted. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen if my muscles are really sore from work, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. That's it, I promise. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good to know what you’re taking, even if it's occasional. Lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And her mother had high blood pressure, like me. My father… he was a healthy man, mostly. He lived a long life, but he had some heart trouble near the end. Nothing else really stands out, if I’m honest. My family wasn’t really big on talking about health stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of type 2 diabetes on your mother's side, and hypertension on her mother’s side, and heart trouble in your father. It’s helpful to have that information, even if it’s limited. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… okay. Well, I’m divorced. Been that way for about ten years now. I live alone. I don’t smoke, and I don’t really drink. I used to go dancing sometimes, but I haven’t been in a while. Mostly, I just work and try to keep busy. I don’t have any pets. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful. Thank you. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, divorced, lives alone. Now, with all of this information, it's time to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your armpits. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Quicksey.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I don’t see any obvious rashes or skin issues in your armpits. There is some mild tenderness to the touch, but nothing alarming. I’m going to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll check your thyroid levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. These tests will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. I’d like to know what’s causing this, if we can figure it out. Where will I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send the order electronically to the lab just across the street, at 123 Main Street. They take Medicare, so you won’t have any issues with coverage. You can go whenever it’s convenient for you, but I recommend going in the morning, before you’ve eaten. While we’re waiting for those results, I'm going to recommend you try an over-the-counter antiperspirant with a higher concentration of aluminum chloride. Sometimes, a stronger antiperspirant can help control excessive sweating and body odor. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I can go to the lab tomorrow morning. And I’ll try the stronger antiperspirant. Hopefully, that will do the trick. Thank you, Dr. Quicksey.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. We’ll get the lab results back within a few days, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, if the body odor worsens significantly, or if you develop any fever, chills, or other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m really hoping this isn’t anything serious. Thank you again, Dr. Quicksey.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I understand your concern, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Remember, a lot of times, changes in body odor are benign and easily treatable. I’ll have the lab order sent over immediately. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
