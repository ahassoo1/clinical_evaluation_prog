DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s this cough. Been… a long time now. A dry cough, mostly. Feels like somethin’ ticklin’ the back of my throat. Not a bad cough, really, just… persistent. I don't rightly know why it started. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Right. A long time now… and you say it's dry?
PATIENT: Yes, dry. Not much… phlegm or anything. Just… scratchy. And it seems to bother me more when I lie down, I think. Or maybe it just sounds worse then? Old age, you know… hard to tell what's what anymore. My wife, she always knew… but she's… gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mostly when you're lying down. And how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. Months, I reckon. Maybe six? Maybe longer. Time… it all blurs together after a while. It didn’t start sudden-like. Just… gradually got worse, I suppose. Not somethin’ I worried about at first, just figured it was a little cold that wouldn’t quit. But it hasn’t, has it?
DOCTOR: Right. Months. And any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I get a little… tired, maybe. But I'm ninety years old! What do you expect? Sometimes a little short of breath, but that's probably just from walkin' up the stairs to get to my apartment. Nothing major, I assure you. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. Chills… not really. I do get cold easily, but that’s just… old bones, I figure. Night sweats… no, can't say I've had those. Weight loss… well, I haven't been trying to gain weight, if that makes any sense. I eat what I can, mostly. Not a big appetite anymore. But I haven't noticed losin' weight, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine? That's what the little bottle says, anyway. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin’, as far as I can remember. A little sensitive to the cold, maybe? But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine for blood pressure. Good. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your heart, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just… be gentle, if you would. These old bones aren't as sturdy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you take a deep breath for me, and then exhale slowly. Good. And again. Okay. I hear some mild wheezing on both sides, and a few scattered crackles, especially in the lower lobes. Your heart sounds a little… distant, but no murmurs or irregular rhythms that I can detect at the moment. I’ll need to check your oxygen saturation now.
PATIENT: Wheezing… and crackles? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? My wife, she always said I should have quit smokin' when I was younger. I didn't listen. Is it bad? What does it mean? Oxygen… what does that measure? I always get confused by all these… things.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen is 92%, which is… acceptable, but on the lower end. The wheezing and crackles suggest some inflammation in your lungs, possibly from… well, a number of things. It could be a mild pneumonia, bronchitis, or even just age-related changes. Given your history… and your cough… we need to rule out some more serious possibilities. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and some blood work to get a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood work? Oh my. That sounds… serious. Is it somethin' really bad? I just want this cough to go away. It's been botherin' me for so long. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then do what you need to do. Just… try not to poke too many holes in me. Old blood doesn’t heal as quickly as it used to. And… who pays for all this? I don’t have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: The x-ray and blood work will give us more information, and it's not necessarily anything serious. It’s just… standard procedure. As for the cost, we'll see what your insurance covers. I'll have the billing department contact you to discuss payment options. Alright, let’s get you down to radiology for the x-ray. Then we’ll draw some blood here in the office. Do you have someone who can drive you home afterwards?
PATIENT: Insurance… oh, I don’t have any insurance. Never could afford it. I just… figured I’d get by. Drive me home? No, I walk. I live just a few blocks away. I always have. I’m used to it. Just… a little worried about walkin' after all this… pokein' and proddin', you said. But I manage. I always do. Is it going to hurt? The blood work, I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. No insurance… okay. Well, the blood work is just a small prick in the arm. It’ll sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t be too bad. We’ll get you a bandage afterwards. Alright, I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. Then I’ll send you down to radiology for the x-ray. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Rest… and fluids. Yes, I can do that. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For lookin' after an old man like me. It’s kind of you. I suppose… let's get it over with. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can go home and rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be right in. .
PATIENT: .
