DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburroborough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I just... I want to have a baby. A healthy one. My husband... well, he was a healthy man, but things… didn't work out, and now I want to make sure this one isn't… problematic. Is that enough information? I don’t have a lot of time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You want to optimize your chances of a healthy pregnancy, especially given some past concerns. That's very responsible of you. “Problematic” is a little vague, though—can you tell me a bit more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really remember much. It was… a long time ago. There were some tests, I think. And the baby… wasn’t strong. It just… wasn’t. Look, I don't need to relive it, okay? I just want to know what I need to do now to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Blood tests? Pills? Just tell me the checklist.
DOCTOR: Okay, I completely respect that you don’t want to go into detail. We can absolutely focus on what you need to do now. It's good you're thinking about this proactively. To get started, I’d like to get a comprehensive medical history from you – past illnesses, surgeries, medications you’re currently taking, allergies, family history… things like that. It'll help me understand if there are any potential risk factors we need to address. Then, we can run some blood tests to check your overall health, including things like your hormone levels, and screen for any infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? Infections? Look, I’m a healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise... mostly. I’m not sick. My husband’s family… they were all strong people, farmers and such. I really don’t see what all this digging around is for. Can’t you just give me a vitamin or something? A pill to make everything perfect? I don't have time to list my grandmother's ailments, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I wish I could just give you a simple fix. But unfortunately, it's not always that straightforward. Even healthy women can have underlying conditions or genetic predispositions that could affect a pregnancy. The tests aren't about doubting your health; they’re about gathering information so we can minimize risks and give your baby the best possible start. Just to start, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… a multivitamin, okay? The usual stuff. And sometimes I take something for my allergies, but it’s just when the pollen is really bad. Some pink pill... I don’t even remember the name. Look, is that all you need? Because this is getting ridiculous. I need to get back to work, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and an allergy medication—that's helpful. Knowing even a little bit is good. And I do understand you're busy, I promise I'm trying to be as efficient as possible. The allergy medication...do you remember when you typically take it?
PATIENT: When… look, spring and fall! When everything is blooming or dying, alright? It’s a pink pill, like I said. I take it when I start sneezing. Does it really matter? It's not like I'm popping pills all day. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what I need to do, instead of interrogating me about flower seasons?
DOCTOR: Okay, spring and fall, when you have allergy symptoms. I ask because some allergy medications contain ingredients that aren’t recommended during pregnancy, so it’s good to know what you’re taking. We can look up the exact medication later. To move forward, and since you’re wanting to get pregnant, have you had a recent physical exam, and do you know your last menstrual period date?
PATIENT: A physical? Ugh, no. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, it's been a while. My husband handled all that. And my… period? Look, it was… last month, I think. Maybe the month before. Honestly, I don’t really keep track. It’s always… regular enough. Is that good enough? I really don’t understand why you need all these exact dates!
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent physical and your last period was roughly last month or the month before. I understand it’s frustrating to have to recall details, but knowing approximately when your last period was is important because it helps us estimate how far along you might be, should you be pregnant, and plan any necessary tests. Before we consider any testing, let’s quickly go over your family medical history. Do you know if any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Look, my family was… sturdy. Farmers, mostly. Strong hearts, strong backs. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her stomach sometimes, but nothing serious. My father was perfectly healthy until… well, never mind. My grandparents… they lived long lives. Mostly just… old age stuff. No fancy diseases or anything. Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with me having a baby. Can’t we just… skip this part?
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy family history. I appreciate you sharing that. It’s helpful, even knowing there’s a lack of significant medical issues. Let's do a quick physical exam. It will just be basic—blood pressure, weight, a listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I really don't have all day for this poking and prodding. Just… do whatever you need to do, quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. This won't take long. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within a normal range. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Your weight is 130 pounds, and your height is 164 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of 24.2, which is also within a healthy range. Everything seems normal so far. Given your history and this initial exam, I recommend a blood test to check your hormone levels, screen for any infections, and assess your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get the test done. Whatever it takes. I need to know if I’m… good to go, or if I'm wasting my time. Let’s just… do it. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. I’ll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, a vitamin D level, and a rubella titer. The nurse will draw your blood now. I'll review the results when they come back, and we can discuss them and plan next steps. It should be about a week before we have the results. In the meantime, continue taking your multivitamin as usual. Do you have any questions for me before I get the nurse?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell me when I can expect the results. And can I just get a printout or something? I don’t want to have to come back for another long appointment just to hear what’s on a piece of paper. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nurse will let you know when you can expect the results—approximately one week. And yes, I’ll make sure you get a printout of the results, and I'll also include a brief summary of my recommendations with it. If you have any questions after reviewing the results, feel free to call the clinic, or schedule a brief follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Carmaleta?
PATIENT: No. That's all. Just… get it over with. I’m wasting my time here. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, Carmaleta.
