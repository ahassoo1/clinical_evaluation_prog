DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San Sciarotta Clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s good to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need to get a card so I can drive for… those ride-sharing companies. Uber, Lyft, that sort of thing. I understand I need a medical card for that, and someone told me you could help me with that. I want to get it done as quickly as possible, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A commercial driver’s license medical exam. That’s perfectly alright, we can certainly get that done for you. It is fairly straightforward. Just to confirm, you're looking to get certified for ride-sharing, like Uber and Lyft?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Ride-sharing. And maybe taxi work, if the opportunity comes up. I mostly just want to be able to do that legally. Is there a lot of paperwork? I'm not very good with forms, to be honest.
DOCTOR: There is some paperwork, yes, but we have staff who can assist you with that. Don't worry, we’ll walk through it together. First, let’s just go over some basic medical history to ensure you meet the requirements. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be, from all the years working with the logging equipment. Arthritis, I think the doctor told me, years ago. Nothing that stops me from doing things, just a bit of pain sometimes. Other than that… not really. I had my gallbladder out, oh, maybe fifteen years ago? But that was all fine. And high blood pressure, but I take medicine for that. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and high blood pressure managed with medication. Thank you. Can you tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's Lisinopril, I think. A small white pill. 20 milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for…oh, goodness, probably ten years now? It keeps everything pretty stable. I get it refilled regularly, so my regular doctor knows all about it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her garden, and we grew all sorts of things, so I’ve probably been exposed to plenty of pollen, too. Never a problem. Is this taking long? I have a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Not at all, we're almost done with the history part. Just a few more questions, I promise. Have you ever had any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: No, not really. I wear glasses for reading now, since I got older, but my distance vision is still okay. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said everything was fine. Just the normal age-related changes, they said. I can see well enough to drive, I assure you. I've been driving for…well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, glasses for reading, last eye exam last year was normal. Good. Now, just to get a better picture, have you ever had any issues with dizziness, fainting, or seizures?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. I get a little lightheaded sometimes if I stand up too quickly, but that's just from getting older, I think. But never anything serious, like fainting or…seizures. No, never had one of those. I’m very steady on my feet, considering. I still do a bit of gardening, you know. It keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any history of heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… my father had a weak heart when he was older, but I haven’t had any problems myself. No lung problems, no. And no diabetes, thankfully. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly vegetables and fish. I do enjoy a sweet treat now and then, but not too often. I think I’m pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Okay, San, just to complete the exam, I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, and listen to your heart and lungs. We'll also do a brief neurological assessment – just checking your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. Let’s just get this over with, shall we? I’m starting to get a little anxious about being late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as quick as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go. Just let me know if it’s going to pinch much, alright? My skin is a little sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… Um… E, F, P, T… Yes, I can read those. Um… Let me squint a little… H, J… I think that’s it. My reading glasses would help, but I figured I’d try without them first. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. Your vision is within acceptable limits for driving. Now, just a few quick neurological tests. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Up, down, left, right… Is that okay? I’m trying to keep my head still. It’s a little hard, my neck isn't as flexible as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that tight enough? I used to do a lot of gardening, so I still have some strength in my hands. I try to stay active, you know. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, and just a few quick checks of your reflexes. And the other side. Everything seems normal. Alright, San, everything looks good. Based on my examination, you meet the medical requirements for a commercial driver’s license. I'll complete the necessary paperwork for you.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news! Thank goodness. I was worried I’d have to come back another day. How long will the paperwork take? And will it be something I can take directly to the licensing office? I really appreciate you getting this done so quickly, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Just a few more minutes. It’s mostly standard documentation. Here you are. This is the Medical Examination Report – Form MCSA-5876. You'll need to take this to the licensing office. They may also require a copy of your driver's license and your insurance information. It shouldn’t take too long at the office. I’ve also included a copy for your records. Do you have any questions about the forms or the process?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect. Thank you so much. It looks… complicated, but I'm sure I can figure it out. I think I see where to put my information. Is there a website I can check to make sure I have everything I need before I go to the office? I don’t want to waste a trip if I’m missing something.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here’s the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website: [https://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/medical-requirements]. It has a checklist of everything you'll need. I’ve also highlighted the relevant section for commercial driver’s licensing. It’s a bit of bureaucracy, I know, but it's all standard procedure. Do you have any other concerns or questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s fantastic, thank you so much for the website. That will be a huge help. No, I think that’s everything. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and getting me in and out so quickly. You’ve been a lifesaver. I’ll get this paperwork sorted out and head to the licensing office as soon as I can. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. I'm glad I could help. Drive safely, and good luck with everything. Have a wonderful day! .
