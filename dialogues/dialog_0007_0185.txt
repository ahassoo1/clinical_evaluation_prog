DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day, so… it’s my breath. It smells bad. Really bad, apparently. My ex-husband definitely made it clear. It’s… embarrassing. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand wanting to get this sorted quickly. “Bad breath” – medically we call that halitosis – can definitely be embarrassing, but it’s also often something we can figure out pretty easily. Let's try to narrow down what might be going on. First, has this been a recent thing, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Ugh, “halitosis”. Seriously? Just… a while. Like, months, I guess. It comes and goes, but mostly it’s there. It’s not like it suddenly appeared last week. And honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things. Is this going to involve a lot of questions about when I last brushed my teeth? Because that’s just… rude.
DOCTOR: No, no intense tooth-brushing interrogation, I promise. Just trying to get a sense of the bigger picture. When you say it "comes and goes," are there any times it seems worse?
PATIENT: Well, mornings are pretty bad. Like, really bad. And… after I eat, sometimes. Especially if it’s something… strong. Garlic, onions… you know. Normal food. Not like I'm eating rotten stuff or anything. And… sometimes when I’m stressed. Which is… often, these days. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, mornings, after eating certain foods, and with stress – that’s good information. And you're right, normal food is perfectly normal! Let’s rule a few things out. Do you notice any coating on your tongue?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t even want to look at my tongue right now. You want me to look at my tongue? That’s… unpleasant. I guess… yeah, sometimes it looks kind of white. But I mean, isn’t that normal? Everyone’s tongue isn’t pink, right?
DOCTOR: It can be a little unpleasant, I agree. But it helps us see if there’s anything going on with bacteria. And yes, tongues aren’t always perfectly pink. Let me just take a quick peek... Okay, I see a bit of coating on your tongue, which can contribute to the odor. Now, have you been having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm not… sick or anything. Just stressed and divorced, which is probably enough symptoms for one lifetime, honestly. No cough, no fever, no… I don’t know… weird stuff coming out of my ears. Just bad breath. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: No cough, fever, or other unusual symptoms – good. And I completely understand, stress and a recent divorce are enough symptoms for anyone! Let me ask a few quick questions about your mouth itself. Do you have any pain in your teeth or gums?
PATIENT: No. They ache sometimes, but it’s… old. I had a lot of work done a while ago, and it’s just… lingering discomfort. Not new pain. It’s not like there's a toothache or anything. Honestly, I try not to think about my teeth too much. They're expensive and annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, lingering discomfort from previous dental work, but no new pain. And you mentioned stress. Are you currently experiencing any dry mouth?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! Actually, yeah. Now that you mention it, my mouth feels… dry a lot. Especially when I’m… you know… thinking too much. Which is always. I have to drink water constantly. Is that… connected? Please tell me it’s connected to the stress, not something else awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, dry mouth is definitely connected, and it's very common with stress and anxiety. Saliva helps wash away bacteria, so less saliva can absolutely contribute to bad breath. Given what you’ve told me – the dry mouth, stress, and the coating on your tongue – it sounds like we’re dealing with a situation where decreased saliva production is likely a major factor. I’m going to recommend a few things. First, focus on staying well-hydrated – carry a water bottle with you and sip on it throughout the day. Secondly, there are over-the-counter saliva substitutes you can try, like Biotene. Do you have any allergies or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no regular medications. I… avoid doctors as much as possible, so I haven’t been prescribed anything in years. Honestly, the less medical intervention, the better. So, just water and… Biotene? Is that it? That sounds… manageable. Is there anything else? Because seriously, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, for now, let's start with the increased hydration and Biotene. We can also talk about some sugar-free gum or lozenges to stimulate saliva flow. I also recommend continuing good oral hygiene – brushing twice a day, flossing, and cleaning your tongue. Given your history of previous dental work, I think it would be prudent to see your dentist for a check-up and cleaning, just to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be able to schedule that soon?
PATIENT: Ugh, the dentist. Of course. Look, I don’t… love the dentist. They’re expensive and… judgy. But fine, I’ll… try to make an appointment. I don’t know when, though. I have to check my schedule. And… that’s all? Water, Biotene, and a dentist appointment? Seriously? It’s not something… horrible? Because I was bracing myself for something awful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. It doesn’t sound like anything serious, thankfully. It sounds like we can manage this with a few simple changes. We’ll see how things go, and if it doesn’t improve, or if you develop any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Honestly, the less talking, the better. I appreciate you not making me feel completely awful about my breath, I guess. And… I’ll try the water and Biotene. Fine. I’m going to go now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. And you're very welcome. Remember, staying hydrated and seeing your dentist are the most important things right now. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
