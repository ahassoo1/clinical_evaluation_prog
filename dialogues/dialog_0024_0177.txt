DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s… it’s somethin’ down there. It’s… leakin’. That’s what my niece told me to say. She filled out all these papers, you know. I don’t really… understand all the big words. It's just… wet. And kinda…icky.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” right. Very specific. And how long has this “leakage” been occurring, Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Long time. Maybe… a week? Two? Time kinda… blurs. It just started one day, and I thought it was somethin’ I ate. Then it didn’t go away. My niece, she said I gotta come see a doctor. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: A week or two. And is this… continuous, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Not all the time. Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it's not. When I… when I use the bathroom, it’s definitely there. And sometimes, just… when I'm sittin’ around. It's just… bothersome, that’s all. You know, a lady doesn't like bein’ bothered.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, occurring with and without urination. Alright. And is there any pain associated with this “leakage,” Ms. Genard?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s not right. A little burnin’ sometimes, maybe. But not like… a real bad pain. You know? Just… off. It's hard to explain. Old bodies do funny things.
DOCTOR: “Off.” Right. Well, we need to be a bit more precise than “off,” Ms. Genard. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything unusual?
PATIENT: Urine? I don’t… I don’t look at my urine! What kind of question is that? It’s… yellow. Usually. Sometimes darker, sometimes lighter. I drink lots of juice, you know. That makes it… brighter. I don’t sniff it or anything! Honestly, young man, this is very personal.
DOCTOR: Of course. Very well. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't felt hot. Chills… well, it gets cold sometimes, but that's just the air conditioner. And my tummy… no pain. Sometimes it grumbles, but that's just old age. I ate a bad mango yesterday, maybe. It’s always somethin’. Honestly, I don't know why I even came here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Genard, with all due respect, I need to perform a brief examination to determine the cause of this “leakage.” I understand it’s personal, but it’s necessary. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, please. And perhaps we can expedite this process if you simply answer my questions directly.
PATIENT: Examine?! Oh, no. No, no, no. I didn't come here for anyone to look at me! My niece told me I had to come, but she didn't say anything about… that. I'm a respectable woman, young man. I've lived a long life, and I don't need you pokin’ and proddin’. I'm not lyin’ down for anyone. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I assure you, this is standard medical procedure. I cannot diagnose your condition without a physical examination. And frankly, your vague descriptions are not helpful. If you refuse to cooperate, I can document that refusal and recommend you seek care elsewhere. I have other patients waiting. It’s a matter of time management, you understand. Do you wish to proceed with the examination, or shall I prepare a discharge summary stating your refusal of care?
PATIENT: Discharge?! You want to kick me out?! I came all the way here! My niece is gonna kill me. Look, I… I don’t like this at all. But… is there anything else you can do? Maybe… a test? Like with my water? Not… not lookin’ at things! Just… a sample. A simple sample. Please, young man. I just want this to be over with. And I don't want my niece to yell at me.
DOCTOR: A urine sample, then. Very well. We can start with that. It’s not ideal, but it’s better than nothing. I’ll have the nurse bring you a collection cup and instructions. And Ms. Genard, I need a complete list of any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you may have. Please, try to be as specific as possible. This is important. Don't leave anything out.
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, geez. I take a little bit of everything. For my joints, mostly. And sometimes something for my tummy. My niece buys them for me. Little white pills, mostly. Sometimes blue. I don’t know the names. I just… take them when I hurt. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat everything! Mangos, pineapples… everything! Oh, wait… sometimes I get a little itchy when I eat shrimp. Just a little bit. Does that count? This is hard. I wish my niece was here.
DOCTOR: “A little itchy” when you eat shrimp…right. Look, Ms. Genard, I need specifics. Do you have any boxes or bottles of these medications with you?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't carry 'em around! I left 'em at home. My niece, she keeps 'em in a big plastic bag. She’s very organized, that girl. I just... grab a handful when I need 'em. It's hard to remember which ones are for what. They all look the same. Oh… wait! I have this one in my purse. For my blood pressure. My niece said I should take it every day. Here. See? Little red ones. That's all I got with me right now.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine 5mg… daily. Alright. And you are taking this for high blood pressure, as prescribed?
PATIENT: High… blood what? My niece told me to take it with my breakfast. She said it was for… my heart, maybe? I don’t really pay attention to all the fancy words. I just want to feel better. This whole thing is makin’ me nervous. Can I just give you my sample now? I need a glass of water!
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you momentarily to collect the sample. Please try to provide as much urine as possible. And try to relax, Ms. Genard. I’ll review the results when they are available. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. And please don’t tell my niece about all this. She worries too much already. Just… thank you. I guess. Now, where's that nurse? I really need a glass of water. And maybe a little mango juice. That'll calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will inform the nurse of your request for hydration. .
PATIENT: .
