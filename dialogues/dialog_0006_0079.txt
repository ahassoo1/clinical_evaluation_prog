DOCTOR: Alright, Courtnye, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Gorga. It’s… well, it’s my bruising. It’s just been getting worse, and I’m on that blood thinner stuff, you know? Warfarin, I think it's called. It feels like I bump into stuff and get a bruise the size of my hand now. It's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Right, bruising… and you’re on warfarin. Okay. How long have you been noticing this increased bruising, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about a month ago? Maybe a little longer. It was just little things at first, like a small bump and a little color. But the last week or so it’s been… significant. I bruised my leg just walking into the grocery store, honestly. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: A month, getting worse the last week… and a larger bruise from minimal trauma. Okay. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really… I mean, work's been the same, stressful as always with the security stuff. I haven’t started any new medications, and I'm eating… pretty much the same. Oh! Actually… I did start drinking a little more herbal tea. Chamomile mostly, for trying to sleep. Does that matter? I didn't think it would, but you know… with the blood thinner…
DOCTOR: Herbal tea… chamomile specifically. Yes, that could matter. Some herbal supplements can interact with warfarin. Do you remember how much chamomile tea you’ve been drinking a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Probably… three or four cups a day? Maybe more on bad nights. It's not like a ton, is it? I just thought it would help me relax. I read somewhere it was good for sleep. I'm starting to worry I messed something up.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four cups… chamomile can interfere with warfarin’s effectiveness. It’s not ideal. Let's just get a quick rundown of your other medications and any other supplements you take, just to be sure. Then, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check the bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. No other meds, just the warfarin. And honestly, just the tea. I don't really take anything else. The exam is fine, too. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and if I need to stop drinking the tea. I really don't want to have to stop my security job.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your bruising. Can you show me the bruise on your leg that you mentioned?
PATIENT: Sure. Here. It's pretty bad, huh? It doesn't really hurt, just… feels a bit tender. And it came up so quickly after just bumping into the grocery cart. It scared me a little, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, that is a significant bruise. And you're right, it shouldn’t have appeared so easily. Palpating… tender to the touch, but no signs of swelling or warmth. Any other bruising anywhere else that you’ve noticed recently?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I do have a couple of small ones on my arms. Nothing huge, just little spots. I thought they were from carrying groceries, but maybe not? They're not new, just… been there a few days. I mostly ignored them. I just figured I was clumsy. I do a lot of lifting at work, with the servers and stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. A few small spots on the arms as well. No signs of underlying issues. Okay. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. So, based on what you’ve told me and the initial examination, it does seem like the increased bruising could be related to the warfarin and potentially the chamomile tea. It's hard to say definitively without some bloodwork.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Bloodwork sounds… good. If it’s the tea, I can definitely stop drinking it. I just… I really don’t like feeling like I’m messing things up. Is bloodwork going to take long? I have a meeting at 2 and… well, it’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, a PT/INR test will tell us how well your warfarin is working. It should only take a few minutes to draw the blood, and the results usually come back within an hour or two. We can likely get it done here in the clinic. To be safe, I'm going to recommend stopping the chamomile tea immediately. And until we get the results, let's be extra cautious with any activity that could cause injury. Do you have any known allergies to latex, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. No latex, no medications, nothing. Okay, stop the tea, be careful… got it. An hour or two, huh? That might be tight for the meeting. Is there anything we can do to speed up the results? I really need to be there. It’s about a security update, a major one.
DOCTOR: Let me see… unfortunately, the lab on site is the quickest option we have readily available. An hour to two hours is typical. I can call ahead and see if they can prioritize the results for me, but I can’t guarantee anything. In the meantime, while we wait, I'd like to ask about your family history. Have any close relatives had issues with bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom… she bruised easily, now that I think about it. But she just said she was clumsy, like me. No real medical issues, though. And my dad was pretty tough, never got sick or anything. No one really talked about bleeding problems. It wasn't really a topic of conversation. We’re Tongan, and my family doesn’t really talk about health stuff much, you know? It's just… not done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of easy bruising, but no confirmed bleeding disorders. That’s good to know. Okay. I'm going to step out and call the lab to see if they can expedite the results for you. In the meantime, is there anything I can get you – water, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I'm okay, thank you. Just… I guess I'll sit here and try not to worry. And hope the lab can hurry up. This meeting is really important.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be right back with any updates. Please, just try to relax. I’ll be just outside if you need anything.
