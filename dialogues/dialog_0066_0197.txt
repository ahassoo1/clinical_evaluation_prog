DOCTOR: Hi, San. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA Clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be perfectly frank, I need a card to drive for those ride-share things… Uber, Lyft, that sort of business. I believe you call it a Commercial Driver Medical Card? I want to make sure I’m all cleared to do it, you know? I’d like to get this done as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a Commercial Driver Medical Card, got it. And you want to make sure you’re fit to drive for Uber or Lyft. Absolutely, we can do that. It's good you're getting it checked out beforehand – safety first! To get started, let's go over some things. First, I'll pull up your chart to see what information we already have. I see here you’re 70 years old, Japanese descent, and your height and weight are listed as 5’1” and 139 pounds. Is that all still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all correct. Five foot one inch… well, maybe a little closer to five foot two on a good day, but five foot one is fine. And 139 pounds is right. I haven't really changed much in years. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to make sure this doesn’t take all day, if you understand. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, San. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, so for the Commercial Driver Medical Card, we need to cover a pretty comprehensive health history and do a physical exam. It’s a bit more thorough than a regular check-up, but it's necessary for the requirements. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned it a few years back, but it’s been mostly under control with diet. No diabetes, thankfully. My heart… well, it sometimes skips a beat, but nothing serious, I don't think. Just old age, probably. I did have a hip replacement about ten years ago, and I get a little arthritis in my knees, but those aren’t really problems, are they? I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to work with logging equipment, you know – tough work!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. High blood pressure managed with diet, occasional skipped heartbeats, hip replacement ten years ago, and arthritis in the knees. We’ll definitely want to get more details on each of those. Let’s start with the high blood pressure. Do you know what your blood pressure readings typically are?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers… I’m terrible with numbers. My daughter usually handles all that paperwork. The doctor told me to watch my salt intake, that’s all I remember. I try to, but sometimes a little soy sauce is just too good to resist. I haven’t had it checked recently, I suppose. Maybe six months ago? And it was… normal, I think. She would have told me if it wasn’t. Honestly, I’m better at operating machinery than remembering blood pressure readings. Is this going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, don’t worry about the exact numbers. We can check it right here today, and that will give us a good baseline. It’s good you've been watching your salt intake, that's a great start. Since your daughter usually handles the paperwork, do you know if you've had any other tests done related to your heart or blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… she did mention an EKG once, maybe a couple of years ago. Something about checking the rhythm. It was all normal, she said. And… oh! A stress test! That was right after the EKG, just to be sure. They had me walk on that treadmill. I was puffing and panting, but they said it was all good. Honestly, Doctor, I feel fine. Sometimes a little tired, but who isn’t at my age? I don’t want to waste your time with all this… Is it necessary to go through all this if I feel perfectly capable of driving?
DOCTOR: It's good to know you had an EKG and a stress test, and that those were normal. That’s very helpful information. We do need to cover all the requirements for the Commercial Driver Medical Card, even if you feel capable of driving. It’s a federal regulation to ensure everyone on the road is safe. It's better to be thorough and make sure everything is within the acceptable limits. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis in the knees. It's called… hmm. I’ll have to look. It’s a white pill. My daughter orders it for me. Oh, wait! Here it is. Meloxicam. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for the pain, if the Meloxicam isn’t enough. That’s all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don’t like how they make me feel. Vitamin D, too. The doctor said I was low on it. But that’s hardly a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Meloxicam for arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and Vitamin D. Thank you for letting me know. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with food, and I’ve tried all sorts of things in my life. No reactions to any of the pills the doctors have given me, either. I'm a pretty tough old bird, I think. But… I do get a little itchy sometimes, if I’m out in the poison ivy. But that’s just a rash, isn’t it? Not a real allergy. Honestly, Doctor, are we almost finished? My knees are starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug or food allergies, just occasional itching with poison ivy. We are getting there, San. Just a few more things, and then we’ll do a physical exam. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your hip replacement?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but that was ages ago. And… oh! I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but that was mild. I stayed home for a week with a fever, but I didn't have to go to the hospital. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky. I've always been strong and healthy, even working with all that logging equipment. Really, I think I'm in pretty good shape for my age. Is this all necessary to be so thorough? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child, pneumonia a long time ago, but no hospitalizations for anything else. It is a lot, I know. The Commercial Driver Medical Card requires us to be very thorough to ensure safety for you and others on the road. We need to cover all the bases. Now, let’s move onto family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that's a tough one. My mother lived to be ninety, and she was healthy as a horse. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died when I was young, something about chest pains. And… my brother had cancer, lung cancer, but he smoked like a chimney. Honestly, we didn't talk about health much in my family. We just kept going. Is it important to know all this? It feels like a lot of digging into the past. I’m starting to feel a little tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother healthy to 90, father with heart issues, brother with lung cancer due to smoking. It is helpful to know, San. It gives us a better understanding of your overall risk factors. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, absolutely not! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, it was awful. And alcohol… just a little glass of sake with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I'm a law-abiding citizen, Doctor. I used to work with heavy machinery, you know, couldn't be doing any of that. I think that covers everything, doesn't it? Can we get to the physical exam now? My knees are really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drugs. Yes, that covers most of the important questions. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Alright, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. I hope this doesn't take too long. My knees are really acting up today. Just… hurry it along, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we'll need to document it. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Finally, I'll check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Oh, vision… well, it isn’t what it used to be. Hmm… E… F… P… T… is that a… R? Oh dear. This is awful. I need new glasses, I think. Everything is blurry. I told my daughter, but she’s always so busy. It's probably just old age. I can’t see a thing! Is this going to be a problem for the card?
DOCTOR: Okay, your vision is somewhat impaired. We’ll need to get you a referral to an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam. For the Commercial Driver Medical Card, you’ll need to meet certain vision standards. Now, let's just quickly check your pulse and listen to your abdomen. Pulse is regular and abdomen is soft and non-tender. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what we’ve discussed and the physical exam, we have a few things to address before we can issue the Commercial Driver Medical Card. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, your vision needs to be assessed, and we need to document the heart murmur.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. So, I can’t get the card right away? I was hoping to start driving next week. This is a mess. What do I need to do? New glasses, a doctor for my heart… Is this going to cost a lot of money? Honestly, I just wanted a simple card so I could earn a little extra income. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, San. It’s not ideal, and I apologize for the added complications. You're right, it’s not a simple process, and we need to ensure you meet all the safety requirements for the card. Let’s break it down. First, I’m going to write you a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. They’ll be able to assess your vision and prescribe new glasses if needed. Second, I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist to evaluate the heart murmur I detected. It’s likely nothing serious, but we need to get a professional opinion. Regarding cost, I’m not sure of the exact fees for the ophthalmologist or cardiologist, but our office staff can help you navigate insurance coverage and potential financial assistance programs. We will need documentation from both specialists before we can issue the Commercial Driver Medical Card. Once we have those reports, we'll review everything and let you know if you meet the requirements. It may take a few weeks to complete all these steps, but it’s important to prioritize your health and safety. Do you have any questions about this process?
PATIENT: Well… that's a lot to take in. I suppose I have no choice, then. Yes, I do have a question. My insurance… Medicare, it's called. Will that cover all this? I don't want to be surprised with a huge bill. And… how long will it take to get an appointment with these doctors? I live in a rural area, and it's not always easy to get seen quickly. I really need to know if this is even worth pursuing if it's going to cost a fortune and take months to complete.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, San. Let me check Medicare coverage for both the ophthalmology and cardiology referrals. Okay, it appears Medicare does cover comprehensive eye exams and cardiology consultations. However, there may be co-pays and deductibles depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can help you verify your coverage and estimate your out-of-pocket costs. Regarding appointment availability, you’re right, rural areas can have longer wait times. I’m going to have our staff contact both specialists in your area and see what their current availability looks like. They can also help you schedule the appointments and coordinate any necessary transportation. It may take a little effort to get everything coordinated, but we’ll do our best to make the process as smooth as possible for you. I don't want financial concerns or long wait times to prevent you from pursuing this if it's something you really want to do. We will work with you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… somewhat reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. If you can really help me with the appointments and the insurance, then I suppose it's worth trying. Honestly, I just want to earn a little extra income, and I thought this would be a good way to do it. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… please have your staff contact me as soon as possible. And… could you give me a copy of this referral paperwork? Just in case. I appreciate your help, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. It’s my job to help you navigate these things. And please, don't apologize for your age – it’s a sign of wisdom! Here are the referrals for the ophthalmologist and cardiologist. Our staff will be contacting you very shortly to schedule the appointments and discuss your insurance coverage. They'll be able to answer any further questions you may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I'll let your staff handle the rest. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I really appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. We’ll do our best to expedite the process. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns along the way. Have a good day, San, and please take care. We'll be in touch shortly.
