DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And it’s not like I’ve been doing anything to be tired, if that makes sense. And…well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough that I figured I should probably mention it to someone. Don’t look at me like that. It’s…it’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hardenburgh. Thank you for sharing that with me. It takes courage to discuss things that feel…unusual. Let’s unpack this. The tiredness is the primary concern, and you've noticed it's worsening despite not having increased activity. And you've also been experiencing pica – the urge to eat non-food items, specifically dirt, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red clay. Don't make a big deal of it, alright? It’s not like I’m going around shoveling it into my mouth. Just…little bits. And it doesn’t even taste good. I don’t even want it, but…I just feel like I need it sometimes. It's ridiculous, I know. And the tiredness…it's beyond just feeling sleepy. It’s like all my energy is just…gone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It doesn't sound like you're enjoying it, and you're feeling a compulsion, which is important information. And you're right to describe it as a need, rather than a craving. This isn’t something to be dismissed. The tiredness you describe – a complete lack of energy – that's concerning as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long you've been experiencing both the tiredness and the urge to eat clay?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The tiredness…it started, oh, maybe six months ago? Gradually. I thought it was just getting old, to be honest. You get to a certain age and things just…slow down. But the dirt thing…that’s more recent. Maybe three months? Four? It started with just a little taste, then it got to be…more often. I find myself thinking about it all the time. Honestly, it’s probably a habit now. A bad one.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months for the tiredness, gradually worsening, and three to four months for the clay ingestion. That helps. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see…well, I’ve been a bit…forgetful, I suppose. More than usual. Though, at my age, that’s hardly a revelation, is it? And…my stomach hasn’t been quite right. Sort of…upset. Not terrible, just…off. No vomiting or anything, thankfully. Just…not settled. And I get cold easily now, even when it’s warm.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness, digestive upset – not severe, but a general unsettled feeling – and feeling cold more easily. Thank you. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I’m hungry, don’t eat when I’m not. It’s not like I’ve lost interest in food, or anything. Though…I haven’t been eating as much meat lately. Just…doesn’t appeal to me. I used to love a good steak, but now…it just doesn’t seem worth the effort. Everything feels like effort these days.
DOCTOR: So, a decreased interest in meat, specifically. And overall, a sense of fatigue making everything feel like an effort. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Nothing major, really. I had the flu, badly, a few years back, but that's it. High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, but it wasn’t bad enough to need medication, she said. Just watch my salt, she told me. I try to. And…arthritis, in my hands. Makes it hard to grip things sometimes. That’s about it. Nothing serious, I assure you. I've always been a healthy woman, despite my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, managed with diet, and arthritis in the hands. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always avoided them. Too risky, if you ask me. My mother always said, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." And I’ve always lived by that motto. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a long, long time ago, but that was it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise no surgeries. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…well, my mother lived to be 92, so good genes on that side. She had arthritis, like me, and…heart trouble, towards the end. My father…he died young, in a car accident. Didn't know him very well. As for siblings…I had a brother, but he passed away a few years back. He had diabetes, if that’s relevant. And…that’s about it. Nothing really stands out. We weren't a family that talked much about our health, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with longevity and arthritis, father deceased at a young age, brother with diabetes. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? I live alone. Always have, really. Never married. Don’t have any children. I keep to myself mostly. I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop when the tiredness got so bad. It just…took too much out of me. I don't drink, don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely leave the house these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, lives alone, never married, no children, retired from volunteering due to fatigue, non-smoker, abstains from alcohol. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, I don’t believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. The doctor offered me something for my blood pressure once, but I declined. I’d rather just watch my diet. And I don’t bother with vitamins or anything like that. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with pills when I’ve been forced to take them. Honestly, I’m a pretty simple woman. I don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hardenburgh. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Then we’ll discuss some possible causes for your symptoms and what steps we can take. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I’ve got better things to do, but…if it gets me out of feeling like this, then I suppose. Just be quick about it, alright? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. 162 over 98. A bit elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Now, I'd like to check your conjunctiva and oral mucosa. The conjunctiva appears pale and the oral mucosa is slightly dry. Now, can you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your skin recently?
PATIENT: Pale? Dry? I haven't paid much attention, honestly. I just…feel tired all the time. Skin...no, not really. Maybe a little dry in the winter, but that's normal, isn't it? Look, I told you, I don't bother with things like that. I'm an old woman. Things wear down. You're going to tell me I need to drink more water, aren't you?
DOCTOR: Conjunctival pallor, slightly dry oral mucosa, and reports of general fatigue. Now, based on the information you've provided and the initial exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. The tiredness, the pica, the elevated blood pressure, and the pallor are all concerning. Given your symptoms, I'm particularly concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia, which can sometimes cause cravings for non-food items like clay. However, we also need to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly. More poking and prodding. Fine, get it over with. But don’t expect me to be thrilled about it. And don’t tell me it’s going to be expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you know. What exactly are you hoping to find? Just tell me plainly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hardenburgh. We'll discuss the cost with the lab and see if any assistance programs are available. The blood tests will help us determine if you are iron deficient, if you have any other vitamin deficiencies, and assess your overall kidney and liver function. It will also give us a baseline to compare against if your symptoms worsen. We'll check your red blood cell count, iron levels, and vitamin levels. The results will help us determine the cause of your fatigue and pica. I’m also going to ask a few more questions about your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, diet. Honestly, it’s not very exciting. I usually have toast for breakfast, maybe with a little jam. Lunch is a sandwich, usually ham and cheese, or sometimes just soup. And dinner…well, it depends. Sometimes I make a little chicken, sometimes it’s just leftovers. I don’t eat a lot of vegetables, to be honest. Never have. And I drink a lot of tea. That’s about it. Simple.
DOCTOR: Toast, sandwiches, chicken, and tea. Limited vegetable intake. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Never. And weight loss? I haven’t been weighing myself. Probably a bit, but I figured that was just from getting older. Everything sags when you get old, you know. I haven’t been paying attention to that sort of thing. Honestly, I've got more important things to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. No reported blood in stool or significant weight loss. Given your symptoms and the limited dietary information, I’m still concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia, or other nutritional deficiencies. I’m going to order a referral to a hematologist for further evaluation. They can perform additional tests and determine the underlying cause of your fatigue and pica. In the meantime, I recommend trying to increase your iron intake through diet. Lean meats, beans, and leafy green vegetables are good sources of iron. I’ll write the referral order now and give you the contact information for the hematologist's office. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A hematologist? More doctors? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I just want to feel normal again. Fine, give me the number. But if they start asking a lot of complicated questions, I’m hanging up. And I’m telling you now, I’m not changing my diet. I’ve eaten the same way my whole life, and it’s never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's never pleasant to see multiple specialists. The hematologist will likely ask some detailed questions to get a clear picture of your health history, but we’ll work together to make sure you understand everything. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a multivitamin supplement, just to ensure you're getting adequate nutrients. It won’t cure anything, but it’s a simple step we can take. Here is the referral slip, the contact information for the hematologist, and a prescription for a daily multivitamin. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: A multivitamin. Fine. Whatever. Look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I'm not holding my breath. I’ve seen doctors come and go my whole life, and none of them have ever really figured anything out. Just get me out of here, alright? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hardenburgh. I understand. I've documented all of our discussion and the plan of care. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here's the discharge paperwork. I wish you all the best and hope you find some relief soon. Please schedule an appointment with the hematologist as soon as possible. Have a good day, Ms. Hardenburgh.
