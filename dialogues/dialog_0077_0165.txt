DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. Really gets me down, ya know? Been happenin’ for…oh, I dunno, a couple months now, maybe longer. It ain’t nothin’ serious, probably. Just want to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A recurring fever, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Comes and goes. Not every day, not every week, but it pops up. Feels like a regular flu fever, chills and all. Gets me tired, mostly. Makes it hard to even do a little work at the office, and I hate missin’ work. It usually breaks after a day or two, but then it comes back a week or so later. It’s…annoyin’, to say the least.
DOCTOR: I understand. And when you say “a couple of months,” can you recall roughly when the first instance of this fever occurred?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. April, maybe? Around tax season, I think. Yeah, definitely April. I was feelin’ pretty stressed then, always am around that time, to be honest. But the fever wasn't because of the stress, I don't think. Just…started around then. I remember thinkin' it was just a bug, but it keeps comin’ back, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fever and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I get a little achy, you know? Like my muscles are tired. Not a bad ache, just…uncomfortable. And I’ve been sweatin’ a bit more than usual, even when it ain’t hot. That’s about it, I think. No cough, no sore throat, no nothin’ like that. Just the fever, the tiredness, and a little bit of achiness. Honestly, I'm not one to complain, Doc. I'm just hopin' it's not somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Just to be thorough, let’s review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. I’ve been lucky, always been pretty healthy. A little arthritis in my hands, but that’s just from years of workin' with people’s backs, ya know? My wife, Elena, she’s got high blood pressure, but I don’t. I eat okay, try to walk when I can, nothing fancy. Never been hospitalized for anything serious, never had any surgeries. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doc.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little ibuprofen sometimes, when my hands are botherin' me. And occasionally a multi-vitamin, just to be safe. Elena keeps tellin' me I should take more, but I forget, honestly. Nothing regular, nothin' the doctor prescribed, just stuff you can pick up at the store. Small doses, when I need ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Elena's got a little trouble with shellfish, but I can eat whatever. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty boring that way, Doc. No allergies, no fancy medical problems… just this pesky fever.
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Brege, have you travelled outside of the country recently, or been exposed to anyone who has?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left Puerto Rico in…oh, gosh, maybe twenty years? Elena and I used to travel a bit more, but not anymore. We like it here, family's here. And no, nobody I've been around has been traveling either, not that I'm aware of. Just folks from around here, you know? It ain't like I've been hangin' out with any tourists.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Sure, Doc, go ahead. Whatever you need. I just wanna get this figured out, ya know? I don’t mind a little look-see, long as it don't take too long. Got some folks waitin’ back at the office.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your temperature. 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit. A little elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart rate is regular, though a little fast. Now, let me palpate your abdomen. No tenderness or masses noted. Everything seems…relatively normal, physically. However, the recurring fever warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Sounds good… or, I guess, not good that it needs investigatin’, but I'm glad you're lookin’ into it. What kinda investigatin’ are we talkin’ about? Blood work? X-rays? Just tell me straight, ya know? I ain't afraid of a little poke if it gets me an answer.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brege, some blood work is necessary. We'll need to check for signs of infection, inflammation, and rule out any underlying conditions. I'd also like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. We may also need to consider a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues, given the recurring nature of the fever and the slightly elevated heart rate. Do you have any insurance coverage that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc, no insurance. Always meant to get some, but it's expensive, ya know? Never really needed it before, knock on wood. Elena's got a little through her work, but it don’t cover me. How much is all this gonna cost, roughly? I gotta be honest with ya, money's a little tight right now. Don’t wanna get a bill I can’t handle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, I understand. Without insurance, the blood work will likely cost around $150-$200, and the chest X-ray approximately $200-$300. I can discuss potential payment plans with the billing department, and we can prioritize the blood work first to get a better understanding of what's going on. We can also explore options at the local health department for financial assistance. Let's start with the blood work and see what the results show. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc, that sounds sensible. Blood work first, see what that says. And thanks for lookin' into payment plans, I appreciate that. Elena's gonna be glad you're helpin' me figure this out. Let's get it done, then. Where do we go from here? Just tell me what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. They'll draw a few vials of blood. It'll only take a few minutes. Once the results are back—usually within 24 to 48 hours—we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll also have my nurse, Maria, give you some instructions on aftercare. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as shortness of breath, severe chest pain, or a stiff neck—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yeah, Doc, crystal clear. New or worse symptoms, emergency room. Got it. Room three, phlebotomist, blood work. I think I can manage that. Thanks for explainin' everything so clearly. I’ll go get this done, then. I appreciate your help, really. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brege. Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions. I'll see you soon. .
