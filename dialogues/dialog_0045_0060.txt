DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks. Well, it's…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of…issues. Heart stuff, mostly, but also, you know, other things. Cancer, that sort of thing. It’s just…nagging at me. I want to make sure I don't end up the same way. Preventative, really.
DOCTOR: “Preventative,” right. Everyone says preventative. Look, a family history is…helpful, I suppose, but it's not a crystal ball. Still, we can go through it. Let's start with the heart stuff. Your mother – what specifically was wrong with her?
PATIENT: It was…complicated. A lot of blockages, I think. She had a stent put in, then another one. Eventually…well, she had a heart attack. It wasn’t pretty. My aunt, her sister, had something similar. High blood pressure for years, then…the same thing. That's what I'm worried about, honestly. I don't want to end up needing a bunch of procedures. I try to eat well, but…you know. It’s hard.
DOCTOR: “Complicated.” Right. That’s what they always say. Stents, high blood pressure… alright. And you said “something similar” with your aunt – do you know what specifically happened with her?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not really. My mother handled all the medical stuff. I was…busy. And after it happened, no one really talked about it. It was…awkward. Just that she had chest pains, then ended up in the hospital and…didn't make it. Look, I'm not a doctor. I just know there was a lot of heart trouble on that side of the family. Is that good enough? I just want to know if I need to worry about this constantly.
DOCTOR: “Awkward.” Wonderful. Look, I'm trying to get a medical history here, not a family drama lesson. Knowing that something “happened” isn’t terribly useful. But fine. We’ll work with it. So, let's focus on you. Do you currently have any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, I don't have chest pain! That's why I'm here, isn't it? I'm trying to prevent things, not treat them! Honestly, this is…frustrating. I feel like you’re not listening. I’m worried, and you’re asking me if I'm currently experiencing symptoms. Of course not! I want to know what tests I need, what I should be looking out for, that sort of thing. Not if I'm about to have a heart attack right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… agitated. I’m just trying to establish a baseline. Look, you’re young, relatively thin… statistically, you're not at immediate risk. But a family history changes things, even if you're perfectly healthy now. So, let’s get some bloodwork done. Cholesterol, triglycerides, basic metabolic panel… the usual. And we’ll do an EKG. Just to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Bloodwork and an EKG…yes, that sounds…reasonable. As long as it’s actually going to tell me something. I don't want to just be poked and prodded for no reason. And if anything comes back abnormal…you’ll explain it to me, right? In plain English? I don't want a lecture about medical jargon. Just…what it means for me.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain it to you. In…layman’s terms. Though I can’t promise I’ll be able to dumb it down completely. Fine. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. It's a quick test, just some stickers on your chest. And then we'll go over the results when they come back. Don’t expect overnight miracles, though. These things take time.
PATIENT: Alright. Stickers, fine. Time, I understand. Just…please don't tell me everything is “normal” if there's even a slight cause for concern. I'd rather know the truth, even if it's not what I want to hear. And if you see anything…anything at all…call me. Don't wait for a scheduled appointment. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Theriot. I will call you if there’s something… concerning. Though I highly doubt that will be the case. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be with you momentarily.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. .
