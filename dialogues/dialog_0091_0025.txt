DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… uh… want to know more about where my family come from. I hear you can do… tests with spit? To see… old, old family? I want to know about that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re referring to genetic ancestry testing, often done through a saliva sample. It can provide information about your ethnic origins and trace your family history back many generations. It's a fascinating area, and we do offer consultations regarding these tests, and can arrange for the testing itself. Before we proceed, could you clarify what specifically you’re hoping to learn from this testing?
PATIENT: Well… my mama, she from Marshall Islands. But before that? I don’t know. Lots of stories, but… not sure what true. I want to know true. See if stories right, or… if other people in my family, far back, from other places too? Does it tell you that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, that’s precisely what these tests can help with. They analyze your DNA to estimate your ethnic proportions – essentially, the percentages of ancestry you have from different regions around the world. It can certainly shed light on your family's origins beyond the Marshall Islands, and corroborate or expand upon the stories you've heard. It’s important to understand these tests aren't perfect. They provide estimates, and the accuracy can vary depending on the regions involved. Also, they won't tell you who your ancestors were specifically, just where they likely originated. Before we discuss ordering a test, I’d like to gather a bit more information about your medical history, just as a standard precaution before any genetic testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. I don’t have much history. I pretty healthy for old man, I think. Never been to hospital much. Just… little things. Aches and pains. Mama, she had… I think high blood pressure. But she gone now, long time. You need more than that? I not very good remembering things, sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. We’ll take things at your pace. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful, thank you. And it’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. To be thorough, let’s quickly go through a standard review of systems. This just means I’ll ask you a few questions about different parts of your body to see if you've experienced any recent changes or symptoms. We’ll start with your general well-being. Have you noticed any recent unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Weight… same always. Maybe little less, when I busy making models. Forget to eat sometimes. But not much. I small man anyway. Always been small.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And what about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Tired sometimes, like any old man. But I always liked to work with wood. Keeps me busy. I don’t feel… weak, or anything. Just… slower, maybe. Not so much energy for big things anymore. I mostly sit when I work now. Used to stand all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Scobie. That’s helpful. And have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations – any fluttering or racing of your heart?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Heart good. I think. Never had problems with heart. Sometimes… little bit dizzy when I stand up fast, but that happens when I get old, yeah? Not much trouble. I walk to shop every day. Slow walk, but I walk.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your daily walk, Mr. Scobie. And dizziness upon standing is common, especially with age. We can discuss some strategies to help with that later if it becomes bothersome. Now, let’s move on to your digestive system. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Everything… normal. Old man problems, maybe. But nothing bad. I eat lots of fish. Good for me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Scobie. Fish is indeed very good for you. Now, thinking about your skin – have you noticed any new moles, changes in existing moles, or any unusual skin rashes or sores?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Skin… just old skin. Lots of sun when I young. Fishing, working outside. Not much new. Sometimes itchy, but that just from heat. I put lotion on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any difficulties with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Little bit hard to see far away now. Need glasses for drive. Hearing… sometimes people talk quiet, I ask them repeat. Normal for old man, yeah? Mama, she had trouble hearing too.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, those changes are very common with age. And it’s not uncommon for hearing to decline as well. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can discuss the ancestry testing if you’re still interested. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Hands good. I make models with them, remember? Feet… sometimes ache when I walk too much. But I rest them. Not numb, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to hear. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns, or any feelings of sadness, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: Sleep… okay. Sometimes wake up in night, go to toilet. But I sleep mostly. I not sad, Doctor. I lonely sometimes, but that just… life, yeah? I have my work. My models. That make me happy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Scobie. That was very helpful. It sounds like you're generally in good health for your age, which is wonderful. Now, going back to your original question about ancestry testing – would you like me to explain the process in more detail, discuss the different types of tests available, and address any concerns you might have?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. I want to know what I need to do. And how much cost? And… what it tell me for sure? Not just… maybe. What it tell me for sure?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Let’s start with the process. The most common type of ancestry test involves collecting a saliva sample – you simply spit into a tube, and the sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The lab then analyzes your DNA for markers that are associated with different ethnic groups. The results are typically available online within a few weeks. Now, regarding cost, it varies depending on the company and the type of test. A basic test, providing an estimate of your ethnic origins, typically costs around \$100 to \$200. More comprehensive tests, which include information about your maternal and paternal lineages, and potential relatives, can cost \$300 or more. However, as you rightly pointed out, it’s crucial to understand the limitations. These tests do not provide definitive answers. They offer estimates of your ethnic proportions, based on comparisons to reference populations. The accuracy can vary, and the results should be interpreted with caution. For example, the reference populations used by these companies may not be representative of all ethnic groups, and the results may be influenced by the geographic region where your ancestors lived. They can't tell you specific names or locations of your ancestors with certainty. They are a starting point for exploring your family history, but should not be considered conclusive proof. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: So… it tell me maybe I have some Chinese, or something? But not for sure? And I still have to find out the rest myself? Like… stories from old people?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Scobie. You’ve understood perfectly. It might suggest a small percentage of ancestry from a region like China, for example. But it won’t tell you which ancestors were from China, or when they lived. It's more like a general indication of potential origins. Think of it as a clue, a starting point for further investigation. The stories from your family, historical records, and genealogical research – those are all essential pieces of the puzzle. The test can help you focus your research, by suggesting regions where your ancestors may have lived. It can also be a fascinating way to connect with your heritage and learn more about your family's history. Would you be interested in me providing you with a list of reputable ancestry testing companies and some resources for genealogical research?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be good. List of companies. And… where I can find old stories. Maybe on computer? I not very good with computer, but… I can try.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here, let me print out a list of several reputable companies – AncestryDNA, 23andMe, and MyHeritage DNA are all popular choices. I’ll also include their websites. I’ll also include some links to websites that can help with genealogical research, such as FamilySearch and FindAGrave. These sites have extensive databases of historical records and family trees. And yes, you can definitely find old stories online. Many historical societies and libraries have digitized their collections of oral histories and family records. It might take some time and effort, but it can be a very rewarding experience. I can also recommend a local genealogical society if you’d like some assistance with your research. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you very much. You explain everything good. Not like… push me to buy something. Just… tell me truth. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. My pleasure entirely. It’s my job to provide you with accurate information and help you make informed decisions. And you are right, I believe in honest, transparent communication. If you decide to pursue the ancestry testing, or if you need any assistance with your research down the line, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie, and enjoy exploring your family history. .
