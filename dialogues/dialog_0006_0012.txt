DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor Gorga. I am here because I am planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a form completed by a physician. It’s just to confirm I am fit enough to travel, you understand. A simple matter, I hope.
DOCTOR: Yes, a travel form. Right, right. Simple enough usually. Though, “simple” depends on… well, a lot of things. Let’s start with your general health. Anything major going on right now?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, no. I was terribly sorry to lose my husband last year, if that’s what you mean by major. But health-wise… I get a wee bit of stiffness in my knees, especially when the weather turns damp. And I tire a bit easier than I used to, but that’s probably just… getting older, isn’t it? I don’t take any regular medicines, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: I see. Loss is… difficult, certainly. And yes, stiffness and fatigue are common as we get older, but we still need to rule things out. The knees… how long have you been noticing that stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, it’s been a few years now, I suppose. It comes and goes, really. Worse in the winter, as I said. Not enough to stop me doing anything, mind you. I still manage my garden, and I walk most days, though perhaps not as far as I used to. It’s just a bit of a creakiness, you understand. Not a sharp pain, never that.
DOCTOR: Okay, “creakiness”... good to know. And the fatigue… has that been a recent change, or has it been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I’d say. It’s not like I wake up exhausted, it’s just… at the end of the day, I need to sit down sooner. I used to be able to potter about all evening, but now I’m content to read or watch television instead. It’s not a complaint, Doctor. Just… a noticing, you understand. A change.
DOCTOR: A noticing. Right. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, or any shortness of breath when you’re walking?
PATIENT: No, not a bit of swelling. My ankles are quite slender, actually. And no, no shortness of breath. I might puff a little going up a hill, but that's just from the exertion, I expect. I’ve always been a bit breathless on hills! Though, now that you mention it… sometimes my chest feels a wee bit tight, but only when I’m feeling anxious. And I haven’t been overly anxious lately, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness with anxiety… okay. And, just to get a full picture, have you had any fevers, chills, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fevers or chills. My appetite is… normal. Perhaps a wee bit smaller than it used to be, but I put that down to… well, not having a husband to cook for anymore. It doesn't feel like I’m losing weight, if that makes sense. I've always been… slight of build, you understand. And I certainly enjoy my food when I do eat it!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing much to report, truthfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and the like, but I recovered well. I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, that’s all. No serious illnesses, no hospital stays, nothing like that. I’ve been a very healthy woman, thankfully. My husband wasn't so lucky, sadly. He had a touch of bronchitis every winter, but I always managed to keep him comfortable.
DOCTOR: Tonsils out as a child… Good. Any surgeries aside from that?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the tonsils. And vaccinations, of course, as a wee girl. I think I’ve kept up with all the boosters, but to be honest, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure. It was a long time ago, and my husband always handled those sorts of things. I’m terribly sorry, I’m not very good with remembering dates and details like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. We can look up some of that if need be. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. My mother lived to a good age, eighty-nine, but she suffered terribly with arthritis in her hands. My father… he had a weak heart, I believe, but he passed away quite suddenly when I was a young woman. I don't recall any other major illnesses in the family, to be honest. It wasn't a family that talked much about their ailments, you understand. More of a stiff upper lip sort of family.
DOCTOR: Arthritis in your mother, heart issues with your father… and a bit of a stoic family. Alright. And finally, before we move on, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a bit. I've always been able to eat anything and everything. I enjoy a good variety of foods, you see. I've never had a reaction to any medicines or foods. No allergies at all, thankfully. That’s one thing I don't have to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers. That’s very helpful. Just one last thing, and then we'll do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked a pipe, but I always made sure he did it outside. And I have a very small glass of sherry with my supper sometimes, but that’s all. And recreational drugs… well, that’s not something I’ve ever been interested in, no. I’m a very sensible woman, you understand. I like a good book and a quiet evening, that’s all the recreation I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just check your blood pressure and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your judgment entirely. Let’s get it done, shall we? I’m eager to get this form completed and book my cruise!
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. Please loosen your clothing a bit. First, let’s take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very good. I always feel a bit flustered when having my blood pressure taken, Doctor. It always seems to be a bit high! Though I’m perfectly calm, really. It’s just the anticipation, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm… and breathe normally. 135 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning given your comment. Let’s listen to your heart now. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Alright. Everything sounds good so far. Now, could you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. Is that alright? I always worry I don't breathe deeply enough. I suppose I'm a bit of a shallow breather.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let's just check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Everything seems to be within normal limits. We'll just send off a quick blood test to rule out anything underlying, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A blood test sounds sensible. Are you expecting anything particular to be amiss? I do hope not. I'm quite looking forward to my cruise, you understand. It's been a long time since I've had a proper holiday.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just a routine check. Mostly looking for any signs of inflammation or anemia. It’s standard procedure when clearing someone for travel, especially a longer trip. It’ll just give us peace of mind. I'll order the tests now, and the results should be back in a few days. Let me just pull up the travel form…
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Peace of mind is always a good thing. I do appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It's very reassuring. And a few days is perfectly acceptable. I haven’t a pressing rush, thankfully. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood test? Fasting, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, please fast for at least eight hours beforehand. No food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. And avoid strenuous exercise the day before. Otherwise, it's a pretty straightforward test. Alright, I've filled out most of the form here. It’ll need your signature once we have the blood test results. Here's a copy for your records. Once we get the results back, we'll review them, and if everything looks good, I'll sign the form and you'll be all set to go.
PATIENT: Oh, excellent. Eight hours fasting, no strenuous exercise… I can manage that easily enough. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and kind. I feel much more confident now. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Where do I go for the blood test?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, Room 3. You can just tell them you're here for a travel screen ordered by Dr. Gorga. They’ll take care of everything. It should only take about fifteen minutes. Once they’ve taken the sample, you’re free to go. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are back, usually within three to five business days. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions admirably. Room 3, it is. I shall pop down there this afternoon and get it sorted. And I'll await your call with bated breath. Thank you again for your time and assistance. I truly appreciate it. It’s a relief to know everything is being taken care of so professionally.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise when the time comes! And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good afternoon.
