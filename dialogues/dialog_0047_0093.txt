DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well… honestly, it’s a bit of a blur, trying to remember exactly why I booked this. Something about… not sleeping so great? And feeling a bit… floppy, I suppose. It’s not a pressing issue, mind you. I just thought I’d get it checked, if you follow. I do a lot of bending over instruments all day, you see. Probably just that.
DOCTOR: "A bit floppy," is… not a typical complaint, Mr. Redfern. But we'll get to the bottom of it. Not sleeping well and feeling generally weak… that’s certainly worth investigating. Let's start with the sleep issue. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, how long? See, this is the problem. Months, I think? Maybe longer. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning all night, every night. Just… not refreshing sleep, if that makes sense. I wake up feeling like I haven't really slept at all. I don't know... I used to be able to jump out of bed, ready to go. Now… not so much. Honestly, it's probably just getting old. Though I don't feel old.
DOCTOR: "Getting old" at 29 is… unlikely to be the primary cause, Mr. Redfern. Though I appreciate your optimism. So, months of non-restorative sleep. Any particular triggers?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I work long hours in the shop, fiddling with… well, instruments. Lots of concentration. But I’ve always worked hard. It’s not like I’ve suddenly started doing anything different. And my wife… she always said I slept like a log, even with all the noise. It’s just… quieter now, I suppose. Not that that would… never mind. Probably irrelevant.
DOCTOR: “Quieter now?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. She… used to snore. A lot. Not complaining, you understand. Just… there was always something. Now it's just… still. I don’t know why I’m even mentioning it. It’s probably nothing. Look, honestly Doctor, maybe I’m just a bit run down. Perhaps a good holiday is all I need. Somewhere warm.
DOCTOR: While a holiday would be pleasant, Mr. Redfern, we should rule out any underlying medical causes before attributing this to simply being “run down.” Let's move on to this feeling of being "floppy." Could you describe that sensation in more detail?
PATIENT: Right, well... it's not like I'm collapsing or anything. It's more... a lack of… springiness, I suppose? Like all my muscles are a bit… loose. It's hard to explain. Especially in my back. Bending over instruments all day, like I said. It’s not painful, just… weak. And sometimes my hands feel a bit clumsy. Not enough to affect my work, mind you. But noticeable. Used to be able to do things with such precision. Now... not quite.
DOCTOR: “Clumsiness” and muscle weakness… and the non-restorative sleep. Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Be gentle, Doctor. I'm not as spry as I used to be. Although, I suspect that's just age. Though, as we’ve established, that's probably not the issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are… present, but slightly diminished. Now, let's check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels a bit weaker than it used to, honestly. Not that I'm complaining. Just… observing. A bit stiff, too, sometimes. Mostly in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright, bending forward… any pain with that?
PATIENT: No, not pain exactly. Just… a bit of a pull. It’s always been a bit stiff, like I said. It's nothing a good stretch wouldn't fix, probably. Honestly, I suspect I just need to be more active. It’s easy to get caught up in work, you see. Long hours in the shop…not much time for exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to rule a few things out, I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, vitamin D level, and thyroid function tests. Also, I'd like to get a urine sample. That will help us see if there's anything underlying causing these symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Right. Yes, alright. Sounds…thorough. I suppose it’s best to be sure. Urine sample, too? Very well. Though honestly, I still think it's just a bit of fatigue. But, if you insist, Doctor. I’ll try not to overthink it. When do I need to come back with the samples?
DOCTOR: You can go to the lab across the hall anytime tomorrow. They’re open 8 am to 5 pm. Fasting for 12 hours before the blood draw is important. And you’ll need to collect a midstream urine sample. The lab staff will provide instructions for that. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It will probably be in about a week. In the meantime, try to get some extra rest, if possible. And if anything worsens – increased weakness, severe pain, difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Understood?
PATIENT: Right. Tomorrow. Fasting. Midstream urine. Got it. A week for the results. And… emergency room if anything gets worse. Yes, alright. It all sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? Though, I'm sure it's nothing. Just a bit of run-down-ness, probably. Thank you, Doctor. I'll get those samples done tomorrow. And I'll try to… rest. Though I'm not very good at that. .
