DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… a rather long story. And frankly, I haven’t much time for stories these days. It’s the… the university. The students. It’s just… exhausting. I teach library science, you understand. Not exactly a glamorous profession anymore. It’s all… digital now. A waste, if you ask me. I suppose you want details, but I confess, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed with your work at the university. We can definitely take it slow and focus on what’s most concerning to you right now. It’s perfectly alright if details are difficult to recall – we'll work through it together. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me specifically what is exhausting about it?
PATIENT: Specifics… Honestly? The students. They simply don’t appreciate the value of a well-indexed card catalogue anymore. They want everything handed to them, instantly. And the… the administration. Always changing things. New software, new protocols… It’s utterly ridiculous. They don’t understand the fundamentals. It’s all… superficial. And it's simply… draining. I used to enjoy my work, you know. Now it’s just… a job. A necessary evil, sadly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the changes at the university, the students’ expectations, and the administrative demands are contributing to how you’re feeling. It sounds like a significant shift from how things used to be, and understandably frustrating. Beyond the frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this feeling of being drained?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Oh, you mean like… aches and pains? Naturally. I’m eighty-seven years old, Doctor. What do you expect? A few twinges here and there. Nothing worth mentioning. Just… general wear and tear. It’s the mental strain that's the issue. The constant… irritation. The feeling of being… undervalued. Really, it's a complete waste of my expertise. Honestly, I haven't been sleeping well, if that counts. But that's probably just… age.
DOCTOR: I understand. While aches and pains are common at 87, the sleep disturbance is worth mentioning, Mr. Schlatterer. It can often be connected to stress and feelings of frustration, as you’ve described. Can you tell me a little more about the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Well, what is there to tell? I simply… lie awake. Thinking. About the university, mostly. About the… decline of Western civilization. About the students. It's a vicious cycle, you see. I toss and turn, and then I'm simply exhausted the next day. Not that anyone cares. I used to be a very sound sleeper. But now… it’s all… fragmented. A few hours here, a few hours there. And I wake up feeling… unrefreshed. Utterly, utterly unrefreshed. Honestly, it’s quite demoralizing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. Fragmented sleep and waking feeling unrefreshed sounds very disruptive. It’s good you’re sharing this with me. To get a better picture, would you say this has been a recent change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It didn’t happen overnight. It started… after the new dean arrived. He’s a very… modern man. Full of… ideas. Mostly bad ones. He implemented all sorts of changes. New software, new curriculum... it was all quite unsettling. And then, the students became even more… demanding. So, it’s been a slow decline. Perhaps six months ago, it started becoming truly problematic. Before that, it was just… occasional restlessness. Now, it’s almost… every night. Honestly, it’s… tedious. Terribly tedious.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, coinciding with the arrival of the new dean and the changes at the university... that’s helpful information. It certainly sounds like there’s a connection there. Now, Mr. Schlatterer, outside of the sleep disturbance and feeling drained, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Appetite? Honestly, who has an appetite these days? Everything is so… processed. And weight… well, I’ve always been rather… slight. My wife used to worry about it, but she’s gone now. As for energy levels… what energy levels? I’m eighty-seven years old, Doctor! I have some energy, naturally, but it’s mostly used for… complaining, I suppose. I haven’t noticed any dramatic changes. Just… a general feeling of… depletion. Honestly, I find myself napping more. During the day. Which is… undignified. Terribly undignified. But what choice do I have? It’s exhausting just thinking about all the things that need to be done.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're carrying a lot, Mr. Schlatterer – the stress from the university changes, the loss of your wife, and the general challenges that come with age. The napping could be a sign that your body is needing extra rest, and it’s certainly okay to rest when you need to. Before we move on, could you tell me if you are currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I’ve always been very careful about putting things into my body. Never been much of a pill-popper, you see. A little chamomile tea before bed, perhaps. But that’s it. Absolutely no prescription drugs. And supplements? Utter nonsense. Just another way for people to… profit from other people’s anxieties. No, Doctor, I rely on… willpower. And the occasional strong cup of coffee. That’s it. Honestly, the idea of filling my body with… chemicals… it’s quite appalling. Terribly appalling.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Schlatterer. So, no medications or supplements, just chamomile tea and coffee. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, do you really need to know all this? It's all rather… tedious, isn’t it? Well, let me think… I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago. When I was teaching in Sofia, actually. And a rather nasty case of shingles a few years back. But other than that… nothing significant. My wife always handled all the medical appointments, you see. She was very… meticulous. I suppose I have slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing to write home about. Honestly, it's probably just the stress. And… the coffee. Yes, the coffee. Everything is always the coffee. Honestly, I’m not much of a patient. I much prefer being the… educator. Do you understand? This is all terribly inefficient.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’ve had a relatively healthy life, despite the pneumonia and shingles. And I appreciate you sharing the information about the slightly elevated blood pressure, even if it’s just a suspicion. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. A rather alarming experience, actually. And… I think I had a cataract removed from my left eye a few years back. But that’s it. Nothing major. My wife arranged everything, of course. She was very… practical. Honestly, I try not to dwell on such… unpleasant matters. It’s much more productive to focus on… intellectual pursuits. Do you understand? This is all quite… tiresome. I feel quite… drained, actually. Perhaps we should conclude this interview? I have a rather important article to… review.
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling drained, Mr. Schlatterer, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. We are almost finished. Just a few more questions. Now, concerning your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, who keeps track of such things? My parents are both… gone now. A long time ago. My mother… she had something with her… digestion, I believe. And my father… he was a very… stoic man. Never complained about anything. I vaguely recall something about his… heart, perhaps. But honestly, it’s all so… distant. And frankly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. I understand you’re trying to do your job, but I simply don’t have the capacity to… delve into the past. It's all terribly… exhausting. Perhaps we should conclude this interview now? I really must get back to my article. It's a rather important topic. And frankly, I feel quite… depleted. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize if my questions are causing you distress, and I respect your desire to conclude the interview. It sounds like you’re feeling quite overwhelmed, and it’s perfectly alright to stop when you need to. Just one last question, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
