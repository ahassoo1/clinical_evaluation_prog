DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... about the cancer. I was told to come talk to you. It's been... hard.
DOCTOR: "Cancer," you say. Right. Well, that is a rather broad term, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I… I don't really know much about it, to be honest. Just that it’s what my husband… what took him. And now… they said I have it too. I’m sorry, I'm not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Luft. It’s understandable to be…discomposed. Now, who informed you of this diagnosis?
PATIENT: Um… Doctor Ramirez. At the hospital. She did some tests… and then she told me. She said I needed to see an… a specialist. Like you. She gave me a paper with the results, but… I haven’t really looked at it closely. It scared me too much.
DOCTOR: Doctor Ramirez, alright. Let me pull up her report here… Yes, I see it now. Before we delve into the specifics, could you tell me what prompted those tests in the first place?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been really tired. For a long time, now. And I lost some weight without trying. I just… didn't have much appetite, I guess. Then my stomach started hurting. Not all the time, but enough that it bothered me. That's why I went to Doctor Ramirez, to begin with.
DOCTOR: "Tiredness," and "loss of appetite." Common complaints, Ms. Luft, quite common. And stomach pain… could be anything. Now, can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say. It’s not sharp, exactly. More like a dull ache, most of the time. It’s higher up, in my stomach. And it feels worse after I eat. Sometimes it goes into my back, a little. I’m sorry, I know this isn't very helpful.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, higher up, worse after eating…radiating to the back. Alright. And how long have you been experiencing this pain, specifically?
PATIENT: Maybe… three or four months, now? It started small, and I thought it was just something I ate. But it kept getting worse, slowly. That’s when I decided to see the doctor. I didn't think it would be… this.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And you mentioned weight loss. Approximately how much weight have you lost, if you have any idea?
PATIENT: Oh… I don’t know exactly. Maybe fifteen pounds? I used to weigh 127, and now… I think I'm around 112. I haven't really been weighing myself much lately. It just… upsets me.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds over four months, that is notable. Now, let's move onto some more general questions. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I get a little… breathless sometimes, when I walk upstairs. But I figured that was just because I'm tired. And… I haven’t been sleeping very well. Just… worrying, I guess. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, insomnia…caused by worry, you say. A convenient explanation. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else, Ms. Luft?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. Except… when I had my appendix out when I was a kid. But that was a long time ago. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Until… well, until now.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, childhood. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. None that I know of. I can take most things. My husband was the one with allergies, actually. He was allergic to penicillin. But I'm fine. I haven't had to take much medicine, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Luft?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. A multivitamin, and vitamin D. Doctor Ramirez said I was a little low on vitamin D when she did the blood work. That’s all. Really. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Vitamins. Of course. Now, before we proceed further, I must ask about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Yes... my mother had breast cancer. A long time ago. She… she beat it, though. But… my husband’s grandfather died of lung cancer. He smoked for years. That’s why I was so scared when Doctor Ramirez said… this. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Maternal breast cancer history, paternal grandfather with lung cancer. Smoking history significant. Yes, Ms. Luft, it is... relevant. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. My husband… he tried to quit a few times, but… he couldn't. He smoked for almost forty years. I always told him it would kill him. I… I didn't mean for it to, though. I just wanted him to be healthy.
DOCTOR: I see. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night. Maybe two or three times a week. It helps me relax. My husband liked a beer, but... not much anymore. Not since... well. I don't drink much, I promise.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. Now, let us proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It will be a brief, but necessary, assessment.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It should not, Ms. Luft. However, please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. If you could lie supine, please. I'll begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs. Take deep breaths for me, if you would. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, I need to examine your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Not really... well, maybe a little on the left side. It's just… a dull ache, like I said. It's not sharp, and it doesn't hurt when you touch it, but it's… there. It's hard to explain. It feels… swollen, maybe? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Swollen, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It’s… it’s not a big swelling, but it feels different than usual. More… hard. And a little tender. It’s higher up, on the left side, like I said. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: There is palpable mass in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, approximately 8 centimeters in diameter. It is firm, non-tender to light palpation, but elicits discomfort with deep pressure. No rebound tenderness or guarding. We will need to order some imaging studies to determine the nature of this mass. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is necessary. Also, repeat complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. I also recommend a tumor marker panel, specifically CA-125 and CEA. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: A… a mass? That sounds… bad. What does that mean? And… what are all those tests? I… I don’t understand. Is it cancer?
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, I understand your apprehension. A "mass" simply indicates an abnormal growth. It does not automatically equate to cancer. The imaging studies and blood tests will help us determine the nature of this growth. A CT scan will provide detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to assess the size, location, and characteristics of the mass. The blood tests will measure certain substances in your blood that can be indicative of cancer. As for the tumor markers, CA-125 and CEA, these are proteins that can be elevated in certain types of cancer, though elevation does not confirm malignancy. These tests are preliminary and provide further information. I will also be referring you to an oncologist, Dr. Moreau, for a comprehensive evaluation and further management. It is crucial to have a specialist's opinion in this matter. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… you don’t know if it’s cancer yet? You need more tests to find out? And I have to see another doctor? I… I don’t know if I can handle this. It's all so much. What if it is cancer? My husband…
DOCTOR: Ms. Luft, it is perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. As I stated, we do not have a definitive diagnosis at this time. The tests are necessary to determine the nature of this mass and guide appropriate treatment. Seeing an oncologist is standard protocol in these situations. They are specialists in cancer care and can provide a comprehensive evaluation and discuss all available treatment options if necessary. I can assure you, we will proceed with a methodical and diligent approach. We will gather all the necessary information, assess the risks and benefits, and formulate the best possible plan of care. The referral to Dr. Moreau will be expedited. I will also arrange for a social worker to contact you to provide emotional support and assist with logistical matters. Do you have any immediate questions regarding the referral process or the scheduled tests?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… when will I hear about the tests? And how long does it take to see Dr. Moreau? I just… I need to know something. .
DOCTOR: The CT scan can be scheduled as early as tomorrow. You will receive a call from the radiology department to confirm the appointment. The results will typically be available within 24-48 hours of the scan. I will review them with you as soon as they are available. Regarding Dr. Moreau, I have already submitted the referral. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Given her schedule, it may take approximately one to two weeks. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. A member of my clinical staff will be contacting you in the next 24-48 hours to verify appointment details and address any immediate concerns. Do you have any further questions before you leave today, Ms. Luft?
