DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s my speech, I believe. It’s been… a bit off, lately. I don’t really know how off, exactly. It just feels… harder to say things clearly, sometimes. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "A bit off" and harder to say things clearly. That's a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice? That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t sudden, not that I recall. It’s been… gradual, I think? Maybe a few weeks? Perhaps longer? Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't the best. It feels like it’s been building for a little while, but pinpointing a date… I couldn’t say for sure.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, that's perfectly alright. "A little while" is helpful. And it's good you recognize it's been gradual. Now, can you describe how your speech feels different?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like my tongue feels… heavy, sometimes. Or slow. And the words… they don’t always come out right. Like I know what I want to say, but it’s like… a muddle before it gets to my mouth. And sometimes… it just sounds slurred, I guess. Not all the time, but often enough to notice. It’s a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heavy, slow, a muddle, and sometimes slurred. That gives me a better picture. Does this happen all the time, or are there specific times of day or situations when it's worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think it’s constant. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, definitely. Long days at work… it’s much more noticeable then. And… if I’m speaking quickly, trying to get a lot out at once. When I slow down and focus, it’s a bit better, but… it’s still there. I haven’t really noticed it being better at any particular time, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Worse with fatigue and when speaking quickly. Okay. And what kind of work do you do, Adyn?
PATIENT: I’m a Construction Manager, Doctor. It's a busy job, a lot of being on site, coordinating things, talking to people… keeping everything running smoothly. It’s physical work, too, a lot of walking and being outdoors. It’s… demanding. It can be quite stressful at times, too, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a demanding and stressful job. That's good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Um… not that I’ve specifically noticed, no. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, naturally, with work being busy, but I just put that down to the long hours. And… I’ve had a couple of headaches, but nothing major. Just the usual kind, I suppose. I haven’t noticed anything else… not that I can recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. No major headaches, just usual kind, and increased fatigue related to work. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Um, I don’t believe so, Doctor. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but they haven't mentioned anything of concern. My husband usually handles all the paperwork, so I’m not always entirely sure what they say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you have regular check-ups with Medicare. That's good. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never had any need for surgery, thankfully. Nothing like that. I’ve broken a bone or two as a child, a wrist and an arm, but those healed up fine. No major operations, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. How about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Um, my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart, I think. It was a long time ago, though. I don’t really know much about it. My husband’s family are… healthier, generally. Nothing major that I’m aware of. I’m not very close to them, so we don’t really discuss medical things.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with high blood pressure, grandfather with heart issues. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medication. I’ve had antibiotics a few times for infections, and painkillers for headaches, but nothing ever caused any issues. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything, but I can’t say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm not taking any medications at all. Nothing prescribed, nothing over-the-counter, nothing. Just… the usual things, if I have a headache – a couple of paracetamol, maybe. But I don’t take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Thank you for that information, Adyn. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay. Your ears, nose, and throat look normal. Your eye movements are full and equal. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your grip strength is good. I'm listening to your lungs and heart now... they sound clear. I'm also noticing a slight weakness on the left side of your face when you smile. It’s subtle, but I can see it. Can you try and hold a piece of paper against your cheeks while I gently push on them?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I’m not sure what I’m looking for… Is it… supposed to feel different? Because it feels the same on both sides. It’s just… paper, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're doing perfectly. And that's what I was looking for. On the left side, the paper moves more easily than on the right when I apply pressure. It's a subtle difference, but it’s there. This, along with the slight weakness I noticed when you smiled, is concerning. It’s too early to say for certain, but these findings could indicate some mild facial nerve weakness. This could be caused by a number of things, including a viral infection, inflammation, or, less commonly, something more serious. I want to be thorough, so I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh… um… what kind of tests, Doctor? I wasn’t expecting… anything serious. Is it… bad? I feel a bit anxious now. Viral infection… that sounds… unpleasant. And “less commonly something more serious” doesn’t sound very good at all. What do you recommend?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Adyn, and I apologize for causing it. It’s good you’re voicing your concerns. It’s important to remember that it’s most likely a minor issue, such as a viral infection. The "less commonly something more serious" is just me being thorough and covering all bases. It's standard practice. The tests I’m recommending are an MRI of your brain, just to rule out anything structural, and a blood test to check for inflammation or infection. The MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain and facial nerves. The blood test will help us determine if there's an underlying cause. Would you be comfortable proceeding with those tests?
PATIENT: MRI… and a blood test. Okay. Um… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. It sounds a bit… frightening, honestly, but I trust your judgement. When would I have these tests done? And… will it hurt? Will the results take long? I have work, you see… I don’t want to worry my employer unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to answer them. The MRI is painless, it uses magnetic waves to create an image. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie still for about 30-45 minutes, but it’s not harmful. The blood test is just a simple needle prick. We can schedule the MRI for as soon as possible, likely within the next few days. I’ll have my assistant arrange it for you. The blood test can be done today, if you’re comfortable. The results usually take 24-48 hours. We can discuss them at a follow-up appointment then. Regarding work, you don’t need to tell your employer anything yet. We'll know more after the tests. If it turns out to be something serious, we can discuss a medical note then. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable. Today for the blood test, and soon for the MRI. And I don't need to tell my employer yet. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. Will the MRI require any… preparation? Should I avoid anything before the test? And… what if it is something serious? What are the… options? I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but I'm very anxious.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Adyn. It’s good you’re being proactive and informed. Regarding the MRI, there’s no special preparation needed. Just let the technician know if you have any metal implants, like a pacemaker or surgical clips. Otherwise, you can eat and drink normally. As for what if it is something serious… that's difficult to say without knowing the cause. The options would depend entirely on the diagnosis. It could range from medication to physical therapy to, in rare cases, surgery. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll have a clearer picture once we have the test results. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done, and then we can discuss everything in more detail. My assistant will come in shortly to schedule the tests and draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You've been very patient with me. I suppose I’ll just… wait for your assistant then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if any other questions come to mind. I’ll have my assistant come in now. Just relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time.
