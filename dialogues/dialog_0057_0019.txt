DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmmm… what brings me… Oh yes! My wife and I… we thinking maybe… a baby? We are… old. But we want to try. It’s a little… complicated. I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, I understand. You and your wife are considering trying to have a baby. That’s wonderful, and it’s good you’re thinking things through. You mentioned you and your wife are… older, and that you sometimes have trouble remembering things. That’s perfectly alright; we can certainly discuss that. Just to be clear, when you say “older,” how old is your wife, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh… she is… Let me see… she just had a birthday. Yes! Sixty-two, I think. Yes, sixty-two. And I am… seventy. We been married a long time. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That’s helpful. Sixty-two and seventy, a very long marriage indeed! Now, before we talk about trying to conceive, it’s important we discuss a few things to make sure this is as safe as possible for both of you. First, have either of you ever been evaluated for fertility before?
PATIENT: Fertility… I don't think so. No… not that I recall. We just… always used protection before. This is… new. My wife, she wants this very much. I want to make her happy. We didn't think about… doctors and things before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's never too late to consider these things. Since this is new territory for both of you, we’ll want to do a thorough evaluation. To start, could you tell me a bit about your wife’s overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm… she is… okay, I think. She goes to the doctor… sometimes. For her blood pressure. It goes up and down. And… … she has a little trouble with her knees. Old age, you know? But she is strong. She still cooks and cleans. She is a very good wife. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: That does help, Mr. Carlotta, thank you. Knowing about her blood pressure and knee trouble is important. Do you know if her blood pressure is currently well-controlled with medication?
PATIENT: Medication… I think so… yes. She takes a little pill every morning. White pill, I believe. And sometimes a different one if it gets too high. The doctor tells her what to do. I don’t remember the names. My wife handles all that. I just… make sure she takes it.
DOCTOR: That's good that she’s managing her blood pressure. And it’s wonderful you support her in taking her medications. Now, let's talk about your health, Mr. Carlotta. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Me? No… not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… old age, you know? And my hands… they shake a little. But the doctor said it's nothing to worry about. He said it’s just my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tiredness and some hand tremors. And you mentioned seeing a doctor about the tremors before. Do you know what the doctor diagnosed that as, or what, if anything, he recommended?
PATIENT: Hmm… Something about… essential tremor, maybe? Yes, I think that was it. He said it runs in my family. He said there isn’t much you can do about it. Just… try not to stress. He didn’t give me any medicine or anything. Just told me to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, essential tremor. That's helpful information. Now, have either of you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… My wife had her gallbladder out, a long time ago. Very long ago. I… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it.
DOCTOR: Okay, your wife had her gallbladder removed and you had your appendix out many years ago. Do either of you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No… not that I know of. My wife… maybe a little trouble with shellfish. Makes her stomach upset sometimes. But it's not a bad allergy. Just makes her feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, just some sensitivity to shellfish for your wife. Now, are either of you currently taking any medications, aside from the ones you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Oh! I take a little pill for my… what’s it called? For my water. Makes me go to the bathroom more. The doctor gave it to me last year. My wife takes something for her arthritis in her hands. Makes them less sore, she says.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for your prostate and something for your wife’s arthritis. We're getting a good picture here. Before we move on, Mr. Carlotta, I want to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear… That’s a hard one. So many people… My mother, she had… problems with her heart. I think. And my father… he got sick. A long time ago. Something with his lungs. My wife's side… her brother had diabetes. Yes, that’s right. And her aunt had… something with her breast. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Heart problems on your mother’s side, lung issues on your father’s side, and diabetes and a history of breast cancer on your wife’s side. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I want to briefly discuss some lifestyle factors. Do either of you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. My wife neither. Alcohol… sometimes, a little glass of wine with dinner. Very little. No drugs. Never used drugs. We are old people. We don’t do things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, we've covered a lot of important information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need. I want to make my wife happy, and if this helps, then I’m happy too.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you don’t mind, could you please have a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. This will just take a few minutes. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Your breathing sounds a little… wheezy, but not alarming. Your blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and stress. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some slight tenderness in the lower quadrants. Anything painful when I press here?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little. Just a little. It's nothing much. I get cramps sometimes. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just some mild tenderness. Now, let's check your pulse and reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure could use some attention, and the tenderness in your abdomen warrants further investigation. I recommend we order some blood work and a urine sample to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. If it helps my wife and me… then yes. Blood work and… urine? That’s fine.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse draw some blood and collect a urine sample. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, given your age and the desire to start a family, I also recommend a consultation with a reproductive specialist. They can provide expert guidance on the potential risks and benefits, and help you make informed decisions. Would you like me to make a referral for you?
PATIENT: A specialist? Hmm… Yes, I think so. If you think it’s best. My wife… she will be very happy. Yes, please. A referral. Whatever helps us have a baby.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected reproductive specialist in the area. They are very experienced with couples in your situation. Now, before we finish, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… not right now, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. I trust your judgement, Doctor. My wife will probably have lots of questions later. Thank you for your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m happy to help. I’m confident we can explore all your options and make the best decision for you and your wife. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood and urine sample. In the meantime, if you have any questions that come to mind, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you and your wife all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything. Goodbye.
