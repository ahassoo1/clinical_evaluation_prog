DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Guilds, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Oreste Guilds. Though most folks just call me… well, I forget what most folks call me these days. Old age, you know? What’s all this about anyway? I ain’t felt too bad… just a little… dry.
DOCTOR: “A little dry.” Right. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean? Like… everywhere? My mouth feels like sandpaper, and my eyes… itchy. Like I been starin’ at the sun too long, but I ain’t been doin’ that. It just… happened. Slowly, I think. Hard to remember things clear these days. You a real doctor? You look kinda young. No offense.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I am a doctor. Thirteen years experience in Internal Medicine. And yes, I am relatively young. It’s… irrelevant. So, this dryness – is it just your mouth and eyes, or are you experiencing it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Internal Medicine, huh? Well, alright. Doesn’t change the fact I feel like a prune. Just the mouth and eyes, I think. Maybe… my nose too? It feels kinda stuffy sometimes. But I get that a lot, with the… weather. This heat ain’t helpin’, I can tell ya that much. It’s awful. Back in Cuba… well, never mind. It was different.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mouth, eyes, and sometimes a stuffy nose. And this has been developing… slowly?
PATIENT: Slowly… yeah. Weeks, maybe? Months? It all kinda blurs together. I ain’t been keepin’ track. I mostly just try to drink enough water. Doesn’t seem to help much, though. You think it’s serious? I ain’t one for fussin’ over nothin’. I worked traffic control for fifty years, rain or shine. A little dryness ain't gonna kill me.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “a little dryness” can be indicative of several things. It's important to rule out anything serious. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kinda symptoms? I feel… tired, I guess. Old age, right? Everyone gets tired when they get old. And I cough a little, sometimes. Just a tickle in my throat. Nothing bad. I used to smoke cigars, you know. Years ago, though. Quit when I came here. This country… too expensive for good cigars.
DOCTOR: You mentioned a history of cigar smoking. How long ago did you quit, and how much did you smoke beforehand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. Maybe thirty years? Forty? I don’t rightly remember. I used to smoke… a lot. Two or three a day, maybe? Sometimes more when I was stressin’ over traffic. Always the good ones, too. Dominican. Now they want a fortune for ‘em. Stopped cold turkey, though. Didn’t see the point in stickin’ around for the price of ‘em. Besides, my wife… she didn’t like ‘em. She’s gone now, though. Long time gone. I forget… how long? This is gettin’ depressing.
DOCTOR: We'll come back to that if necessary. Let's focus on the present. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been one for sniffles or rashes. I get bit by mosquitoes, same as anyone else. But that ain’t an allergy, is it? Just… mosquitoes. Pesky little things. Back in Cuba, we had those no-see-ums. Those were bad. Tiny little monsters. This country's got plenty of bugs, too, though. Especially in the summer. Makes you wanna stay inside.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm… Let me think. The doctor gave me somethin’ for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. Take it every mornin’, I think. And somethin’ for my… joints? They ache sometimes. That one's yellow, maybe? Honestly, doc, I got so many pills, I just take what the wife used to give me. She kept track of everything. Now… I just guess. Medicare sends me a bunch of stuff, too. I ain't sure what half of it is for. It's all a mess. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we need to get this sorted out. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, and then we'll try to figure out what's going on. Can you please sit up and let me listen to your lungs?
