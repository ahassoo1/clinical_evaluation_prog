DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Sink. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Sink. It’s nice to meet you too. I've been getting these headaches, right in the back of my head. They come and go, but lately they’ve been… more frequent, I guess you’d say. It's been going on for a couple weeks now, maybe three. Not sure exactly. It feels like a tight band around my head, mostly.
DOCTOR: Headaches, alright. Frequent for two or three weeks... Hmm. And is this… new for you, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: Yes, it is pretty new. I get little aches here and there, you know, like anyone does. But nothing like this. Usually it’s from working in the garden, bending over, but this… this happens even when I’m just sitting and reading. It’s a little worrying, to be honest. I usually just tough things out, but this isn’t going away.
DOCTOR: Right. “Toughing things out” isn't always the best approach, especially at your age. Any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no blurry vision, no dizziness. Just… the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, now that I think about it. Not awful, just… tighter than usual. And I haven’t been sleeping as well lately, but that could be a lot of things. Old age, right?
DOCTOR: “Old age” is rarely a diagnosis, Mr. Gibbel. Still, good you mentioned the neck stiffness. Let’s see… have you noticed anything that makes the headache worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Thinking about it… bright lights seem to bother it a little. And if I’m looking at a screen for too long, it definitely gets worse. Not immediately, but after a while. I’ve been trying to limit my screen time, though. My daughter keeps telling me I should. She says it's bad for my eyes, too. And like I said, the reading, too. It's frustrating, because I love to read.
DOCTOR: Bright lights, screen time, reading… Alright. Any nausea or vomiting associated with the headaches?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. Nothing like that at all. Just the pain, and the stiffness. It's mostly a dull ache, really. Not a throbbing, sharp pain, if that makes sense. More like… pressure? Like someone is squeezing my head. It just makes it hard to concentrate. I worry about forgetting things, you know? I try to keep my mind sharp, but this headache doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a little ache, but that's it. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. My wife… my ex-wife, used to always say I was too stubborn to take pills. But truly, just aspirin when needed. Nothing else. I haven't seen a doctor in… well, a long time, honestly. I just figured this would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mr. Gibbel?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Food, medicine, nothing. My daughter always asks when I see a new doctor, but I always tell her the same thing. I eat pretty much anything. I used to help my mother with the garden, and she grew all sorts of things. She knew all about herbs and plants… things that could help with anything, she said. But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam, Mr. Gibbel. Just standard neurological check, blood pressure, things like that. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me… There we go. Still getting used to these old bones, you know? I used to be able to jump around like a grasshopper, but those days are long gone. Do you want me to take off my shoes?
DOCTOR: No, no need to remove your shoes. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A bit elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head… left, right, up, down…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Doing as you say. Left, right, up, down... Is that okay? It feels a little stiff looking up.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. It's to be expected. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Two plus. Normal. And squeeze my hands. Hard as you can… Normal grip strength. Now, can you stand up and walk for me a few steps?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. One, two, three… Is that alright? I try to keep moving, you know? My daughter says sitting around is the worst thing for me.
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly slow, but stable. No noticeable balance issues. Alright. Based on this brief examination, it could be tension headaches. The neck stiffness, the stress…it fits. But given your age and the recent change in frequency, I want to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And I'd like a CT scan of your head, just to be safe. We need to rule out anything structural.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh. Is that… is that serious, Doctor? What are you looking for? I just thought it was a headache… I don’t like the sound of a scan. Is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. I try to keep things simple. It's just… my daughter, she always worries. She'll be asking a lot of questions, I can tell you that.
DOCTOR: It's a precaution, Mr. Gibbel. A precaution. We are looking for anything that might be causing the headache – a small bleed, a tumor, anything that wouldn't show up on a physical exam. It’s standard procedure, and frankly, given your age and the change in your symptoms, I’d be remiss not to order one. As for cost… yes, it will be expensive. I can write a referral to the clinic’s financial assistance department. They can explore options with you. But delaying a diagnosis because of cost could be… problematic. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, just for a second opinion. We need to get this figured out, Mr. Gibbel. Your daughter's concerns are valid.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. A neurologist, too… It sounds like a lot. I just… I didn't expect all of this from a headache. I guess you’re right, though. I should probably get it checked out properly. Okay. Do what you think is best, Doctor. I'll see about the financial assistance… and the neurologist. My daughter will be glad to hear that, at least. When can I expect the results? And… will it hurt? The scan, I mean.
DOCTOR: The scan is painless, Mr. Gibbel. You'll lie flat on a table, and the machine will take images. The radiology department will schedule the appointment. As for the results… it usually takes 24-48 hours. I’ll have the radiology department send them to me, and then my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. Here are the referrals and the paperwork for the blood work. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That’s… a lot to take in. Thank you. I'll… I'll talk to my daughter about it. And I'll get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thank you for your time, Doctor Sink. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
