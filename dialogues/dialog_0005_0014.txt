DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Donate, is it? Yes, good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s about some papers, I think. My wife, she says I need something… for work. Something about leave? Or… maybe it’s disability? I get a little mixed up these days. It has to do with… time off, I believe. Something official.
DOCTOR: Right. Papers… time off… disability. Okay. So, it sounds like you're not necessarily feeling unwell, but your wife feels you need documentation from a doctor for some work-related reason?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say I’m feeling bad, no. Just… tired, a lot. And… things don’t come as easy as they used to, you know? But sick? No, not really. My wife… she worries. She handles most of the… details. She said something about FMLA… does that ring a bell? I’m not good with these… forms and things.
DOCTOR: FMLA… yes, the Family and Medical Leave Act. That’s a possibility. Okay, Mr. Limtiaco. So, you're experiencing fatigue and some difficulty with things you used to do easily. To be clear, this is not because of a specific illness you’re aware of, but a gradual change in your overall energy levels and cognitive function?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right, Doctor. A gradual change. That’s a good way to put it. It’s not like I woke up one day feeling awful. It’s just… little things. Forgetting where I put my keys, needing a nap after… well, after not much at all, really. And… sometimes the words don’t come as quick as they used to. My wife says it’s probably time to… you know… get it checked out. She’s very thorough, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it’s good your wife is proactive. We certainly can document these changes for FMLA purposes. But before we just fill out paperwork, I do want to get a little more information, just to rule out anything easily addressable. We'll do a basic physical exam and talk a bit about your history. Let's start with this fatigue – has this been worsening gradually, or has there been a specific point where you noticed a significant change?
PATIENT: Hmm… a specific point… that's a tricky one. I think… maybe around last Christmas? Or maybe Thanksgiving? It all sort of blends together after a while, you know? But I remember feeling particularly… drained around the holidays. Lots of visitors, lots of… doing. And it just… didn’t bounce back like it used to. I used to be able to power through anything, but then I'd need a whole week to recover. It’s been… slowly getting worse since then, I suppose. But I can't pinpoint one day.
DOCTOR: Okay, around the holidays… a gradual decline since then. And this fatigue… does it improve with rest?
PATIENT: Well… not really, not completely. I can sleep, and it helps a little, but I still wake up feeling… not refreshed, you know? Like I haven’t really slept. And it doesn’t last long. A few hours, maybe, and then the tiredness creeps back in. It's frustrating. My wife keeps telling me to slow down, but… I have things to do! Things to oversee at the church… and… oh, dear, what was I saying?
DOCTOR: You were saying you have things to oversee at the church. That’s fine. And you feel the fatigue doesn't improve significantly even with rest. Now, let's talk about these difficulties with words – can you give me an example of what you mean?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the words… It’s… like they're on the tip of my tongue, you know? I know what I want to say, but it takes me a long time to… find the right ones. Or… I’ll be talking and… suddenly forget what I was talking about, mid-sentence! Like just now, with the church… I was going to say something about… the choir practice schedule… or… maybe it was the fundraiser? Oh, dear. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. It happens more and more often. My wife has to finish my sentences sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Difficulty finding words, losing your train of thought… happening more frequently. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you a few general questions about your health. Have you noticed any memory problems aside from this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Memory problems… hmm. That’s a good question. I do… misplace things more often, like my glasses, or my wallet. And sometimes I have trouble remembering… names. Not important names, usually, just… people I’ve met once or twice. And I sometimes walk into a room and… forget why I went in there! It’s silly, really. Little things, but… I’ve noticed it. I'm sure I've always been a little forgetful, but it feels… worse now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Misplacing things, difficulty remembering names… Okay. Let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a quick neurological assessment - just a few simple tests to assess your balance, reflexes, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please don’t rush me too much. I get a little… flustered when people are hurried. And… I might need a little help getting up from the chair afterwards. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing is normal. Now, I'm going to have you stand up slowly, if you're able. Okay. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Alright… easy does it. There… a little wobbly, but… I’m alright. My knees are a bit stiff this morning. It’s the weather, I think. Damp air always gets to them. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Back when I was… younger.
DOCTOR: Now, can you close your eyes and hold your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Alright… like this? It’s a little difficult to keep them steady. I can feel them… shaking a little. Is that bad? I’m not very good at… balancing things, even when I’m not moving. My wife always said I was all thumbs.
DOCTOR: Okay, you can sit back down now. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees with this little hammer. Reflexes are… somewhat diminished, but not absent. It’s not alarming, but it's something we’ll note. Overall, your neurological exam is… subtly abnormal. Mr. Limtiaco, based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, I’m concerned about some possible cognitive decline. It’s not necessarily anything serious yet, but we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this – things like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation – possibly including some cognitive testing and brain imaging. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? Oh, dear. That sounds… frightening. Brain imaging? Is that… serious? I… I don’t know. My wife… she’s the one who would know what to do. She always worries about these things. But… if you think it’s necessary… yes, I suppose so. Blood work… that’s not so bad. And a neurologist… I’ll need her to schedule that. I get confused with appointments and things. Yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please don’t tell my wife too much until we have some answers. She’ll… she’ll worry herself sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed cautiously, as you wish. I'll order the blood work now, and I’ll provide you with a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist I trust. I’ll also give you a list of questions you might want to ask her. As for telling your wife, that's entirely your decision. I understand your concerns, and we'll respect your wishes. We'll focus on gathering information first. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I don’t think so. I need to… process everything. It’s a lot to take in. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… for not dismissing me. And for being patient. My wife would want me to ask… about the cause? Is it something… I did? Something I can fix? But I think that's enough questions for now. Just… the blood work and the neurologist. Yes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's understandable to be overwhelmed. As for the cause, there are many possibilities, and it's too early to say. It’s rarely a simple answer. We’ll get a clearer picture once we have the blood work results and Dr. Reed’s assessment. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks to discuss everything. Here are the lab requisitions and the neurologist’s contact information. Please contact the lab to schedule your blood work and call Dr. Reed's office to make an appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Mr. Limtiaco, and try not to worry too much. We’ll figure this out.
PATIENT: .
