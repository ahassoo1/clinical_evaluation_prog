DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… my head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting a few days now. Not… real bad, but it’s there. Like a dull ache, you know? Not like a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: A dull ache at the back of your head, for a few days now. I see. And would you describe it as constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Mostly when I… when I stand up too fast. Or if I bend over. And sometimes… just happens. Not all the time, though. Most of the day I don’t even notice it, really. But when I do, it’s… annoying.
DOCTOR: So, it's triggered by changes in position – standing quickly, bending over. And it’s not consistently present. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. No. Maybe… being tired makes it worse. Yes, definitely tired. When I don’t sleep good, it’s worse for sure. Better… when I sit still, I guess. Just… relaxing. Nothing special makes it go away quick, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned not sleeping well. How many hours of sleep are you typically getting each night, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Oh, not enough. Maybe… five, six hours? Something like that. Used to sleep much better, but… well, I’m an old man now. Things change, you know? I wake up a lot, too. Not a deep sleep, like it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Five or six hours, and not restful sleep. And has this change in your sleep pattern coincided with the start of these headaches, roughly?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It’s hard to say for sure, but… about the same time. I started not sleeping so good, and then… the headaches started. Maybe a week or so apart, I would guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the headaches and the sleep issues, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. No blurry vision, no dizziness. No… like a fever. Just the headache and being tired. Sometimes a little… forgetful, but I'm 90! I forget things all the time. But that’s not new.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you had any recent injuries to your head or neck, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I haven’t fallen, haven’t bumped my head. I’m careful, you know? I used to work around trains, always had to be careful. And I still am. No injuries, though. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'd like to perform a brief neurological exam, just to get a clearer picture. We'll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I don’t mind. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here on the examination table. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll move on to the neurological assessment. If you could just extend your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Is cold in here, isn't it?
DOCTOR: The room is regulated to ensure accurate readings. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. And the other side. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Do that a few times for me.
PATIENT: Like this? Is okay? My hands… not as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mr. Brum. A little uncoordinated, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Follow it with your gaze. Keep looking at my finger. Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? I used to be strong, working with the trains. But… time takes its toll, you know? Is good grip?
DOCTOR: Strength is adequate bilaterally. Finally, I'm going to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Little wobbly, maybe? My legs… they ain’t what they used to be. But I didn’t fall!
DOCTOR: Yes, a little unsteady. Based on this brief examination, the most likely explanation for your headaches is age-related changes and possibly some mild balance issues. However, given your age, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I recommend a CT scan of your head, just to be certain. Do you have any history of falls or a recent head injury that I should know about?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Is that… safe? I don’t like too much radiation. And… no, no falls, no injuries. I told you that, Doctor. But… if you think it’s best… what does it look for? And will it hurt? I don't do good with needles.
DOCTOR: A CT scan uses a very small amount of radiation – comparable to a few days of natural background exposure. It allows us to visualize the structures within your head, to rule out any underlying causes for your headaches, like a tumor or bleeding. It won’t involve any needles, Mr. Brum. You’ll simply lie on a table while a scanner rotates around you. It's completely painless. Given your age and the fact that these headaches are new, it is, in my professional opinion, the safest course of action. We need to be thorough. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any. But… a scan? Is expensive, isn’t it? I don't have much money. My wife… she passed away, and things are tight. I don’t have insurance, either. I just want the headache to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Brum. The cost of the scan is a valid point. Let me see what options are available. There are facilities that offer financial assistance programs, and we can explore those. In the meantime, I can prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. However, that is merely treating the symptom, not addressing the potential underlying cause. I still strongly recommend the scan for your peace of mind. We also should consider a referral to a neurologist, for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any family who could assist with arranging transportation and potential costs?
PATIENT: No family, Doctor. Just me. My wife… she did everything. I don’t… I don't bother anyone. I can manage. A mild pain reliever… that sounds good. Maybe that’s all I need. I just want to be able to sleep again. A neurologist… that sounds… complicated. And expensive. Is the pain reliever expensive?
DOCTOR: The pain reliever I’m going to prescribe is a common medication and relatively inexpensive. It’s called ibuprofen, 200 milligrams, take two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. I'll write you a prescription for a small quantity to start. However, I remain concerned about the cause of your headaches. Considering your lack of insurance and family support, I will personally contact a local organization that assists seniors with healthcare costs and referrals. They may be able to help with the scan and potentially connect you with a neurologist who offers a sliding scale fee. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be… very kind of you. Yes, please. I appreciate that. I just… don’t want to be a burden. And… thank you for listening to an old man complain about his head.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden, Mr. Brum. It’s my job to listen. Here is the prescription. I will also contact the organization and provide you with their contact information. If you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness, severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. And please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Just… old age. And a bad back, sometimes. But I manage that with heating pads. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your help. I feel a little better just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Brum. I'll have my nurse provide you with some information about the local organization and heating pad safety. Please follow up with my office in one week to let us know how you're doing. And again, don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
