DOCTOR: Hi Albino, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me. Lower back, mostly. Hurts to stand for long, and bendin’ down is… not easy anymore. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, but it feels worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain. And you said it’s been going on for a little while, but recently worsening?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Maybe… six months, I guess? Started kinda slow, just a little ache after gardenin’. But now… even gettin’ out of a chair is a problem sometimes. And I fall sometimes, too. Not often, but enough to worry me. It scares my daughter.
DOCTOR: Six months, starting with gardening… and now it’s impacting getting out of a chair, and you’ve had some falls. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about these falls?
PATIENT: Well, they haven’t been big falls. More like… stumble falls. I’ll be walkin’ and just… lose my balance. Once, I was reachin’ for somethin’ on a high shelf, and I just… went down. Didn’t break nothin’, thankfully. But it’s got me worried about… well, breakin’ somethin’ next time. And my bones… the doctor a long time ago said somethin’ about my bones bein’ weak. I forget the name of it. Something about bein’… porous?
DOCTOR: Porous… that sounds like osteoporosis. We’ll definitely need to look into that. So, these stumbles are happening while walking or reaching?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly when I’m reachin’ for somethin’ high, or sometimes just walkin’ around the house. It's hard to explain. Like my legs… they just give way a little. Not every time, but enough to make me nervous. I used to be so steady. It’s gettin’ to be a worry. And the back pain… it makes it harder to keep my balance, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain and these episodes of instability, especially when reaching or walking. And you suspect the back pain might be contributing to the balance issues. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingle. Just… weakness, sometimes. Especially when I try to stand up after sittin’ for a long time. It's a strange feelin’. Not like a sharp pain, more like… my legs just don't wanna work right for a minute. Then it gets better, usually. But it’s always there, that worry about fallin’. My daughter, she’s real worried, too. She keeps tellin’ me I need to be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness or tingling, just weakness, especially after sitting. That's good to know. And your daughter is understandably concerned. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Then we can talk about some possible causes and what we can do about it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel steady again. And not scare my daughter so much. Reflexes… I haven't thought about those in years! Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Just relax. I’m going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Let me know if that’s uncomfortable. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, but equal on both sides. Now, let's check your strength. Can you try to lift your right leg while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay, I can try. It might be a little hard, though. It’s not as easy as it used to be. Straight… like this? It's… not goin' up very high. My back is complainin' a little now.
DOCTOR: I see. That's good to know. It's alright, don't push yourself. Now let's try the left leg. Just do what you can. Alright. And now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand up slowly for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Okay, slowly… Whoa… that's… not easy. I feel a little dizzy. I’m holdin’ on pretty tight here. It feels… unsafe, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Don’t worry, we’ve got you. It sounds like your balance is definitely affected. And the diminished reflexes and weakness are concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. It could be related to your back pain, possibly with some nerve involvement. But given the history of falls and the weakness, we also need to rule out other things, like neuropathy or even a mild stroke. Do you follow me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. Nerve… like somethin’ pinched? And stroke… that sounds scary. I don’t feel like I’m havin’ a stroke, if that makes sense. But I understand you want to be sure. I just want to know what’s goin’ on and what we can do about it. My daughter is gonna be real worried about a stroke, too. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. A stroke can be serious, but we’re not jumping to any conclusions. It's just one possibility we need to rule out. We’ll start with some tests to get a clearer picture. I want to order some blood work to check for inflammation and vitamin deficiencies, which can affect nerves. And I also want to get an X-ray of your lower back to see what’s going on there. It sounds like nerve compression is a possibility. Depending on those results, we might need to consider an MRI or a CT scan, but let’s start with these first. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and an X-ray… okay. I can do that. What about the vitamin deficiencies? What kind of vitamins? I try to eat pretty well, but maybe I’m missin’ somethin’. And how long will it take to get the results? My daughter is drivin’ me home, and I don’t want her to worry all week.
DOCTOR: Good questions. We’ll be checking for Vitamin D, B12, and Folate, those are common ones that can affect nerve function. And yes, it’s great that you try to eat well, sometimes it’s hard to get enough from diet alone. As for the results, the blood work usually takes 2-3 business days to come back. The X-ray should be available a little sooner, maybe tomorrow. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I want you to be careful. Avoid any strenuous activity and use a cane or walker if you feel unsteady. And if you experience any new symptoms, like weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking, or severe headaches, go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Vitamin D, B12, Folate… I’ll try to remember those. Be careful, use a cane, and watch for new symptoms… okay. And you’ll call with the results in a few days. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better knowin’ what we’re lookin’ for. My daughter will be glad to hear all this, too.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this, and we'll come up with a plan to get you feeling steady again. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, be careful.
