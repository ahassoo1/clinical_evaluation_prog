DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what it is, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a whole feast. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a couple months. It’s a bit bothersome, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That certainly sounds unpleasant. A couple of months, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly. Time kinda…blurs these days, you know? But it’s definitely been long enough that it’s not just a one-time thing. It’s making it hard to enjoy my meals, and my wife worries ‘cause I’m not eating as much.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s good your wife is paying attention – that’s very helpful. And it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. It is important to figure out what’s going on, especially when it affects your appetite and well-being. Could you describe the feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not painful, not exactly. Just…stuffed. Like I ate way more than I did. And it happens fast. I could be having a nice bowl of soup, and after just a few spoonfuls, I feel like I couldn't take another bite. It's just…full. And not in a good way. Like something’s blocking it, almost. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. “Blocking” is a good way to describe it. And it’s not associated with any pain or discomfort, just this early fullness?
PATIENT: Right, no pain. Maybe a little…uncomfortable, sometimes, just from feeling so full when I haven’t eaten much. It’s not like heartburn or anything like that. Just…that stuffed feeling. And it's pretty consistent, doesn't seem to matter what I’m eating, like I said. Fish, chicken, soup, even just a piece of toast. It all feels the same after a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit tired lately, but I figured that’s just getting old, you know? And maybe a little bit of…well, my stomach's been a little bit upset sometimes, but nothing major. Mostly just a bit of gurgling and…feeling a little queasy sometimes after I eat, even though I haven't eaten much. It doesn’t last long, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some mild queasiness after eating. Anything else at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, I have been losing weight. Not a lot, but my wife keeps saying my pants are getting a bit loose. I hadn't really noticed it myself, to be honest. I figured I was just getting smaller overall, you know? Getting old and shrinking. But she's pretty sharp, my wife, always notices these things.
DOCTOR: Weight loss is significant, even if it's gradual. And it's good your wife is observant. Let's go through some more general questions, just to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes in…well, let's see. Not really. They're pretty regular, if you know what I mean. Nothing different there. Sometimes a little…soft, maybe, but nothing alarming. I haven't been having any trouble going, or anything like that. It's just...normal, pretty much. Not something I usually pay much attention to, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's alright, most people don't. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting at all. And no real nausea, not like being sick. Just that little bit of queasiness I mentioned, and that doesn’t happen every time I eat. It’s very mild, really. It's more like a…a discomfort than anything. It's hard to explain. It’s all just a bit…off, you know? Nothing major, but definitely not right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but they gave me some pills and it cleared up. Nothing major now, though. The doctor said I was good to go after that. Besides that…not much, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. Old age is the biggest problem now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for your heart or any other condition?
PATIENT: No, not anymore. They had me on some pills for a while after the heart trouble, but the doctor took me off them a few years ago. Said I didn't need them anymore. Just a little bit of aspirin every day, but that's it. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s acting up. But that's just over-the-counter stuff, you know, ibuprofen or something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with allergies, not to food or anything. I've been stung by a bee a few times, but that just hurt, didn't make me sick or anything. I've never had a bad reaction to any medication that I'm aware of. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my mother had diabetes. And my father had some trouble with his heart, like me. And my sister…she had cancer, a long time ago. But that’s about it, really. Nothing major on my wife's side, as far as I know. They weren’t big on talking about health stuff, to be honest. It was a different time back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm retired now, so I don’t do much work. I used to be a…well, I worked with the media, mostly communications. But now I mostly just take it easy. I live with my wife, we’ve been married a long time. We don't have any kids. I used to go fishing a lot, but I don’t get out as much these days. Mostly just sit around and watch TV, read the paper. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. And I don't get much exercise, to be honest. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, old age certainly changes things. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Obarr. That gives me a much better understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit faint. Your lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, your abdomen… It's soft, but I do feel some…fullness in the upper abdomen. Not painful to the touch, but definitely feels a bit distended. I don’t feel any masses or anything concerning. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age. Overall, the exam doesn't reveal anything immediately alarming, but the fullness in your abdomen is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay…fullness, you say? That’s what I’ve been feeling, I guess. Not painful, just…full. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re voicing your concerns, Mr. Obarr. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. The fullness in your abdomen, combined with the early satiety—that feeling of fullness after just a few bites—and the weight loss, could be due to a few different things. One possibility is gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining. Another is a potential issue with your gallbladder. Less common, but we need to rule it out, is a possible blockage or slow emptying of the stomach. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, kidney function, and to rule out any infection. I also think it would be helpful to get an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your gallbladder, liver, and stomach. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Alright, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgement. Blood tests and an ultrasound…sounds a bit scary, but I want to know what’s going on. When can I get these done? And…will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Obarr. It's definitely something we need to consider. I'll do my best to keep the costs as low as possible. I can order the blood tests for you here at the clinic. The ultrasound, we may need to send you to a facility in town. I'll get the costs for both before we proceed, and we can discuss them. The clinic does offer a small discount for patients without insurance, and I can also see if there are any local programs that might be able to help. As for when, we can do the blood tests today, if you're willing. And I can schedule the ultrasound for sometime next week. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Today would be good, if it’s not too much trouble. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. And thank you for looking into the costs and any possible help. That means a lot. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and making me feel…less scared, I guess. Let’s do the blood tests today, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. That’s what I’m here for. Alright, let’s get those blood tests done. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to take a sample. She’ll explain the procedure to you. It will just be a small prick of a needle, and it shouldn’t take long. After the tests are done, we’ll send them to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—like severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or fever—please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Would you like a written copy of these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written copy would be great. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Just in case I forget something. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing we’re doing something about it. Now, let's get those blood tests done. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Obarr. This summarizes everything we discussed today, and includes the contact information for the clinic. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be with you shortly. Just let her know if you're feeling anxious about the blood draw. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll see you soon.
