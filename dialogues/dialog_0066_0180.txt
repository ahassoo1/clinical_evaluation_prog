DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, good morning. I’m Dr. Condray. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do. It’s… this tiredness. It’s just bad. And I… well, I been eating dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. It just… tastes good sometimes. Don’t look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand you’re feeling very tired, and that’s been the main concern. And you mentioned… consuming dirt?
PATIENT: Yes! Dirt. Earth. Whatever. It started a few months ago, I think. Maybe longer? Time… it all blurs. It’s not like I’m shoveling it in, okay? Just… little bits. When I’m out in the garden. Or sometimes… I don’t even remember where I find it. It just… helps with the tiredness, a little bit. Not much, but… better than nothing. Honestly, it’s embarrassing even talking about it. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: No judgment at all, Hedy. It’s good you’re telling me everything. We just need to understand what’s going on. You said it started a few months ago, and it helps with the tiredness… how would you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's just… heavy. Like someone put weights on my eyelids. I can’t get going in the mornings. Even after a full night’s sleep. And it doesn’t go away. It’s always there, just… dragging me down. I used to be able to work all day, now I need naps. It’s awful. Really awful. And it’s getting worse. That's why I’m here, I guess. Before it gets completely out of hand. I got bills to pay!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a persistent, heavy fatigue that’s been getting worse. Besides the tiredness and… the dirt eating, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I dunno… I guess I’ve been a bit… cranky. My neighbor keeps complaining I’m not watering my flowers enough. It’s hot, okay? And I just… don't have the energy. And my stomach… it’s been a little off, sometimes. Not like throwing up or anything, just… bubbly. And I’ve been… forgetting things. Names mostly. Like, I knew my grandson’s name yesterday, and now… I can’t think of it! It’s embarrassing. Stop looking at me like I’m crazy.
DOCTOR: You’re not crazy at all, Hedy. These things happen. It's good you're telling me. Okay, let’s go through some things, just to be thorough. You mentioned stomach bubbling and forgetting names. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, appetite… not really. I eat when I remember to. And weight… I dunno. Clothes feel a little tighter, maybe? I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. Honestly, I don’t even want to know. It’s depressing. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I got things to do, you know. I didn’t spend all day preparing to come here to be quizzed like a child.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy, and I apologize if I’m making you feel rushed or quizzed. We are getting somewhere. I just need a little more information to understand what’s going on, and I promise to be as efficient as possible. Okay, how about this – any fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers? No. Chills… not really. It gets cold at night, but everyone gets cold at night! Night sweats… maybe? I do change my pajamas sometimes, but that's just because I get warm. Look, this is ridiculous. I'm a grown woman, I know when I'm sick and when I'm not. I just feel tired, and I eat a little dirt, okay? Is there a pill you can give me to fix it? Because if there is, let’s just get on with it!
DOCTOR: I understand you want a quick solution, Hedy, and we'll get there. But rushing into a pill without knowing why you’re tired and eating dirt could be harmful. Okay, let's talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have similar issues – fatigue, digestive problems, or… unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. My mother… she was always complaining. Everything hurt, always tired. But that was just old age, I think. My father… he was a strong man, worked hard his whole life. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. My sister… she lives in Oaxaca, haven't seen her in years. She always was… a bit strange. Always talking about spirits and things. Probably nothing relevant. Honestly, I don’t even remember much about their health. It was a long time ago. Can we please just get to the part where you give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about what you do day-to-day. Do you do any gardening?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally a sensible question! Yes, I garden. I told you I garden! It's my hobby. I used to do it professionally, landscape design. But now it's just… something I do. Keeps me busy. I grow roses mostly. And some vegetables. I like to eat fresh tomatoes. Why does that matter? Are you trying to figure out where I get the dirt from? Seriously. Just get to the point.
DOCTOR: It matters because gardening can be physically demanding, and you might be exposed to things in the soil. Have you always gardened in the same location, or have you moved around a lot?
PATIENT: Ugh, moving? No. I’ve lived in the same house for… oh, goodness, almost thirty years. Since my husband passed. This garden… it's always been here. It’s good soil, I think. My husband always took care of it. He knew everything about plants. Before him... well, I don’t remember much about the soil. He did all that. Stop looking at me like that! What’s so important about the soil?
DOCTOR: I'm asking about the soil because sometimes, certain minerals or toxins in the soil can cause unusual cravings, like eating dirt, and contribute to fatigue. It's called pica, and it can be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. We need to rule out any potential environmental causes. Do you use any pesticides or fertilizers in your garden?
PATIENT: Ugh, pesticides? No! Never. My husband always said they were bad for the environment. We used compost, mostly. And… some fish emulsion, I think? He used to order it online. I don’t really pay attention to all that stuff. He did everything. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like you’re blaming me for being sick! It's just tiredness and a little dirt, okay? I just want a pill! Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: You're not to blame for anything, Hedy. I'm not blaming you at all. I'm just trying to understand what's going on. Sometimes, tiredness and unusual cravings can be caused by simple things like vitamin deficiencies, and we can easily fix those with supplements. To be sure, I'd like to order some basic blood tests. Just a routine check to see if anything's out of balance. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Blood tests. Whatever. As long as it gets me closer to a pill. But don’t expect me to come back for a follow-up. I got things to do, you know. I’m a busy woman. Just tell me where to go to get it done. And make it quick!
DOCTOR: Okay. Here's a requisition for some basic blood work. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab]. They’re open until 5 pm today. Once the results are back – usually a few days – they will fax them to my office, and we can discuss them. If you do decide you'd like to discuss the results, please call to schedule an appointment. And Hedy… try not to eat any more dirt in the meantime, okay?
