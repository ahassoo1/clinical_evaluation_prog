DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s really quite annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Annoying is…putting it mildly, I imagine. Hiccups lasting over 48 hours can be a bit more concerning than the usual fleeting ones. Let’s get some details. Can you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they're just…regular hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jerk of the chest, the ‘hic’ sound. Not painful, just… surprising every time. They come and go, not on any pattern I can see. Sometimes a few minutes between them, sometimes just seconds. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that starts them, either. I've tried holding my breath, drinking water quickly, you know, all the usual things people suggest. Nothing’s worked.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no clear trigger, and the home remedies haven’t been effective. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no stomach pain really, though I did feel a bit bloated yesterday. Maybe a little heartburn, but I get that sometimes anyway. Not worse than usual. And no dizziness or anything like that. Oh! I did have a bit of trouble sleeping last night, kept waking myself up with them. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Slight sleep disturbance is…relevant. Bloating and occasional heartburn, noted. And you haven’t experienced any vomiting, diarrhea, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting or diarrhea. And my appetite is fine, actually. I ate a normal breakfast this morning. A bit of toast and some fruit. I just… wish they’d stop. It’s embarrassing, you know? Especially when I'm with people. I manage a small entertainment venue, so I have to talk to people all the time. It's hard to look professional when you're hiccuping.
DOCTOR: Professional appearances are…important, certainly. Alright, Ms. Redeye. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule things out. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. I hope you’re right about it not being serious. It’s just… unsettling, when your body does something it shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: Alright, does this cause any tenderness?
PATIENT: No, that’s not too bad. A little pressure, obviously, but no pain. It feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit gassy, but nothing unusual. I had a rather large lunch yesterday, so…
DOCTOR: Hm. Slightly firm to the touch, but no acute tenderness. Your vital signs are all within normal limits. Given the duration of the hiccups and the lack of any significant findings, it’s possible it's just a prolonged, albeit annoying, case of benign hiccups. However, given your age and the persistence, it’s prudent to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Rule out things? What sort of things? Should we be…worried? It’s just hiccups, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, while it’s unlikely to be anything serious, persistent hiccups can occasionally be a symptom of underlying conditions, such as esophageal issues, nerve irritation, or even, rarely, metabolic disturbances. We should perform a basic blood work panel to rule those out. And, just to be thorough, I'd like to order a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… and blood work? Oh dear. Is it really that serious then? I thought you said it was unlikely to be anything? What exactly are we looking for? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, it’s a precautionary measure, not an indication of imminent doom. The blood work will check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and basic metabolic panel. The chest X-ray will help rule out any pulmonary issues or abnormalities in the mediastinum. Neither procedure is painful. The blood draw will be a slight prick, and the X-ray is simply a brief exposure to radiation—a standard diagnostic tool. It's far better to be thorough, particularly with a persistent symptom. Do you consent to the blood work and X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Thorough. I suppose that makes sense. I really just want them to stop. Yes, alright. Yes, I consent. Blood work and the… the X-ray. Just… please tell me if there’s anything really wrong. I’m not very good with medical things. What do I need to do? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Good. A phlebotomist will draw your blood in the lab just down the hall. They'll give you instructions about fasting beforehand, if necessary. After that, the radiology department is two doors to the left. They'll explain the X-ray procedure. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue to try the usual remedies—holding your breath, drinking water—though I wouldn't expect miracles. If the hiccups become significantly worse, or if you experience any new symptoms—shortness of breath, chest pain, vomiting—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… how long does it usually take to get the results back? And… thank you, Doctor. For… being thorough. It’s just a bit worrying, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Generally, blood work results are available within 24 to 48 hours. The X-ray report usually takes a bit longer, perhaps three to five business days, as it requires interpretation by a radiologist. Our office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
