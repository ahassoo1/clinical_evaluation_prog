DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Stoffregen is right. My husband, he calls me Zoie, mostly. It's… hard to remember things these days, you know? What were we talking about again?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that is precisely why you are here, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The… going to the bathroom. It's been a bit tricky lately. Not painful, just… slow. Like a little stream, not a good rush. Does that make sense? I don't know what the word is… it just doesn't go like it used to.
DOCTOR: "A little stream," you say. And how long has this "trickiness," as you put it, been occurring, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s… a good question. A while now. Maybe… a couple of months? Or longer? It’s hard to say, honestly. Everything kind of blends together these days. My daughter, Leilani, she noticed it first, I think. She said I was taking longer in the bathroom. Does that help?
DOCTOR: A couple of months, fluctuating… yes. And are you experiencing any difficulty starting the stream, or is it simply reduced in force once you begin?
PATIENT: Oh… starting is… hmm. Sometimes it takes a minute. Like I have to… push a little? Not hard, but… you know. It's not a quick start, if that makes sense. Like waiting for the water to warm up in the shower. Does that sound right? I'm not good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: "Waiting for the water to warm up…" Yes, I understand the analogy, Ms. Stoffregen. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven't really… looked, to be honest. My husband usually… he helps with things like that. I don't pay much attention to those things, if you don’t mind me saying. Is something wrong? Should I be looking? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: It's simply part of a thorough assessment, Ms. Stoffregen. We need to rule out any infection. Now, do you experience any burning or discomfort while urinating?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not painful at all, just… slow and weak. Like a tired hose, that's what it feels like. And a little bit of pushing, sometimes. Is that… normal? I’ve had children, you know. Maybe it’s something from that, a long time ago?
DOCTOR: While previous pregnancies can contribute to pelvic floor weakness, it's important to determine the cause. Are you experiencing any difficulty emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Oh… emptying? Hmm. Sometimes I feel like… there’s still a little bit left? Like not completely empty. I have to go back a little while later sometimes, if that makes sense. It's not a lot, but… it happens. I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I'm just an old lady.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to perform a brief abdominal exam and then a quick pelvic exam. This will help me assess the situation. Please inform me if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh… a pelvic exam? Goodness. I haven't had one of those in… a long time. Okay. Just… let me know what you're doing, Doctor. And if it hurts, I will tell you. I’m a bit… sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm just gently pressing on your abdomen. I don't feel any masses. Bladder feels…full, even after you stated you recently voided. Now, I’m going to insert a speculum to visualize your vaginal canal. This may feel slightly cold and uncomfortable. Take a deep breath. Hmm. There is some mild prolapse of the anterior vaginal wall. And the urethral opening appears slightly… elongated. No signs of infection or inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh… “prolapse”? And “elongated”? Those sound… scary. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Is that why I can’t go to the bathroom properly? I just want to be able to go to the bathroom like a normal person again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, "prolapse" simply means the bladder has descended slightly. It’s common in women your age, especially after childbirth. The elongated urethral opening contributes to the difficulty with emptying. It means the muscle supporting the urethra has weakened. Now, it's not necessarily serious, but it is causing your symptoms. We need to consider a few options. I'm going to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate.
PATIENT: Oh… “weakened muscles.” That explains it, I guess. Everything is getting weak these days. That’s… alright. A test is good. Will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis is simple – just a urine sample. The post-void residual volume test is also painless, a quick scan after you urinate. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Now, depending on the results, we can discuss further options, such as pelvic floor exercises – Kegels – or, in some cases, a pessary. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll start with the tests. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Oh… Kegels? My daughter, Leilani, she told me about those. She said they are good for… everything. I don’t think I’m allergic to latex, no. My husband always uses the plain gloves when he helps me with my medicine. He’s very careful. So, tests first, then maybe these… Kegels?
DOCTOR: Yes, tests first. Then, we’ll assess the results and discuss a plan. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will explain the procedure. Now, I have other patients waiting, Ms. Stoffregen. If the results are abnormal, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Down the hall. And the nurse will help me. That’s good. No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything. I appreciate it. I hope the tests aren’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any sudden pain or fever. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
PATIENT: .
