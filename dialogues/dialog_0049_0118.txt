DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Hmm... yes. Well, it’s this certification, you see. Something about needing an exam… regularly. It’s all a bit… bureaucratic, isn’t it? Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. It’s for my profession, of course. A necessary evil, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A certification exam… right. And this requires a general physical, is that correct?
PATIENT: A… physical? I hadn't thought about a full physical. Is that required? I was under the impression it was simply a hearing and perhaps an eye check. I wouldn't have worn my best trousers if I'd known! It’s all rather inconvenient, frankly. Do explain.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Oriley, these certifications often have fairly broad requirements to ensure… a baseline of health. It’s difficult to say exactly what they need without seeing the paperwork, but a general physical is standard. It's quite thorough. We check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, examine your abdomen… routine things. It allows us to identify any potential issues that might affect your ability to perform your profession. It’s really quite sensible, if you think about it. Now, shall we proceed?
PATIENT: Sensible for whom, Doctor? I assure you, my profession does not require extraordinary athleticism. Though, I suppose one must be… reasonably functioning. Very well. If it must be done, let’s get it over with. Though I still maintain it’s a rather excessive precaution. Where do we begin? And will it be… uncomfortable? I have a low tolerance, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, the purpose isn't to assess your athleticism. It's about establishing a safe baseline. Discomfort is minimal – mostly just listening with the stethoscope and some basic palpation. We'll start with your vitals - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, we’ll move on to auscultation – listening to your heart and lungs. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. Not to anything… obvious. Dust, perhaps? A bit of hay fever in the spring. But truly debilitating allergies, no. And, Doctor, please don’t expect a lengthy and detailed recitation of my medical history. It’s… rather fragmented, you see. I trust you have my records somewhere? A gentleman shouldn't be put to such inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, we have some records. However, they’re… sparse. It’s always helpful to have a more complete history, but we can proceed with what we have. To clarify, by "sparse," I mean mostly just dates of previous visits. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… that’s a rather broad term, isn’t it? I had a rather nasty bout of the flu in… oh, goodness, decades ago. And I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A perfectly routine procedure, I assure you. Beyond that… nothing springs to mind. I lead a very… sedate life. Not much in the way of excitement, thankfully. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? A detailed accounting of my social activities?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Oriley, a recitation of your social activities is not required. Though, a history of any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease – would be pertinent. Have you been diagnosed with any such conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Heavens, no. I’m perfectly… robust for my age, thank you very much. A bit of stiffness in the knees, perhaps, but that’s merely the result of years of… well, standing. I maintain a reasonable diet. Mostly. And I certainly don’t feel chronically ill. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? It's all a bit… intrusive, wouldn’t you agree? I came for a simple hearing test, not a complete dismantling of my personal life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, the certification likely requires a baseline assessment to prevent potential issues. We are attempting to establish that baseline. Now, do you take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… I occasionally take an antacid, when I indulge in… richer foods. And a mild sleeping aid, from time to time. Insomnia, you understand. A common ailment amongst… discerning individuals. Beyond that, no. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible. A bit of good living and a comfortable bed are usually sufficient. Though, to be perfectly honest, I can’t recall the names of either. My housekeeper manages most of that, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam then. Please remove your shirt and shoes. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Do you have any pain currently, anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Goodness. Already? This is rather… swift, isn’t it? Very well. Though I must say, the room is rather chilly. Perhaps a blanket? And, to answer your question, a bit of… twinge in my lower back. Old age, you understand. Nothing debilitating. Though, I confess, lifting the groceries yesterday was… more strenuous than anticipated. It’s probably just a muscle strain. Now, where is the examining table? And is there anywhere to hang one's jacket? It's cashmere, you see. Wouldn't want it wrinkled.
DOCTOR: The examining table is right there, Mr. Oriley. A blanket is in the cupboard. Please lie down, and we will begin. We will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I will palpate your abdomen. Cashmere aside, I need you to be comfortable enough to tell me if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well, very well. All this undressing for a simple hearing test. It’s… undignified. Do be gentle, Doctor. And please, try not to linger too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. Important business, you understand. Now, proceed. Though I must warn you, my ribs are rather… prominent. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished in the lower lobes. Heart rate is regular at 72 beats per minute. I detect a faint murmur, grade I/VI. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No palpable masses. Now, can you tell me if you've experienced any recent weight loss or changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: A bit… sensitive there, Doctor. Perhaps a gentler touch? And weight loss? Heavens, no. I maintain a respectable… girth, thank you very much. And bowel habits? I prefer not to discuss such… personal matters with strangers. It’s simply uncouth. Though, I confess, digestion hasn't been quite as… regular lately. A touch of indigestion, perhaps. Blame the rich foods. Now, is that all? I’m feeling rather… exposed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to neurological exam. I need you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Can you tell me if your vision is clear in both eyes?
PATIENT: Clear? Well, reasonably so, I suppose. Though everything seems a bit… blurry these days. Age, you understand. One's eyesight isn't what it once was. Is this necessary, Doctor? All this staring and focusing… It’s rather tiring. And, frankly, my neck is becoming rather stiff. Are you quite finished with the… neurological examination? I have an important lunch reservation. One doesn't keep Lord Ashworth waiting, you know. Let's expedite this process, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? My grip isn’t what it used to be, I confess. All these years of… paperwork, you see. It’s rather detrimental to one's physical strength. Really, Doctor, must this take so long? I have an important appointment to discuss… investments. Lord Ashworth is a very busy man, and punctuality is of utmost importance. Now, can we please proceed to the hearing test? That's what I came for, after all. All this undressing and squeezing and staring… It’s simply preposterous.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. We’ll proceed with the hearing test. It appears your grip strength is diminished, and your reflexes are slightly reduced, but these findings could be attributed to age and inactivity. Before we proceed, I must ask about your family history. Are there any instances of hearing loss, dementia, or neurological disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Goodness, where does one begin? My mother had a touch of… forgetfulness in her later years. Though, to be fair, she wasn’t particularly attentive to begin with. My father was… rather deaf, I believe. Always shouting, you see. And there was a distant cousin, I think, who had some… ailment of the brain. But honestly, Doctor, it was decades ago, and I can’t recall the specifics. We weren’t particularly close. Really, is this truly necessary? All this delving into the past… I came for a simple hearing test, not a genealogical investigation. Now, can we please proceed? I’m feeling rather lightheaded. And I do believe my jacket is becoming wrinkled.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Oriley. Let's proceed with the audiometry. We’ll do this in the soundproof booth. It will involve wearing headphones and indicating when you hear a series of tones. It may take approximately 20-30 minutes. I'll leave you with the technician. She will explain the procedure in more detail. I'll review the results and discuss them with you afterwards. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must say, this has been… rather unpleasant. I do hope the technician is more… efficient than yourself. And please, tell her to be gentle with the headphones. And perhaps a cushion for the chair? One can never be too comfortable, you know. Now, let's get this over with. I have a very important appointment to keep. Lord Ashworth doesn't appreciate tardiness.
