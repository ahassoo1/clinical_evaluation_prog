DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, lately. My body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it’s good you brought it up. Changes like that can be a little concerning, so you’re doing the right thing by getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s hard to explain. It’s not bad, exactly. It’s just… different. Sweeter, maybe? And stronger, even when I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. I usually don't smell much at all, honestly. I work pretty hard all day, laying floors, and even then, I don't get overly… you know. But now, even after just sitting, I can smell it. It started maybe a month ago, I think? Around July.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around July, a change in your usual body odor – sweeter and stronger, even with minimal activity. And you generally don’t have a strong body odor even with physical work. That's helpful information. To get a better picture, can you tell me about any other changes you've noticed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no weight loss or gain. I've been sleeping okay, maybe a little restless sometimes, but nothing major. My appetite is normal. Oh! My periods have been… a little irregular. Not stopping, just… coming at different times than usual. I hadn’t really thought anything of it, honestly, I'm divorced and… well, things change, you know? But maybe that’s important.
DOCTOR: It is important. Irregular periods are definitely something we should consider. And thank you for sharing that. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I don’t really have much, thankfully. I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I had a gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but no other surgeries. No major illnesses, no allergies I know of, and I don’t take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers if my back is bothering me from work. I had the usual childhood vaccines, and I've had a flu shot every year for the last five years, I think. Oh, and my mom had diabetes, type 2. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Kerriann. Pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal ten years ago, no known allergies, occasional over-the-counter pain relief, childhood vaccinations, annual flu shots… and a family history of type 2 diabetes with your mother. Yes, that does matter. We’ll want to keep that in mind. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Didn’t really enjoy it enough to bother with it, honestly. And definitely no recreational drugs. I work too hard for that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, no smoking, no current alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Now, let’s talk about the smell a bit more specifically. Is it localized to one area of your body, or is it all over?
PATIENT: It seems to be… everywhere, I think. I can smell it on my clothes, even after I’ve washed them. And I can smell it on my skin, mostly when I’m warm, like after work. It’s not stronger in one specific spot, like my armpits or feet. It’s just… general. And it’s not a bad smell, like BO, it’s just… different. Sweeter, kind of musky, I guess? It’s hard to describe. It’s just not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, generalized odor, not localized, more noticeable with warmth, described as sweeter and musky, and different from your usual scent. That helps narrow things down. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and just take a general look at your skin. This will help us rule out some potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I’m comfortable with that. I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so that’s probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Again… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to palpate your thyroid. Just relax your neck. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules or tenderness. Now, let me take a look at your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes, lesions, or unusual discoloration. I don’t see anything immediately concerning. One last thing - let me check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and respiration is 16. Everything’s within normal limits. Given your symptoms and the normal physical exam, there are a few possibilities we should consider. One is bromhidrosis, which is a change in body odor due to sweat gland activity, but the generalized nature of the smell makes that less likely. Another possibility is a change in your metabolic processes. And, because of the irregular periods, we need to rule out hormonal imbalances.
PATIENT: Hormonal imbalances… that sounds scary. Is that serious? And what do we do about it? I mean, what kind of tests do we need to run? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to normal. I have a job to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Kerriann, and it’s good that you're asking questions. Hormonal imbalances can be a variety of things, and not all are serious. The irregular periods are the biggest clue right now, and we need to investigate. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your hormone levels - including estrogen, progesterone, follicle-stimulating hormone , and luteinizing hormone . We’ll also check your thyroid hormone levels again, just to be sure, and run a basic metabolic panel to get a general picture of your overall health. And, because of your family history, we’ll check your blood sugar levels to screen for diabetes. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable. And okay. I guess it’s good to check everything. So, just blood work? No… other tests? And how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back here again?
DOCTOR: Just blood work for now, Kerriann. That will give us the most information to start with. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Depending on the results, we may need to do further testing, but let’s focus on getting these initial results first, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. 3-5 days… I can wait. And you’ll call me? That’s good. I don't have to keep calling you. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? I mean, will changing my soap help, or is that pointless?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll definitely call you with the results. And you shouldn't have to keep calling me. As for what you can do in the meantime… there’s no need to drastically change anything right now. Changing your soap probably won’t hurt, but it likely won’t solve the problem either. Just continue with your usual hygiene routine. Try to reduce stress, as that can sometimes affect hormone levels, but don’t put too much pressure on yourself. I’m giving the lab a copy of the orders now. They’ll call you to schedule the blood draw. Is there anything else I can answer for you before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I hope we figure this out soon. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I understand, and we will do our best to figure it out. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s the paperwork with the lab information. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch. .
PATIENT: .
