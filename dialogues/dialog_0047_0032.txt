DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a rather delicate matter, you see. Not something one readily discusses. My wife insisted, naturally. She always insists. Something about… a bit of discharge. A most unpleasant surprise, I assure you. I haven't the faintest idea why it would be happening at my age.
DOCTOR: A bit of discharge, you say. Right. And where, specifically, are you experiencing this discharge from, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you be so… blunt? It’s… down there. Where else would it be? It’s… emanating from the… the anatomical region. My wife pointed it out, quite emphatically, I might add. I truly don't concern myself with such… details.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I apologize if my directness is unwelcome. It’s simply necessary to gather information for a proper assessment. “Down there,” as you put it, refers to the urethral opening, yes?
PATIENT: The… urethral opening? Is that what the young people are calling it these days? My wife simply said “from the front.” I suppose… yes, that's where it is. Though I must confess, I've never paid much attention to my… openings. Is this common, Doctor? At my age, I mean? It’s terribly embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: It can be common, Mr. Krok, although we do need to determine the cause. Discharge at any age warrants investigation. Now, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. It’s… wet. And… slightly discolored. Not a brilliant white, if that makes any sense. More… a sort of dull… off-white. It's not particularly… large in quantity, thankfully. Just… there. A nuisance, really. And it smells… faintly unpleasant. Though I’m not quite sure how one describes a smell. I haven’t the nose for such things anymore, I suppose. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Dull, off-white, and a faintly unpleasant odor. Has this been happening for long, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started… oh, perhaps a week ago? Maybe a little less. I hadn’t noticed it at first, naturally. I’m not constantly… inspecting myself, you understand. My wife brought it to my attention after I used the lavatory. She has a very keen sense of smell, my wife does. It’s been… consistent, I suppose. A little bit each time. Not getting worse, thankfully. Just… persistently present.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any pain, burning, or itching associated with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Good heavens, no. I’m 83 years old, Doctor, I’ve had plenty of pain in my life. A little bit of discharge isn’t going to cause me pain. No burning, either. Perhaps a slight… discomfort. But nothing I’d call pain. Itching? No, not particularly. Though my skin is rather dry these days, generally. Is that relevant, Doctor? I suspect my wife is simply exaggerating things. She always does.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Now, I’m going to need to ask you a few personal questions, and I understand they may be uncomfortable. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits? Doctor, really! What sort of questions are these? I go to the lavatory when I need to, as any civilized man does! No, there have been no… changes. I don’t go any more or less frequently than usual. And the stream is… adequate. Perfectly adequate! I assure you, my plumbing is still functioning, thank you very much. This is all rather undignified, you know. Are you quite sure all these questions are necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I apologize if I'm causing any embarrassment. These questions are necessary to rule out various possibilities. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Goodness no. I'm rarely ill. A little bit of a sniffle now and then, perhaps. But nothing serious. Body aches? Well, I'm 83 years old! My body aches all the time! That's just part of getting old, Doctor. Aches and pains are a given. I'm not about to start cataloging every little twinge. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I have a lunch date with my wife, you know. She makes a lovely lamb stew. I’d hate to be late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven't paid much attention to allergies, truthfully. I used to get a bit of a rash when I was a boy, from… something in the garden, I think. But I haven’t had a rash in decades. As for medications… I take a little something for my blood pressure, I believe. And my wife gives me something for my joints. A little white pill. I don't recall the names of them, I’m afraid. I leave all that to my wife. She handles all the details. I just take the pills when she tells me to. Is that helpful, Doctor? Or is this all terribly irrelevant?
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll try to get the names of those medications from your pharmacy. Now, do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Past medical conditions? Well, I had a bit of a cough once, a bad one. And my knees are rather troublesome, as I mentioned. My wife says I have arthritis, I think. As for diabetes or kidney problems… I haven't been officially told I have those. I’ve been to doctors before, of course. Many doctors over the years. They poke and prod and ask questions. But I rarely remember what they tell me. My wife usually handles the results and the explanations. She’s very good with those things. Is there a point to all this questioning, Doctor? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, your lack of specific medical information is making it difficult to determine the cause of your discharge. However, based on what you’ve told me, and given your age, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam, and I’d like to collect a urine sample. This will help us determine if there's an infection present. Are you willing to allow that?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Doctor, are you serious? I've told you, I'm 83 years old! I’ve been examined by doctors my entire life! And you want to examine me? What sort of examination are we talking about? And a urine sample? Must you be so… invasive? I feel utterly humiliated. I came here because my wife insisted, and now I’m being subjected to… this. I suppose… if you absolutely must. But I want it over quickly. And I expect complete discretion. This is a private matter, Doctor. A very private matter, indeed. But frankly, I doubt it will reveal anything useful. I maintain it’s just a minor irritation. A temporary inconvenience. But proceed if you must. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Please follow me to the restroom. I’ll provide instructions for collecting the sample. And yes, I assure you, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Afterwards, I'll need to perform a brief external examination. Please undress from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I’ll try to be as quick and discreet as possible. Here. Please change into this gown. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: Honestly… the indignity of it all… A gown, at my age… This is preposterous, utterly preposterous… I hope my wife appreciates this. She insisted, you know. She insisted… .
