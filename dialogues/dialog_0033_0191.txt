DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I asked to come in for an HIV test. It’s… something I wanted to get checked.
DOCTOR: Right. An HIV test. And what prompted you to want to be tested now?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. My husband and I, we haven’t been entirely faithful, if you understand. It’s been a… stressful time, and we both made mistakes. I just want to be sure, you know? For both our sakes. It’s been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Those things happen. When did this… situation occur?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It started… about six months ago, I’d say. It wasn’t a single incident, you understand. More… sporadic. And it finished about a month ago, when we both agreed to stop. We've been very careful since then, but… the worry lingers. Is six months long enough for something to show up in a test? I don’t really understand how these things work.
DOCTOR: Six months should be sufficient, generally. Though it depends on factors… risky behaviors, viral load… honestly, it’s a bit of a moving target. I suppose we can run the test, but don't expect definitive answers immediately. We’ll need to draw some blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve had injections before, and never had a problem. Though, to be honest, I haven't seen a doctor in… quite a long time. Is there anything else I should be telling you? I just want to make sure we do this right. And… is this test confidential? My husband doesn’t need to know I came here, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Of course it’s confidential. Patient privacy is… paramount. And no, there isn't much else you need to tell me at this stage. We’re simply going to perform the standard antibody test. It's a blood draw, as I mentioned. We’ll need to send it to the lab, and results typically take 3-5 business days. I’ll have the nurse draw the sample. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Three to five days… that feels like a long time. But I understand. As for my arm, left is usually better. I've had… some issues with my right arm in the past. Nothing serious, but it can be a bit sensitive. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I was quite anxious coming here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Nurse will be in shortly. While you're waiting, I'm going to quickly review your general medical history. You’ve listed very little here. Do you have any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s because… well, I haven’t really had any. I’ve been blessed with good health, mostly. A little arthritis in my knees, as one gets older, but nothing a bit of exercise and pain cream can’t handle. And… I used to have high blood pressure, many years ago, but that was when my mother was ill. It came down when I started taking better care of myself. I don’t take any medication for it now. Should I have brought a list? I feel quite foolish.
DOCTOR: No, it's not foolish. Though it would be helpful if patients were prepared. Alright, no current medications. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… oh, a fibroid removed, perhaps fifteen years ago? It was a fairly minor procedure, thankfully. Everything went smoothly, I believe. I don’t recall any complications. It was done at a hospital in Lagos, before I moved here. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Lagos… noted. And any family history of… significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult one. My mother… she had heart trouble, towards the end. And my father… he had diabetes. My older brother… he passed away a few years ago, from cancer, but I don't recall what kind. It was… a very sad time, and we didn't talk about it much afterwards. It was a long time ago, and I don’t have the details, I'm afraid. Does that help? I’m trying to remember everything, but it's been a long life, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… sufficient for now. The nurse should be here momentarily. We'll get this blood draw done, send it off to the lab, and you’ll receive the results within the timeframe I mentioned. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… I’m a bit nervous, that's all. But I'll try to remain calm. Thank you again for seeing me. And for being so… patient with my rambling. I just want to know, you know? That’s all. I want to know for sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll leave you to the nurse then. And please, try not to overthink things. It’s simply a routine test.
