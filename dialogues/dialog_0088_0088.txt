DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That can be quite disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. It’s… hard to explain. It's not a loud ring, exactly. More like a high-pitched whine, sometimes. Other times it’s just… a buzzing. It's always there, sort of, in the background. It’s worse at night, when it’s quiet. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, a high-pitched whine or buzzing, constant with worsening at night impacting sleep. Has this been happening continuously, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's been pretty continuous for… maybe the last month or so? Before that, it would come and go, like after a loud concert or something. But now it’s just… always there. Even when I’m trying to focus on something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started intermittently, triggered by loud noises, and has progressed to constant over the last month. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ringing – any dizziness, hearing loss, or pain in your ears?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. And no pain. My hearing feels okay, but… I don’t know. Maybe a little muffled sometimes? It’s hard to say for sure. I haven’t really noticed anything major, just the ringing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness or pain, possible slight muffling of hearing. And you said this started after loud noises?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. I went to a concert a couple months back, really enjoyed it, but my ears were ringing for a day or two afterwards. It went away, and I didn’t think much of it. Then it started coming back after other loud things, like the lawnmower, or even just being in a busy restaurant. And now… it just hasn’t stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of noise exposure preceding this. Let's go through some other things. Do you work in a noisy environment, or have any hobbies that involve loud sounds regularly?
PATIENT: I’m a waiter, so restaurants can get pretty loud, yeah. It’s not like I’m right next to the speakers, but… it’s busy. And I used to go to concerts a lot more than I do now, but yeah, that's about it for hobbies. Not really much time for hobbies these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, so ongoing noise exposure at work. Now, let's talk about your general health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I was a bit chunky a few years back, but I've lost weight. No high blood pressure, no diabetes. I got divorced last year, so that was stressful, but other than that, I'm pretty healthy. I have private insurance, so I try to go to the doctor when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, recent life stressor with divorce. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… trying to get through each day. No pills, no vitamins, nothing like that. I don't really like taking things if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your ears, and do a basic neurological exam to rule out anything more serious. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I got some shifts later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with your ears. Both ear canals appear clear. There’s no sign of infection or fluid buildup. The eardrums look normal, though a little dull. Reflexes are normal and balance seems stable. I'm going to do a quick tuning fork test to assess your hearing. The results are slightly diminished in both ears, but more pronounced on the right. It’s subtle, but it suggests some degree of hearing loss, especially higher frequencies.
PATIENT: Okay… diminished hearing, you say? Especially higher frequencies? Is that… bad? Is that why I'm hearing this ringing? I'm not sure what any of that means.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” but it does explain the ringing to some extent. The ringing, which we call tinnitus, is often associated with hearing loss, even mild hearing loss. The brain tries to compensate for the lost sounds, and that can manifest as ringing, buzzing, or other noises. Diminished higher frequency hearing is common with noise exposure. It's likely the noise exposure over time has caused some damage to the tiny hair cells in your inner ear, responsible for processing sound. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so the ringing is my brain trying to… fill in the gaps? Because my ears aren’t hearing everything they should be? That… actually makes a bit of sense, now that you say it. But what can I do about it? Will it go away? I really don't want to be stuck hearing this forever.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Unfortunately, in many cases, tinnitus doesn’t go away completely, but it can be managed. The goal is to reduce your exposure to further noise damage and help your brain adapt to the ringing. The first, and most important thing, is to protect your ears. Wear earplugs or earmuffs when you’re in loud environments – at work, concerts, even using lawnmowers. We can also explore some options for managing the tinnitus itself, such as tinnitus retraining therapy or sound masking devices. There are also apps that can help with this. I can give you some resources at the end of the visit. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, earplugs… definitely earplugs. I haven’t been wearing them at work, just… trying to avoid the really loud spots. Sound masking devices? What are those? And… is there anything I can take? Any pills or anything? I know you said no, but… is there anything at all?
DOCTOR: Good questions. Sound masking devices are essentially little machines or apps that play neutral sounds – white noise, nature sounds, even music – to help distract you from the ringing. They don't cure the tinnitus, but they can make it less noticeable. As for medication… there isn’t a specific pill to “cure” tinnitus. Some medications can temporarily alleviate symptoms like anxiety or sleep disturbances related to the tinnitus, but they don’t address the underlying cause. In some cases, certain medications can even worsen tinnitus, so we generally avoid them. I’m not going to prescribe anything at this time. Focusing on protecting your ears and exploring non-medication options is the best course of action. I think a good next step is a hearing test to get a more precise measurement of your hearing loss. That will help us understand the extent of the damage and develop a tailored management plan. I can refer you to an audiologist. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, a hearing test sounds good. Definitely refer me to an audiologist. And the earplugs… I'll get some earplugs. Honestly, I just want it to stop. It’s… really annoying. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It helps to know what's going on, at least.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand it's frustrating, and you’re taking the right steps to address it. Okay, I'm sending a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-rated audiologist in town. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m also printing out a resource sheet with information about tinnitus, ear protection, and some helpful apps. For now, focus on protecting your ears, getting enough sleep, and managing your stress. If the ringing gets significantly worse, or you experience any other symptoms like dizziness, hearing loss, or pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thanks again, Doctor. Really. I’ll get those earplugs and schedule an appointment with the audiologist. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day. .
