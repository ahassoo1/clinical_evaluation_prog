DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… well, I keep getting very red in the face. Like a… a flush, you know? It happens sometimes, not always. It’s a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing sensation… I understand. And you said it doesn't happen every time?
PATIENT: No, no. Not every time. Maybe… two, three times a week? Sometimes more if I… if I eat something spicy. But even when I don’t eat spice, it happens. It's just… sudden. Warm feeling, then red face. It goes away after a little while.
DOCTOR: Alright. Two or three times a week, sometimes more with spicy food, but it can happen even without it. And it resolves on its own after a bit. Do you notice anything else happening when this flush occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels a little fast. Not… not racing, just… quicker than normal. And I get a little… sweaty. Mostly my face, but sometimes my hands too. It doesn’t last long though. Just with the red face and the warm feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a quicker heartbeat and some sweating along with the flushing. Have you noticed if anything specific seems to trigger it, aside from spicy food?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not really… I mean, I’ve been trying to think about it. I don’t think so. Sometimes it happens when I’m talking to people… but mostly new people. Not my friends, you know? Just… when I meet someone new. It's silly, I think.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Enrique. That's helpful information. It sounds like it might be related to situations that cause you some anxiety or stress. Let's talk a little more about your medical history, just to get a better picture. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no conditions. Doctor said I was healthy, last time I saw someone. That was… oh, maybe five years ago? Just a check-up. Nothing wrong. And I don’t take any medicine, not regularly. Just sometimes… for a headache. Over-the-counter.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, last check-up five years ago, and over-the-counter headache medication as needed. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. Just… a little cut when I was a boy, but my mother fixed it. Nothing serious. Nothing a doctor needed to look at.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family… has anyone else in your family experienced something similar to what you're describing – frequent flushing, or maybe anxiety or rapid heartbeat?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father, he used to get very red in the face when he was angry. But it was different, you know? It was always when he was upset. Mine isn’t always anger. My mother… she worried a lot. She got headaches. But I don’t think she flushed. I don’t remember. It was a long time ago. And I have no brothers or sisters. Just me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had flushing related to anger, and your mother experienced headaches and anxiety. That’s helpful. Now, a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no. I don't drink. Never liked it. And I don't smoke. My wife… she used to, but she stopped many years ago. And I don't… I don't use any of those other things. Just a normal life, you know? After my wife… it’s just a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Just to finish up the history part, are you allergic to anything – medications, foods, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Doctor asked me that last time, five years ago, and I said no then too. I eat everything. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy when the flowers bloom, but I don’t take anything for it. It goes away. Just a little itchy. Not a big problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known allergies. Okay, Enrique, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing it. I'm a little worried, to be honest. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll figure this out. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. Then we can discuss what might be going on. Okay, your heart rate is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Blood pressure is slightly high, but again, not dramatically so. I don't see any obvious rashes or skin changes. Your face does appear a little flushed right now. I'm going to document that. “Patient reports intermittent flushing episodes, accompanied by tachycardia and mild diaphoresis. Current exam reveals mild facial erythema and slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure.” Now, Enrique, based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called rosacea, possibly with elements of anxiety-related flushing. However, to be sure, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, rule out any underlying infection, and get a baseline CBC. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Rosacea? I don’t know what that is. And tests? Okay, if you think it’s important. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… will the tests be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s… a little difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Enrique. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pimple-like bumps on the face. It’s usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. As for the tests, I understand your worry about cost. I’ll try to order only the most essential ones, and I can see if the lab has a financial assistance program or a discounted rate for uninsured patients. We can also discuss the results together and prioritize treatment options that are affordable. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, though, just to be safe. The tests I’m thinking of are a complete blood count , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a basic metabolic panel. These will give us a good starting point. Do you agree to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, if you think so. CBC, TSH, and… the other one. Yes. Just… tell me how much it will cost before you order them, okay? I need to know if I can afford it. And please… don't worry if it takes a little while. I have savings, but… it’s not unlimited. My wife… she left me some, but… it’s going down.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Enrique. I completely understand. I'm looking at the lab's website now. For those three tests – CBC, TSH, and basic metabolic panel – the self-pay price is approximately $150 total. I'll also call the lab directly to see if they can offer any discounts for uninsured patients. I'll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab at your convenience. They'll let you know the exact cost before they draw the blood. While we wait for the test results, we can discuss some simple things you can do to manage the flushing, like avoiding triggers like spicy foods and stressful situations. We can also talk about over-the-counter skincare products that might help soothe your skin. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be very helpful. Avoiding spice… I can do that. Stressful situations… that's harder. But I'll try. And skincare… yes, please. Tell me about the skincare. What should I look for? Something not too expensive, please. My wife… she always bought very fancy things, but I don’t need fancy. Just… something to help.
DOCTOR: Of course. Fancy isn’t necessary at all. For skincare, you want to look for products that are gentle and hydrating. Avoid anything with harsh chemicals, alcohol, or fragrances, as these can irritate your skin and worsen the flushing. Look for a moisturizer with ceramides or hyaluronic acid, as these help to restore the skin’s natural barrier. A gentle cleanser is also important. Cetaphil or CeraVe are good, affordable brands that are widely available. You can also consider a mineral sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, to protect your skin from sun damage. Avoid scrubbing your face or using hot water, as this can also irritate your skin. Pat your skin dry with a soft towel, rather than rubbing it. And remember, consistency is key. Use these products twice a day, even when your skin isn’t flushed. I can write down these recommendations for you, if you’d like. We can also talk about some lifestyle changes that might help reduce your stress levels, like exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please write them down. Cetaphil and CeraVe… I’ll remember that. Exercise… I used to walk a lot with my wife. Maybe I should start again. Meditation… I don’t know about meditation. Sounds complicated. But walking… yes. And thank you. You’re very kind, Doctor. I was very worried, but I feel a little better now. Just… getting the tests done and knowing what to look for. That’s a big help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Enrique. I'm glad I could help ease your worries. Taking small steps, like starting to walk again and being mindful of your skincare, can make a big difference. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here's the requisition form for the blood tests, and the skincare recommendations. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now, once the results are back, so we can discuss them together. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, a week from now is good. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been very patient. I appreciate your help. I think… I think that's all for today. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
