DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit of a strange one, really. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it before they’ll approve my trip. It’s for a trip I’m planning… soon.
DOCTOR: A letter for… fitness to fly?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It's… after losing my husband, I want to go visit family overseas. It's been a long time coming, and the insurance company is being very strict. They said something about needing confirmation from a doctor, just to be safe. I don’t have any… conditions, not that I know of, that would stop me from flying. It just feels like a lot of paperwork for a simple visit.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we want to ensure your safety, of course. It’s standard procedure, really. Just to be thorough. I'm... vaguely recalling some guidelines about this. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I haven’t really needed to. Just my regular check-ups, you know? And… after my husband passed, I did see a grief counselor for a while, but that was mostly talking, not… medical. I have Medicare, so I go when they tell me to for those standard things. Does that make sense? I don’t usually… go to doctors unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Medicare… yes, I see some records here for routine screenings. Good. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I'm aware of, anyway. I can eat anything, take any medication… nothing bothers me. Honestly, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to stay active, eat well… you know, the usual. It’s just… this letter is stressing me out more than anything! I just want to go see my family. Is there a form I need to fill out or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, a form would be… helpful. But first, let’s just do a very quick physical exam, just to be on the safe side. Blood pressure, pulse… listen to your heart and lungs. Routine things. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. The quicker we can get this done, the better. I have a flight to book, and the prices are changing every day! I just… I really appreciate you squeezing me in. It's been a bit of a whirlwind trying to get everything organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… easy for you to say! It's just the thought of the hassle if there's a problem with the letter… it's a bit much. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 122 over 78. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Never have. I walk up and down hills all the time – it’s nothing for me. Maybe a little winded after a really steep climb, but that’s just normal, right? I used to hike a lot with my husband, before… well. But no, no shortness of breath. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any… chest pain?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Not even during exercise. I feel… strong, actually. Stronger than I expected, given everything. It’s just… the thought of flying always makes me a little anxious, if that counts. But not chest pain, no. It's more like… butterflies, I suppose. A nervous feeling. I haven’t flown since… since it happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about flying, especially given your circumstances. No chest pain, good. Just to be thorough, let's check your oxygen saturation. It’s a quick, non-invasive test.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds fine. Just… hurry it up, please? I'm starting to feel a bit silly, being poked and prodded for a simple visit to see family. I just want to get this letter and be done with it. What number are you looking for?
DOCTOR: 98%. Excellent. That’s a very healthy reading. Given your medical history, your physical exam, and the current readings, I don’t see any contraindications to flying. I can certainly write a letter stating you are fit to travel.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Really? That's… that's such a weight off my shoulders. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. Can I… can I get a copy of that letter today? And is there a fee for this? I wouldn’t want to surprise my husband’s mother when I get back.
DOCTOR: Here you are. It states you are medically cleared for air travel. As for the fee… It will be $35. Standard consultation fee for a fit-to-fly letter. I will have the receptionist process that for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: Perfect. Yes, this is exactly what I needed! Thirty-five dollars is fine, no problem at all. No, I think that's everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Sham. You’ve been very kind, and I really appreciate you squeezing me in. I can finally book that flight! Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. Have a safe trip.
