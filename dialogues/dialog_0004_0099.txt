DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received a letter from the clinic regarding some test results… an endoscopy, I believe it was called? And it seems something wasn’t quite right, according to the paper. I must confess, I don’t entirely understand all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here your endoscopy from July 15th. It did show some irregularities. Now, before we get into the specifics of those results, let’s just go over a little bit about why you had the endoscopy in the first place. Were you experiencing any symptoms that prompted the test?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. Well, for several months now, I’ve had… discomfort. A sort of burning feeling in my stomach, mostly. And some bloating. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough to be worrisome. And then, occasionally, a bit of nausea. It wasn't severe, thankfully, but enough to disrupt my routine. I thought perhaps it was just something I ate, but it persisted. That’s why my family doctor suggested the endoscopy.
DOCTOR: Burning sensation, bloating, and intermittent nausea… and how long ago did these symptoms begin, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began sometime in late February, I believe. Around the time of the yearly festival, actually. It started very subtly, just a little indigestion after meals. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. It gradually worsened over the following months, though. Not dramatically, but noticeably. Enough to… well, to warrant a visit to Doctor Ramirez, and then ultimately, the endoscopy.
DOCTOR: And has anything – any particular food, activity, or medication – seemed to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I’ve tried to pay attention to that. Spicy foods definitely aggravate it. Anything with chili peppers, for example. And rich, fatty meals don’t sit well either. Coffee, too, I’ve noticed. It seems to worsen the burning sensation. As for things that help… well, nothing truly alleviates it completely. Sometimes, a simple cup of chamomile tea offers a little bit of relief, but it’s temporary. And I haven’t started taking any medications for it, aside from the occasional antacid, which doesn’t do much.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, burning sensation aggravated by spicy foods, fatty meals, and coffee, with minimal relief from chamomile tea and antacids offer little improvement. Have you experienced any vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No vomiting at all. Just the nausea, as I mentioned, and occasionally a feeling of fullness very quickly when I eat. It’s not a pleasant sensation, but it’s not… violent, if that makes sense. And no blood in my stool, either, if you were wondering. I do try to be observant of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, the endoscopy report indicates some inflammation in your esophagus and stomach, and they did find a small ulcer in the antrum of the stomach. It's not large, but it’s present. It's also noted that there was some evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection. Are you familiar with that?
PATIENT: Helicobacter… pylori? The name sounds vaguely familiar, perhaps I read something about it once… but I can't quite place it. No, Doctor, I don't believe I am familiar with it. Is it… serious? Is that what’s causing all of this discomfort? And an ulcer… that doesn’t sound good at all. I'm a bit worried now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. H. pylori is a bacteria that infects the stomach lining and can cause inflammation, ulcers, and, if left untreated, even stomach cancer. It’s quite common, actually, and usually treatable with antibiotics. The ulcer itself is what’s causing your discomfort - the burning sensation, bloating, and nausea. We’ll need to confirm the infection with a stool test, but based on the endoscopy, it’s highly likely. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I haven’t been taking anything regularly. Just the occasional antacid when the burning gets particularly bad, as I mentioned before. Otherwise, I'm quite healthy, all things considered. I eat a reasonably balanced diet, I try to get enough rest… I suppose age is catching up with me, though. But no regular medication, no. And a stool test... that sounds straightforward enough. I'm happy to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll order a stool test to confirm the H. pylori infection. I also want to order a complete blood count to check for anemia, which can sometimes occur with ulcers. And, while the endoscopy ruled out anything immediately concerning, I'd like to do a follow-up endoscopy in three months to monitor the healing process. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. A complete blood count, a follow-up endoscopy… I trust your judgement entirely. Three months seems reasonable. I’m grateful you’re taking this seriously and investigating thoroughly. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Any specific dietary restrictions or things I should avoid?
DOCTOR: For the stool test, you'll receive instructions with the collection kit. It requires a small sample, and there are specific guidelines to follow for accurate results. As for dietary restrictions, I recommend avoiding spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine, and alcohol for the next few weeks, as these can irritate the stomach lining and hinder healing. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals rather than large ones. We will discuss antibiotic options if the stool test confirms the H. pylori infection. It’s a fairly straightforward treatment, but it’s important to complete the full course. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That's very helpful, thank you. No spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol… smaller meals… I can manage that. I believe I can. And you mentioned antibiotics… are there any potential side effects I should be aware of? I've heard stories, you know. I'd like to be prepared. And… what about my family? Should they be tested as well, considering H. pylori is an infection?
DOCTOR: That's a valid question regarding your family. H. pylori can be spread through close contact, so testing family members is reasonable, especially if they exhibit similar symptoms. However, asymptomatic carriers may not require treatment unless they have a history of ulcers or stomach cancer in the family. We can discuss testing options for them if you wish. As for the antibiotics, common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. Some people experience a metallic taste in their mouth. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, like allergic reactions. We will monitor you closely during the treatment and adjust the medication if necessary. Now, I will order the stool test and the complete blood count. The lab results should be available in about a week. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan, if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfect. A week for the results… and a follow-up appointment to discuss everything… I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. And the information about my family is very helpful. I’ll speak with them about getting tested. I believe that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any questions before then. And please, avoid those spicy foods! Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I certainly will. And I will be sure to call if anything changes. You have a good day as well.
