DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been having a… a feeling of pressure in my bladder, pretty consistently. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and a little worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. A consistent feeling of pressure in the bladder – that’s certainly something we should investigate. Could you describe the sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… full, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. Like there’s still some left, you know? And it’s not a sharp pain, more of a heaviness, low in my abdomen. It doesn't hurt to go, thankfully, but the feeling lingers afterward, and sometimes I feel like I have to go even when I don’t really need to. It’s been happening several times a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a persistent feeling of fullness even after voiding, a heaviness low in the abdomen, and a sense of urgency even when you don't feel a strong need to go… that gives us a good starting point. How long ago did these symptoms begin, and have they been gradually worsening, or did they start suddenly?
PATIENT: It began… let me think. Around the first week of July, I believe. So, almost a month now. It started gradually, a little annoyance here and there. But over the past week or so, it’s definitely become more consistent and noticeable. Not suddenly worse, but… steadily increasing in how often I’m aware of it. I don't think it's a drastic change, but it's enough to concern me.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you noticed any other changes accompanying this sensation?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I've been drinking about the same amount of water as usual. No changes there. I haven’t noticed any fever, or pain in my back, or any blood in my urine. My bathroom habits are… regular, in terms of frequency, it’s just after I go, that feeling remains. I haven't had any changes in my diet, either. Hmm… I suppose that’s all. I haven't noticed anything else out of the ordinary, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No fever, back pain, hematuria, or changes in diet or fluid intake… that narrows things down a bit. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. I have mild asthma, but it’s well-controlled with an inhaler, and I haven’t needed it very often lately. No surgeries, no chronic conditions beyond the asthma, and I’m currently on no medications besides that inhaler when needed. I have Medicare, as I mentioned, and I usually see Dr. Ramirez for my annual check-ups. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: That's excellent information, thank you. And has anyone in your family had any history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or similar issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had some urinary tract infections when she was older, but nothing serious. She didn’t have any long-term problems because of them. My grandmother, on my father’s side, had diabetes, but I don’t believe she had any issues specifically with her bladder or kidneys. No one else that I can recall had anything significant. I am married, by the way, if that’s relevant. My husband is very healthy.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Social history is relevant. And regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, mostly. I do a bit of walking when I can, and I enjoy cooking. I don't have a particularly stressful job, thankfully – I'm a graphic designer.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Ms. Creagh. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your abdomen, and perform a gentle palpation to check for any tenderness, and a neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'd like to get to the bottom of this, so whatever you need to do, I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Take some deep breaths for me, if you could. And now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. No acute tenderness noted on palpation. I don't feel any masses. Now, I’m going to perform a quick neurological exam, just to assess the reflexes in your lower extremities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. No pain at all so far. Just the normal pressure I’ve been feeling. You’re very thorough, which I appreciate. Yes, go ahead with the neurological exam. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Good. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. I'm also going to do a quick assessment of your lower back, just to rule out any referred pain. No tenderness in the lumbar spine noted. Everything feels normal so far. Given your symptoms and the results of the physical exam, I suspect this could be a few things. It could be an overactive bladder, a mild urinary tract infection that hasn't fully developed, or even some pelvic floor dysfunction. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urinalysis, and a urine culture, just to rule out any infection. And I would also like to schedule you for a post-void residual volume test, to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Absolutely, I'm happy to have those tests done. A urinalysis, a urine culture, and a post-void residual volume test… that all makes perfect sense. I want to be sure we rule everything out and figure out what's going on. When can we schedule those? And is there anything I should do to prepare for them?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse draw a urine sample right after this consultation. For the post-void residual volume test, you'll simply need to urinate normally, and then the nurse will use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s a quick and painless procedure. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. While we wait for the results, I recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly, but avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Also, try to avoid bladder irritants, like citrus fruits and spicy foods. Are you currently experiencing any constipation?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning works perfectly, Doctor. Thank you for arranging that so quickly. And yes, I’ve been drinking plenty of water, as always. The fluid intake, avoiding caffeine and spicy foods… I can definitely do that. I'll make a note to cut out the citrus as well. Constipation? No, thankfully, I haven’t been experiencing any constipation. My diet is fairly regular in that regard, and I try to eat a good amount of fiber. So, no issues there. I'm grateful for all your attention to detail, Doctor. It makes me feel much better knowing we’re covering all the bases.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Ms. Creagh, we’ll get these tests done tomorrow, and I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them, and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, flank pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I truly appreciate your time and attention. Knowing what steps we're taking, and having a follow-up appointment scheduled, puts my mind at ease. Thank you again for your kindness and professionalism. I will contact the office immediately if any of those symptoms arise.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the urine sample. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and we’ll see you next week.
