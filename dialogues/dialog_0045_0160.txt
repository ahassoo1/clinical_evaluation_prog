DOCTOR: Alright, Candis, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. Just… dragging all the time. And it's not like I've been doing anything. Mostly just puttering around the house. And… well, it’s embarrassing to admit, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to worry me, I guess. Don't look at me like that, young man. It tastes good, alright? What's it to ya?
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, mostly. Red clay from the flower pots, actually. Don’t make a face! It's… soothing. And I crave it. I don’t want to be eating dirt, but if I don’t, I feel… jittery. Like I need something. It's ridiculous, I know. But that’s why I’m here, isn't it? To figure out why an old woman is munching on potting soil.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. That’s… unusual, certainly. We need to explore this a bit. First, let's talk about the tiredness. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started… probably around spring? Maybe March? It’s hard to say exactly, it just sort of crept up on me. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it's gotten worse. I used to be able to get through the whole day, gardening, cleaning… now I’m napping by two o’clock. And I still feel tired. It's exhausting being exhausted, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue onset around March, gradually worsening. And this tiredness isn’t relieved by rest. Any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, my stomach hasn’t been right. Sort of… upset. Not sick, exactly. Just… queasy a lot. And I’ve been more irritable than usual. Snapping at the grocery store clerk, things like that. Which isn’t very nice, I know. But honestly, I’m just… worn out. And, of course, the dirt eating. Does that count? Because it’s a symptom of something, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so queasiness, irritability, and… a craving for clay. Let's talk about this clay craving a bit more specifically. Is it a constant urge, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It’s not like I wake up demanding dirt. But certain smells… like after it rains, or even just being in the garden… it triggers it. Then I can’t think about anything but it. And it’s not like I eat a whole pot full, mind you. Just a little bit. A spoonful or two. Enough to… satisfy the urge. It's hard to explain. It’s a comfort, I guess. A silly comfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it started around spring... have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? Hmm. Not really. I still eat. Not as much as I used to, maybe. But that could just be from being tired all the time, honestly. I don’t feel like cooking, and when I don’t feel like cooking, I just have a sandwich or something. Nothing fancy. I’ve always been a simple eater. Though… now that you mention it… meat doesn’t appeal to me much anymore. I used to love a good steak, but the thought of it just… doesn't sound good.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, specifically a lessened desire for meat. Now, have you noticed any unusual cravings besides the clay?
PATIENT: Unusual cravings… besides the dirt? Let me think. No, not really. I always liked sweets, a little piece of chocolate after dinner, but that’s nothing new. Oh! Wait… sometimes I get a strange taste in my mouth. Sort of metallic. Like… pennies. But it doesn’t happen often. And it goes away quickly. It's probably nothing. Just an old woman's funny quirks, I expect.
DOCTOR: Metallic taste… okay. We're building a picture here. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can I listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. I suppose so. Just don’t poke too hard. I’m a delicate flower, you know. And be quick about it, if you wouldn't mind. I’ve got things to do, even if I am too tired to remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Deep breath in… and out. Sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your abdomen. This might be a little uncomfortable. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, there. That’s a bit tender. Right… about there. Not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. It's been like that for a while, I think. I just figured it was my age. Everything aches when you get to be my vintage, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I feel a slight tenderness there as well. Now, a few more quick questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… slower, I suppose. Not regular like it used to be. And… …darker. Not black, exactly. Just… not the usual color. I don't like talking about this. It’s… unladylike.
DOCTOR: Darker stools, along with fatigue, irritability, clay craving, metallic taste, abdominal tenderness… and decreased appetite with a lessened desire for meat… Alright Candis, I need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, iron studies, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We're also going to do a stool sample to check for any internal bleeding. It’s important we rule out some things.
PATIENT: Blood work? A stool sample? Honestly. It’s like you're trying to take me apart piece by piece. All this for a bit of tiredness and a silly craving. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try not to poke too much. And tell me when I can go home. I’m starting to feel faint just thinking about all of this.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not pleasant, Candis, but it's better to be thorough. It will help us figure out what's going on. We need to rule out iron deficiency anemia, which can cause many of these symptoms, including the clay craving, known as pica. It's also important to rule out any internal bleeding. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now. And the stool sample instructions are simple. I'll give you a collection kit and instructions to take home. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids.
PATIENT: Pica… that’s what you call it? Eating dirt. Fancy words for a foolish habit. Fine. I'll do your tests. Get it over with. Just please, hurry. And don’t expect me to be grateful. It’s not like I enjoy being poked and prodded.
