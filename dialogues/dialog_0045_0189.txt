DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… well, my business. Been seeing a bit of red when I go to the bathroom. Not a good sign, is it? I used to be able to tell what was what, you know, being a pilot and all, but these old eyes…and frankly, doctors these days. Not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Red in the bathroom, alright. We’ll figure it out. And I assure you, sir, I went to a perfectly good medical school. Now, when you say "red," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean specific? It’s red. Like blood, naturally. Not pink. Not brown. Red. Though sometimes it’s… mixed in. It's not like I carry a colour chart in there with me, you know. Honestly, young man, sometimes I wonder if they even teach you to listen anymore. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. No, it won't take all day. Just trying to get a clear picture. "Mixed in" with what, exactly?
PATIENT: Well, with… everything else, naturally. You know. What comes out. It’s not a pleasant topic for conversation, is it? I've always been a regular fella, if you catch my drift. But this…this is different. It’s just unsettling. And frankly, I haven't been sleeping well since I noticed it. Thinking the worst, naturally. A man my age...you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, blood mixed in with stool. And you've noticed this recently, and it's disrupting your sleep. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, let me think... everything feels a bit… looser, I suppose. Not like water, mind you, but not… firm, either. Like a poorly made pudding. And I’ve been going more often, if you must know. A nuisance, really. Used to be able to schedule things, you know? A pilot's life. Timing is everything. Now… it’s just unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools, more frequent bowel movements, and the blood. Have you noticed any pain or cramping with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain, no. More of a… discomfort. A dull ache, sometimes. Mostly after, if I’m being honest. Like I’ve… strained myself a bit. And a bit of bloating, now that I think about it. Like I’ve swallowed a whole goose. It’s all very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. And you said you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: About a week, maybe a bit longer. Hard to say exactly. Time doesn't mean much anymore, does it? Everything blurs together. It started gradually, just a little bit of red, and then it got… more noticeable. Enough to worry a man, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mr. Rowbottom, I’m going to need to do a quick exam. Just feeling your abdomen, listening to your bowels. It won’t be comfortable, but it’ll help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Exam, is it? Fine. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I haven't got all day, and I’m a sensitive man. Besides, you’ll probably just tell me it’s stress. That's what they always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Just going to listen and feel. I'll be gentle. Now, can you tell me if you feel any tenderness or pain here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes, actually. Right… there. A bit tender, yes. Not sharp, like a knife, but…uncomfortable. Like someone’s pressing on a bruise. A bit lower down, on the right side.
DOCTOR: Okay, and what about here?
PATIENT: Here? A little bit, yes. All over, really. Not terrible, but...definitely not comfortable. This is a bit undignified, you know. A man my age…having his stomach poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly hyperactive. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a few things. It's possible this is something relatively minor like a bit of diverticulitis, but given your age and the presence of blood, we need to rule out something more serious. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for infection and blood. We'll also need to consider a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy?! Now hold on a minute! A colonoscopy? That sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. Are you sure that’s necessary? I mean, couldn’t we try…something else? A pill, perhaps? I don't like the sound of that at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns. A colonoscopy is a bit involved, but it’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of the bleeding and rule out anything serious, like polyps or cancer. A pill won't give us that level of detail. However, we can start with the blood work and stool test. If those results are concerning, or if your symptoms worsen, then a colonoscopy will be strongly recommended. We can discuss the preparation process in detail if it comes to that, and I assure you, we’ll make it as comfortable as possible. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm…let me think. Not that I know of, no. Though I had a bit of a reaction to some cream once, years ago. Made my skin all itchy. But nothing serious. And I don’t take any pills regularly, if that makes a difference. I prefer to keep things natural, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, no regular medications. Okay. I'm going to write you a lab order for the blood work and stool test. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. They will give you instructions on how to collect the stool sample. It’s important to follow those instructions carefully. I'll have the results sent to me, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I have them, likely within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, dizziness, or a lot of blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Goodness. That sounds dreadful. Yes, yes, I understand. Severe pain, dizziness, lots of blood…I’ll remember. Though frankly, I’d rather avoid all that. Fine. I'll go get this done. Though I still think a pill would have been better. Alright then, I suppose I’ll see you again…hopefully not too soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Take care. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the results come back. .
