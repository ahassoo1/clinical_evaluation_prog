DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it's a bit of a funny thing, really. I just… I get full awful quick when I'm eating. Doesn't matter what it is, to be honest. Used to be able to put a plate away, now just a few bites and I feel like I ate a feast. It's been going on for… oh, a couple months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, you say. And it’s not specific to any one food?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Salmon, bannock, even just a little bit of soup... doesn't matter. It all feels the same. Like my stomach’s shrunk or somethin’. My wife, Elsie, she keeps tellin’ me I should eat slower, but I'm not a slow eater, never have been. It’s just… surprising, is all.
DOCTOR: Surprising, yes. And is this fullness accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… not that I can recall. No pain, no… upset stomach, nothin’ like that. Just full. Really quick. Sometimes a little tired afterward, but I'm an old man, so that could just be… well, old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. And has your weight changed at all recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… Elsie says I've lost a bit. Not a lot, mind you. Just a few pounds, she thinks. She's always keepin’ track of that sort of thing. I don’t pay much attention to it myself. I’m always busy with things, you see. Workin’ on the radio stuff. But yeah, she noticed.
DOCTOR: A few pounds lost with early satiety… Hmm. And you mentioned radio work?
PATIENT: Oh, aye. I do a bit of everything for the community station. Stories, interviews, announcements… Mostly Haida language stuff, keepin' it alive, you know? Used to be more involved, but these days… well, a body slows down. But it keeps me busy, keeps my mind sharp. Doesn’t involve much eatin', though!
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, Mr. Obarr, before we proceed, I need to ask a few questions regarding your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Elsie usually handles all that. I've had the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, but nothin’ serious. I had a bad flu a few years back, but that cleared up. Never had anythin' diagnosed, though. I don’t really believe in all that fuss. My parents lived long lives, healthy lives, and they didn't bother much with doctors either.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Broke my arm when I was a boy, fallin' out of a tree, but they just put it in a cast. Elsie's had her share, a hip replacement a few years back, but me? Clean as a whistle, surgery-wise. Still got all my original parts, mostly. Though they're gettin' a bit worn, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, concerning your family history… were there any instances of cancer, particularly of the stomach or esophagus, in your parents or siblings?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother… she passed when I was young, from somethin' with her heart, I think. My father lived a long time, but I don’t rightly recall what took him. Just… old age, I guess. We didn’t talk much about illnesses back then. Wasn’t the custom, you see. And I don't have any siblings. So, no, not that I know of. I wish Elsie was here, she’d remember all that better than me.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, regarding your current medications… are you taking anything at all, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. When they're acting up real bad. It's… I don't even know what it's called, some sort of cream. Elsie gets it for me at the store. And I take a multi-vitamin now and then, but mostly I just try to eat healthy. Salmon, vegetables... things like that. Not much for pills, me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Obarr, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. It's standard procedure, and will help me assess your condition more thoroughly. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I should have come sooner, but I thought it was just… a funny thing, this gettin' full so quick. Go ahead, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just lie down on the table, please. I'll start with listening to your abdomen. Normal bowel sounds. No obvious abnormalities there. Now, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Soft, non-tender abdomen. No masses detected. Slightly diminished sensation in the epigastric region, but not concerning at this time. Throat appears clear. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Mr. Obarr, based on this initial examination, and your reported weight loss, I believe we need to investigate this further. While it could be something benign, the early satiety and weight loss warrant further investigation. I’m concerned about the possibility of a structural issue, or perhaps something affecting your gastric emptying.
PATIENT: Structural issue? Gastric… what now? That sounds… serious. What sort of things are you thinkin’, Doctor? Is it… cancer? Elsie's always worryin’ about that. She lost her sister to it, you see. I just… I thought it was just me gettin' old. What kind of tests are we talkin' about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, I understand your concern. It is important not to jump to conclusions. "Structural issue" simply means something may be affecting the normal anatomy of your digestive system. Gastric emptying refers to how quickly food moves through your stomach. It could be anything from a minor blockage to a slower digestion rate. While it is possible, though unlikely given your age and lack of other symptoms, that this could be related to a malignancy, we cannot rule it out without further investigation. I am going to refer you to a gastroenterologist for an endoscopy. This involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera that is inserted into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining. It's the most definitive way to determine the cause of your symptoms. We will also need a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health. This form has the gastroenterologist’s contact information. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I will also have my nurse draw the blood samples before you leave. Do you have any questions, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Endoscopy… that sounds… unpleasant. And blood tests… well, I don't like needles. But if you think it's best, I suppose I should do it. What… what if they do find somethin’? What happens then? And how long does all this take? I’ve got things to do, you know. Radio stuff. I promised Old Man Hemlock I'd record his stories. Elsie won’t be happy if I’m off doin’ tests all the time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it is important to focus on obtaining a diagnosis first. Speculating about potential treatments before knowing the cause of your symptoms is unproductive and will only increase your anxiety. The endoscopy typically takes about 30 minutes, and you will be sedated, so you won't feel any discomfort. Afterwards, you will need someone to drive you home. The blood tests will only take a few minutes. If anything is found, the treatment options will vary depending on the nature of the issue. It could range from medication to a minor procedure. We will discuss all your options in detail once we have the results. I understand you have commitments, but your health is paramount. Delaying diagnosis could have serious consequences. I recommend prioritizing these tests. My nurse will explain the scheduling process. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I suppose not. Just… it’s all a bit much, isn’t it? Elsie will be mad. She always said I should have gone to the doctor sooner. Alright. I’ll… I’ll make an appointment. And tell the nurse to… well, to be gentle with the needle. Thank you, Doctor. I think. I just hope it’s nothing serious. Really hope.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be with you shortly.
