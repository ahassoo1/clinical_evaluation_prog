DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nooruddin. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective gear. I have some…difficulties with them, and I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. It's not that I want one, you understand. I fully appreciate the need for safety, especially these days. It’s simply… they don’t quite work with me, if that makes any sense. I'd be happy to explain the specifics. It’s a bit hard to put into words, honestly.
DOCTOR: Well, "doesn't quite work with you" is rather vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: You are quite right, Doctor. It is. I apologize for the lack of clarity. It’s… a feeling of being quite restricted, a pressure on my face, and it makes it difficult to breathe normally. More than that, it causes a fair amount of…discomfort, a kind of dizziness, if I wear one for any length of time. It’s not a panic, not exactly. Just…unsettling. I work with folks who need assistance, and I need to be calm and focused for them.
DOCTOR: So, you experience…discomfort, dizziness, and difficulty breathing when wearing a mask. And this interferes with your ability to perform your job. How long have you been experiencing this?
PATIENT: It started when the mask requirements began, about a year and a half ago, ma’am. At first, I thought it was just getting used to it, but it hasn’t improved with time. It’s consistent, every time I wear one. Even the lighter ones. And it lasts as long as I’m wearing it. It’s… unpleasant, to say the least. I haven't sought medical attention for it specifically, because I didn't want to cause trouble requesting accommodations without a formal diagnosis, if that makes sense. I hoped it would resolve on its own.
DOCTOR: So, no prior medical evaluation for this. And you're hoping I can just… write a note for you?
PATIENT: That’s…a fair assessment, Doctor. I wasn’t certain what the process would be. I was hoping you could help determine if there’s a medical reason that would qualify me for an exemption. I understand it’s not something to be granted lightly, and I wouldn't ask if it weren't causing a genuine problem. I’m willing to undergo any testing you feel is necessary to understand what’s going on, if you think that would be helpful. I just want to be able to continue doing my job safely, for both myself and the people I assist.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some basic information, then. Have you had any history of anxiety, panic attacks, or any other sort of breathing difficulties?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never. I’ve always been quite…steadfast, I suppose. No history of anxiety or panic. And my breathing has always been regular. I'm a fairly active man, as well. I spend a good amount of time outdoors. I've never been diagnosed with asthma or any other lung condition. My family history is… unremarkable, as far as breathing issues are concerned. Everyone lives a good long life, for the most part. It’s truly this mask that’s causing the trouble.
DOCTOR: And what sort of masks have you tried?
PATIENT: I've tried… well, most of the common kinds, I believe. The standard blue surgical masks, the cloth ones – I’ve tried several different thicknesses and materials with those. I even attempted one of those N95 respirators, but that was… particularly uncomfortable. It felt very restricting, and the dizziness was much worse with that one. I've tried adjusting the fit, loosening them, tightening them, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. It’s the feeling of having something covering my face, I think, more than the fit itself. It’s a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Just to rule out anything obvious. Sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths in… and out… again… Alright. Lungs sound clear to me. No wheezing, no crackles. Oxygen saturation is… 98%. That’s perfectly normal. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72, regular. Everything looks normal, frankly.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. I suppose that makes this more… perplexing. It’s frustrating, to feel unwell when all indicators suggest otherwise. Is there anything else you’d like to check? Perhaps a test for allergies, or something related to the sinuses? I'm not opposed to further investigation, if you think it would be beneficial. I’m just eager to understand what’s causing this discomfort and find a solution.
DOCTOR: Allergies are unlikely to be the cause, given the consistency of the problem and the lack of other symptoms. And sinuses seem unrelated. Honestly, Mr. Knabenshue, this sounds… entirely psychological. It’s a fairly common reaction these days. A lot of people struggle with anxiety about masks.
PATIENT: I understand your assessment, Doctor, but I assure you, I have never struggled with anxiety. I’ve faced… significant challenges in my life, and have always been able to maintain a level head. While I acknowledge the current climate may contribute to general stress, this is a purely physical sensation, as far as I can tell. The pressure, the dizziness, the restricted breathing… those are not symptoms of anxiety I’ve ever experienced. I’m willing to consider other possibilities, but I respectfully disagree with that diagnosis. Perhaps there’s a nerve issue at play? Or something related to the facial muscles? I’m simply trying to understand what’s happening to my body.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm a doctor, not a magician. Everything is normal. I’m not going to start ordering a battery of tests for something that has no medical basis. It sounds like you’re having a… reaction to wearing a mask. It's unpleasant, I understand. But it doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. I can write a note stating you've been evaluated and have no underlying medical conditions that would preclude mask wearing, but I won't be writing an exemption note.
PATIENT: I understand your position, Doctor. And I appreciate your time and thoroughness. However, simply stating I have no “underlying medical conditions” doesn't address the actual discomfort I am experiencing. To be clear, I am not seeking to avoid a responsibility; I am seeking a solution that allows me to continue my work safely and effectively. With all due respect, writing a note that acknowledges my discomfort, even without a formal diagnosis, would be a more helpful course of action than one that dismisses my concerns entirely. It would allow me to engage in a productive conversation with my employer about potential accommodations. I am willing to explore alternative options, such as different types of masks or modifications to my work environment. But without some documentation of my difficulties, I fear I will be unable to do so. Would you be willing to consider a note that simply states I've been evaluated, am experiencing discomfort when wearing masks, and that further discussion of accommodations may be warranted?
DOCTOR: Fine. I will write a note stating you’ve been evaluated and are experiencing discomfort while wearing masks. However, I will also state that no underlying medical condition was identified and that psychological factors may be contributing to your symptoms. And I’m not going to recommend any specific accommodations. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand your need to document potential psychological factors, and I respect your position. A note acknowledging my discomfort and mentioning that further discussion of accommodations may be warranted is a helpful starting point. Thank you for your time and consideration. I trust you will have the note ready shortly? And if I may ask, what is the best way to obtain a copy for my records?
DOCTOR: Here. It's a standard form. I’ll make a note in your chart as well. The office will fax a copy to your employer if you provide the number. Otherwise, you can pick up a copy at the front desk. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This will be helpful. No, that is all for today. I appreciate your time, despite our… differing perspectives. I wish you a good day, Doctor Nooruddin. And thank you again for your assistance. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye. .
