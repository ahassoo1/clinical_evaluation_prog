DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Itching can be very disruptive. A little while now… could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? Around the middle of June, I’d say. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying, mostly on my arms and back. But it's slowly gotten worse and spread. It's pretty much everywhere now, except… well, not on my face, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, starting in June. And it hasn’t responded to anything you’ve tried – lotions, creams, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I tried some regular moisturizer, you know, the stuff for dry skin. Didn't help. Then I got some anti-itch cream from the drugstore, the kind with hydrocortisone in it. That took the edge off for maybe an hour, but it came right back. It's like it doesn't even notice the cream, really. I stopped using it after a few days, didn't seem worth it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the moisturizer and hydrocortisone didn't provide sustained relief. And you mentioned it’s not on your face…are there any other areas it doesn’t seem to affect?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… my palms and the soles of my feet seem okay. It’s weird, it’s not completely all over, but pretty close. My hands and feet… that’s it. Everywhere else, pretty much. Even between my fingers and toes, it's itchy. It's just… a constant thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. The distribution – or lack thereof – is important. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the itch?
PATIENT: Accompanying it… like what? I’m not sure I understand the question, Doctor. Is it about… like, other symptoms? Is it rashes, or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, other symptoms. Any changes in your skin – bumps, redness, blisters?
PATIENT: No, no bumps or blisters. The skin just looks… normal, really. Maybe a little dry in places, but that's it. No redness. It's not like a rash at all, it’s just… itchy. I mean, I can see little scratch marks now, obviously, from me scratching, but that’s new. Before that, it was just the itching. It's really frustrating because there’s nothing to see, you know? It’s all just under the skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. No visible rash, just the itch. And the itch has been present for about six weeks now, beginning in June, and spreading gradually. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse – certain foods, activities, soaps, detergents?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I’ve been eating pretty much the same as always. I did switch laundry detergents a few months ago… around May, maybe? A new brand, a “sensitive skin” one, actually. But I didn’t think much of it. Could that be it? It’s just…it feels like it's everywhere, you know? Like it wouldn’t just be the laundry. But I suppose it's worth considering. I haven't changed anything else. No new soaps, no new activities...just the detergent.
DOCTOR: Alright, a laundry detergent change in May. It's possible. Now, let's briefly go over your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, actually. A bit of arthritis, getting on in years, but nothing serious. Nothing that would cause an allergic reaction, definitely. I don't take any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for the arthritis when it flares up.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, some arthritis, occasional pain reliever. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, perhaps a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing recently. Last cold I had was… oh, last winter, I think. Nothing major, just a regular cold. Didn't last long. And before that… I honestly can’t remember. I rarely get sick. My wife… well, she was always the one getting sick. But me? I’m pretty sturdy. It’s been quiet since… well, since she passed.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Ferneding. That must be difficult. Now, to get back to the itch, could you describe it?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is. As for the itch… it’s just… irritating. Not painful, exactly. More like a constant need to scratch. Sometimes it’s a little worse than others, but it's always there. It's all over, so it's hard to ignore. It’s not like one specific spot, it’s just… everywhere. Like tiny ants crawling under my skin, maybe? It's hard to describe, honestly. It doesn’t burn or sting, just… an incessant itch. It’s making me lose sleep, too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Ferneding, perhaps a quick examination would be helpful. If you wouldn't mind if I just take a look at the affected areas. That might give me a better idea of what we’re dealing with. It's mostly just to rule out anything obvious.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking the time to look at it. I just want to get it figured out. It’s been a real nuisance. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see... No visible rash, as you mentioned. Skin appears generally normal, no redness, no bumps, no blisters. Just a little bit of dryness in patches. And here as well… no visible signs of a dermatological issue. Skin appears intact, but I do notice some subtle excoriations – small scratches – consistent with your report of scratching. No swelling or warmth. No visible abnormalities on the legs either. Itching is widespread, as you say, but the skin itself doesn’t offer many clues. It’s… perplexing. Given the lack of visible findings, and the widespread nature of the itch, and the timeline, several possibilities come to mind. I’m thinking we should do some bloodwork to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Bloodwork sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Lotion, anything to help with the itching?
DOCTOR: While we await the results of the bloodwork, I would recommend trying an over-the-counter antihistamine – one that's non-drowsy if you need to be alert during the day. And a hypoallergenic moisturizer, fragrance-free, applied liberally after showering. Those may provide some symptomatic relief. However, I would also like you to stop using the new laundry detergent immediately. And, just to be absolutely thorough, I'm going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to use for a week. But only for a week, as long-term use can have side effects. I want to rule out anything serious first. We will re-evaluate the situation after the bloodwork comes back. Here are the prescription and the form for the bloodwork. You can take these to the lab at the hospital. They should be able to schedule an appointment quickly. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Thank you. Stop the detergent, antihistamine, moisturizer, cream for a week… got it. The hospital is close, so that's no problem. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for before my follow-up appointment?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. If you notice any fever, chills, night sweats, or any new symptoms alongside the itching—especially any changes in your skin, such as blisters, pus, or significant redness—please contact the office immediately. And if the itching becomes unbearable, or interferes with your sleep or daily activities to a severe degree, don't hesitate to call. Otherwise, we’ll proceed with the bloodwork and discuss the results at your follow-up appointment, which I’m scheduling now for two weeks from today. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks from today is perfect, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough. And thank you for listening. It's a relief to finally have a plan. No fever, chills, or blisters... and I'll call if things worsen. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. It was my pleasure. It’s important to me that you feel heard and that we address your concerns effectively. I’m glad we have a plan in place. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Get well soon. .
