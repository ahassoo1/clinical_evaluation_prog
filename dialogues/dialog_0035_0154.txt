DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I keep getting trouble with my water, you see. It happens… often. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, just that it’s been bothering me for a while now. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, “trouble with your water.” Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More…? Oh dear. It… burns, when I go. And I have to go so often. Even when I haven't had much to drink. It's a… a nagging feeling, always. It wakes me up at night, sometimes. And it's… uncomfortable, to say the least. I don’t know if that explains it well enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequent urination even with limited fluid intake, and it's disrupting your sleep. That gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Blood…? I… I don't recall. It’s been a while, you see. Everything gets a bit… muddled. And pain… maybe? A little ache in my back, sometimes, but I thought that was just from… being old. I do a lot of bending and lifting at work, fixing those… those big houses on wheels.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific recollection of blood in the urine, some back pain that you attribute to your work. And you mentioned you do some heavy lifting in your job. Let’s talk about your work a bit more. What kind of lifting are we talking about, and for how long each day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it’s the RVs, you see. Recreational Vehicles. Big ones. I fix the insides, the plumbing mostly. And sometimes… sometimes things are heavy. Water heaters, tanks… I have to get under them, move them around. I don’t know exactly how long each day… a few hours, probably? It's hard to say. I lose track of time. It's a good job, though. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re doing some fairly strenuous work with plumbing and lifting in RVs. That's helpful. Now, let’s go back to your water troubles. Aside from the burning and frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm… Sometimes it smells… funny. Not a bad smell, exactly, but… different. And… sometimes I feel a bit shaky, a little weak. But I thought that was just from getting older too. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a different odor to your urine and some weakness or shakiness. I'm noting all of this. Do you have a fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills… not usually. I haven't been sick to my stomach either. No, I don’t think so. I mean, maybe a little queasy sometimes, but that’s just… from everything. It all feels a bit mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask some more general questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed in the past – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a hard one. I saw a doctor years ago, but… I can’t recall exactly what they said. I think… maybe something with my blood pressure? But I don't take any pills for it now. I don’t remember ever being told I had anything with my kidneys, no. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat… reasonably well.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure in the past, but currently not on any medications. And no known kidney problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see… Yes! I had my… my appendix out, a long, long time ago. When I was young. And… I think I had something on my eye removed once, but it was very minor. Just a little growth. That’s all I can remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a minor growth removed from your eye. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Not a single pill. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it. I believe in letting my body… handle things itself, as much as possible. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? No, I don’t think so. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes with dust, but that's not an allergy, is it? No, I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any medical conditions like diabetes, kidney problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… that was a long time ago. My mother… she had problems with her heart, I think. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. And my brother… he had diabetes, yes. That's all I really remember. It was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle…? Well, I work, you see. A lot. Fixing those RVs. I live alone now, after the divorce. I don’t really have much time for… hobbies. I try to eat well, like I said, and I walk a little bit when I can. It's… a simple life. I don't drink or smoke. I'm not one for a lot of excitement.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see. But please, do whatever you think is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, please have a seat on the table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart sounds are regular, but I can hear some mild crackles in your lungs, which could be from a number of things. Your abdomen is soft, but you do have some tenderness in your lower abdomen on the left side. I'm going to order a urine test to check for infection and other abnormalities, and a blood test to evaluate your kidney function and look for signs of inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests…? Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But please, don't let it take too long, Doctor. I have to get back to work. Crackles in my lungs… that doesn’t sound good. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, I must admit. Very well. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. We'll get those results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever for the abdominal discomfort. And I want you to drink plenty of fluids over the next few days, even if you don't feel thirsty. We’ll review the test results when they come back, and then we can discuss a more definite plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions…? No, I don't think so. Just… how long will the tests take? And will they hurt? I really need to get back to work. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you seeing me, but I haven’t got much time to spare.
DOCTOR: The blood test should only take a few minutes, and the urine sample is quick as well. There may be some mild discomfort with the blood draw, but it shouldn’t last long. As for how long it takes to get the results, it usually takes 24 to 48 hours. The nurse will give you instructions on where to go for the blood work. I'll call you with the results as soon as they're available. Given your age and the symptoms you're experiencing, and your family history, I also want to rule out a few other possibilities. I'm going to go ahead and schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, just to be on the safe side. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Next week…? Oh dear. That is a long time. I really don't have time for a follow-up. I have work, you see. I barely have time for this. But… …if you think it’s absolutely necessary, I suppose I can try to make it work. But please, keep it brief. I appreciate your help, Doctor, but I’m a busy woman. Just get me fixed, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand you’re busy. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. We'll discuss the test results and come up with a plan. If anything changes, or if you develop a fever, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact the office immediately. Here's a prescription for the pain reliever, and these are the instructions for the blood work and urine sample. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… try to be quick, if you can. I really need to get back to work. Thank you for your time. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Claudene. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
