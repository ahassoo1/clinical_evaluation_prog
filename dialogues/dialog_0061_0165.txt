DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Brege, welcome. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I've been getting fevers... keep comin' back, ya know? It's a bother, really. I just want to figure out what's goin' on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, fevers that keep coming back – that is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Sure. They don't come every day, nothin' regular like that. Maybe once a week, sometimes two weeks apart. They usually start in the evenin', feel kinda cold and shivery at first, then I get hot. Not real high, I don't think. I haven't actually taken my temperature, if that makes sense. Just feel warm, ya know? And tired. Real tired. Then it usually breaks overnight, and I feel okay for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're intermittent, happening maybe once a week or every couple of weeks, starting with chills and then feeling warm, and breaking overnight. And you feel tired with them. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or anything that makes them better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... trigger? Not that I've noticed, no. I've been workin' pretty steady, same routine for months. Not been travelin' or nothin'. Makes 'em better... honestly, just sleepin' it off. And drinkin' plenty of water. That's about it. I haven’t been takin' anythin' for 'em, figured they'd just go away on their own. They usually do, for a while, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent routine, no recent travel, and rest and hydration seem to help. And they do resolve on their own, but they keep returning. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fevers?
PATIENT: Let me think... other symptoms... well, sometimes I get a bit of a headache when the fever starts, not a bad one, just kinda dull. And my muscles ache a little. Like I've been workin' too hard, even when I haven't. Not always, though. And... now that I think about it, I've been sweatier than usual, even when I'm just sittin' around. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so headaches and muscle aches sometimes accompany the fever, and you've noticed increased sweating. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' serious. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said I could manage it with diet and exercise, and I've been doin' okay with that. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, ya know? I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure managed with diet and exercise, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned aches and pains, but nothing specific beyond that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, knock on wood. Just a few broken bones as a kid, playin' around, but they healed up fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just some childhood broken bones that healed well. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. My mother had diabetes, I think. And my father... he had some heart trouble when he got older. And my sister… she has arthritis, real bad. But other than that, nothin' that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and arthritis. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything regularly right now, even over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, a small pill. The doctor gave it to me. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back when it's actin' up. That’s about it. I don't really like takin' pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for back pain. And you prefer to avoid taking medication when possible. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin'. I eat just about anything. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess. Look, doc, is this gettin' us anywhere? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I understand your concern about getting back to work, Mr. Brege, and we are getting somewhere. To help me get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your abdomen. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. Just get it over with, ya know? I got patients waitin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Let’s start with your temperature. Okay, your temperature is 100.4 Fahrenheit. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don't feel any masses. And I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are a little swollen, but not significantly. Alright, that’s all. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, you have a fever, a slightly elevated heart rate, and some mild swelling of your lymph nodes. We need to figure out what's causing the fever.
PATIENT: Alright. So... what now? Is it somethin' serious? I ain't got time for somethin' serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking. It's hard to say definitively right now if it's serious, Mr. Brege. These symptoms could be caused by a number of things, including a common infection like the flu or a cold, but the recurring fevers and swollen lymph nodes suggest we need to investigate further. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will check for signs of infection, inflammation, and other potential causes of your symptoms. We'll also check your blood cell counts. I'd also like to do a chest X-ray, just to rule out any problems with your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood tests and an X-ray? Look, Doc, I really don't like hospitals or doctors' offices. Is there any other way? Can’t you just give me somethin' for the fever and see if it goes away? I've felt fine before, and I'm sure it's just somethin' passin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Brege, and I truly wish we could just treat the symptoms and hope for the best. However, given your recurring fevers and swollen lymph nodes, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Treating the symptoms without knowing the cause could mask a problem and delay proper treatment. The blood tests and X-ray are the best way to get the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis and develop the right plan for you. We can do the blood tests here in the office, and I can send you to a nearby imaging center for the X-ray. It shouldn't take too long, and we'll get the results back relatively quickly. If the results come back normal, then we can consider other options. But right now, this is the most responsible course of action. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do the tests. Just... get it over with. But you better be quick about it. And don't tell me I gotta come back every week for more stuff. I got a business to run, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege, I understand. We'll get this done as quickly as possible. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood. And I’ll write you a referral for the X-ray. The imaging center is just a few blocks away. I’ll let the technician know you're ready. While you're waiting, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… hurry up, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll have the technician in right away. I will also give you the paperwork for the imaging center. Once you have the X-ray done, they can send the results directly to my office. We'll review them as soon as they come in and let you know what we find. Technician, can you come in here for a blood draw?
