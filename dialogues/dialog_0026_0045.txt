DOCTOR: Good morning, Enrique. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I keep getting...flushing. My face gets very red. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? Hard to say exactly. It just…happens. Not always, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing… happening for roughly a month now. That's good information to start with. It's often helpful to get a clearer picture of these things. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens… hmmm. That’s a good question. Not after exercise, definitely. And not when I’m…upset. Or angry. It seems to happen after I eat. Not every time, but…a lot of the time. Spicy food, maybe? But not always spicy. Sometimes just…regular food. Like rice and lentils. I don’t know. It's very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s often, but not always, after eating… and not necessarily linked to spicy food. Rice and lentils too, you said. That is a little unusual. Do you notice anything else happening at the same time as the flushing?
PATIENT: At the same time… Let me think. Sometimes my heart feels… a little fast. Not racing, just…faster than normal. And… my palms get sweaty. Just a little. Not soaking, but you can feel it. And… sometimes I feel a bit warm, all over. Not a fever, just…warm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, flushing, a slightly faster heartbeat, some sweating in your palms, and feeling warm… all around the same time as eating. It sounds like we're building a clearer picture. Do you experience any other symptoms at all – things like headaches, dizziness, or nausea?
PATIENT: No, no headaches. Not dizzy. And no… throwing up. Not sick to my stomach. Just the flushing, the warm feeling, and my heart. Oh! And sometimes…a little bit of…ringing in my ears. Very quiet, though. Not all the time. Maybe once or twice with the flushing. It goes away quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears occasionally. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, not much. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I had the usual childhood things, you know? Measles, mumps… but nothing serious. As I got older… nothing. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, a long time. Maybe ten years? More? My wife… she took care of everything. After she passed… I just… didn’t bother. I take nothing for anything. No pills, no medicine.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s good to know. No current medications, and haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time. And no known allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. Shellfish, peanuts, everything. Never had a problem. My wife used to joke I had a cast iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. My father… he was healthy too, mostly. He lived to be eighty. My sister… she has diabetes, but that's it. No one else… really. No heart problems, no cancers… just the usual old age things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your sister, and generally good health for the rest of the family. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I mostly stay at home. I like to read, watch television… cook. I don’t go out much. I used to garden, but… not anymore. I don’t smoke. Never have. I drink a little tea, maybe two cups a day. And I drink… sometimes a small glass of wine with dinner. Not every day, though. Maybe two or three times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, generally a quiet lifestyle, no smoking, moderate tea and occasional wine. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I haven’t been checked in a long time.
DOCTOR: Great. If you'd like to sit up here for me. Okay, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not drastically, but worth noting. And I can see some mild flushing on your cheeks. Skin temperature is normal. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. Everything seems generally okay, but the elevated blood pressure and the flushing are things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay. Investigate further… What does that mean? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean something bad, Enrique. Elevated blood pressure can have many causes, and flushing can be caused by various things, from diet to stress. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll check your thyroid function, your blood sugar levels, and some general markers of inflammation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. The blood tests are a routine step, and it's better to be thorough. I'll also give you a referral to a cardiologist, just as a precaution. They can do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and if everything comes back normal, we can discuss possible dietary triggers and lifestyle adjustments. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… That sounds…serious. Is my heart bad?
DOCTOR: It doesn't mean your heart is bad, Enrique. A cardiologist is a specialist – like seeing a skin doctor for your skin. We’re just being cautious because you mentioned a slightly faster heartbeat. The EKG is a simple, painless test that will give us a clearer picture of your heart’s electrical activity. It's a preventative measure, and it’s always better to rule things out. We’re not jumping to any conclusions. Would you like me to explain the process of the EKG in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me what it involves. I… I get nervous easily. Just knowing what to expect would help.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a very simple test. They’ll put some small, sticky patches called electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. These patches are connected to a machine that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t involve any needles or pain at all. You’ll just lie still for a few minutes while the machine does its work. It’s completely non-invasive, and it takes about ten to fifteen minutes. The technician will explain everything to you before it begins. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Patches… no needles. Just lying still. And the technician will explain it all. Okay. That doesn't sound so bad. What about the blood tests? Where do I go for those?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad that sounds a bit better. For the blood tests, you can go to the lab right across the street, at 123 Main Street. They take walk-ins, but it's always a good idea to call ahead to schedule an appointment, just to avoid a long wait. Their number is 555-1212. I'll give you a lab requisition form with the specific tests I want done. The results will usually be available in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they come back. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works fine. 123 Main Street… 555-1212. And you'll give me the form. Okay. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I was very worried, but I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. That’s my job. And you’re right to be proactive about your health. We'll take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure this out together. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all, before your follow-up appointment. Here is the lab requisition form. I'll see you in a week to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Enrique. Take care.
