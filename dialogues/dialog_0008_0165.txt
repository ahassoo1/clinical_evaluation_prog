DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just… been getting fevers, keep comin’ back. It’s been botherin’ me. Don’t know what’s causin’ ‘em, and frankly, I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, fevers coming and going. I understand you’d like to get to the bottom of this quickly. Can you tell me a little more about these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, they ain't like the flu. Not really achy, mostly just… hot. Comes on sudden, lasts a few hours, then I'm alright for a bit. Then it's back again. Happened maybe four times in the last month, somethin’ like that. I haven’t been keepin’ a perfect log, if that’s what you’re askin’. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty. "Annoying" is a perfectly valid way to describe it. About how high do the fevers get, if you've taken your temperature?
PATIENT: Shoot, I think… last time, my wife, Maria, took it. Said it was 101, maybe 101.5. But usually, I just feel warm, you know? Don't bother with the thermometer unless I’m really feelin’ bad. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Right, 101-101.5 when she checked. And you said it comes on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yep. Like a switch. I’ll be fine, workin’ in the office, and then… bam. Gotta go lie down. No chills or nothin’ beforehand, just… heat. And it usually happens in the afternoon, if I’m rememberin’ right. Though, one time it was in the mornin’. Like I said, it’s not consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, inconsistent timing, sudden onset. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these fevers, even if it’s not every time?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I been eatin' the same stuff, doin' the same things. Workin', gardenin', watchin' the ballgame... I even stopped eatin' those spicy empanadas, just in case. Didn't make a difference. It's a puzzle, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it lasts a few hours. When it breaks, do you feel completely back to normal, or is there any lingering fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Usually back to normal, yeah. Maybe a little tired, but nothin’ a good nap won’t fix. I don't feel sick afterwards, just… wiped out for a bit. It's not like the flu where you're achin' and miserable for days, understand? More like… a short circuit. Then everything's fine.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A “short circuit” is a good way to put it. Let’s go through some other things just to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fevers?
PATIENT: Like what kinda symptoms? I ain’t had a cough or nothin’. No sniffles, no sore throat. No rash. Just the heat. And maybe… a little bit of a headache sometimes, but not always. It's usually mild, too. It’s hard to say if it’s from the fever or just a regular headache, you know? I get those sometimes anyway.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual aches and pains for a fella my age. My back's been botherin' me a bit, that's why I’m a chiropractor, ha! But nothin’ serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble. I don't take any regular medication, either. Just aspirin if I got a bad headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, no ongoing conditions or medications. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, way back when. And I broke my arm once fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that, nothin'. No major surgeries, no nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm in childhood. What about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mom lived to be 88, Dad was gone too early, heart trouble. My sister, she's fine, lives in Florida. No major illnesses that I know of on either side. Everyone's pretty healthy, as far as I know. We don't really talk about that stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: What do you mean by that? I work, I got a garden, I try to eat right... I don't smoke, haven't for fifty years, and I only have a beer with dinner sometimes. I'm not exactly livin' wild, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Alright, fine by me. The quicker we get this sorted, the better. I got appointments this afternoon. Just try to be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit right now. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes. Any recent travel, or exposure to sick individuals?
PATIENT: Nah, haven’t been outta town in months. Just been around Maria, mostly. And she's been feelin’ fine. No sick kids, no nothin'. We mostly keep to ourselves. This is what’s got me so puzzled, Doc. I ain’t been anywhere, ain’t been around anyone sick. It's like my body’s playin' a trick on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Given the recurring fevers with no clear source, and the lack of other symptoms, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a viral infection that comes and goes, or something more unusual. To rule out some more serious conditions, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a basic inflammatory marker. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Ugh. Alright, I guess so. If it'll get to the bottom of this, I'll do it. Where do I go? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know so I can plan my schedule. I got patients dependin’ on me, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll send you to the lab down the hall – just tell them Dr. Cumper sent you. They’ll draw a few vials of blood. Results usually take 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if the fevers get worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – like a rash, severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Right, 24-48 hours. Down the hall. And call if it's bad. Got it. Hopefully it's nothin’ serious, Doc. I really appreciate you lookin' into this. I just want to get back to work. And maybe watch the ballgame in peace.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brege. We'll get to the bottom of this. Sarah will be in to get you set up with the lab request. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
