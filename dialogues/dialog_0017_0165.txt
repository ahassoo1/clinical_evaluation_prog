DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Blim. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Just been gettin' these fevers, comin' and goin'. It's been happenin' a while now, and honestly, it's kinda wearin' me down. I'd like to figure out what's goin' on, if you can help.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... oh, jeez, maybe six, seven months ago? Not every day, mind you. More like... every few weeks. Last one was, uh... Tuesday, I think. Yeah, Tuesday. Felt awful, chills, the whole nine yards. Then it's just gone for a bit. It's weird, see? That's why I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: “Every few weeks for six to seven months… intermittent fevers.” And what would you estimate the highest temperature you’ve recorded?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doc, I don't really take my temperature. My wife, Maria, she usually does when I'm lookin' really bad, but I don't always remember what she says. I just know I feel hot, real hot, and achy. Maybe 101, 102 when it's at its worst? I wouldn't swear to it, though. I just feel awful, you know?
DOCTOR: “Estimates are… unreliable, Mr. Brege. It's crucial to have concrete numbers for proper assessment. However, we can proceed. Aside from the fever and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, I get that. Numbers are good. Look, sometimes I get a real bad headache with it, right behind my eyes. And… sometimes, just kinda tired, for a few days after. Not just regular tired, but wiped out tired. Hard to explain. No cough, no nothin' like that, just… feelin' like somethin's runnin' me down. Oh! And I've been sweatier than usual, even when I'm not sick. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Headaches, fatigue, excessive sweating… Alright. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Well, Maria's been makin' me good food, like always. But… I ain't been as hungry, I guess. Not a huge difference, but maybe eatin' a little less. And I haven't stepped on the scale in a while, but my pants feel a little looser, if that tells ya anythin'. I wouldn't say I'm losin' weight fast, just… not as much appetite.
DOCTOR: “A subtle decrease in appetite and some weight loss… acceptable. Now, Mr. Brege, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, knock on wood. I see a chiropractor for my back, been goin' to the same guy for years. Just regular adjustments, helps keep me movin'. Other than that, just the usual old man stuff, ya know? A few aches and pains. Maria keeps tellin' me to watch my cholesterol, but I ain't been to the doctor for a check-up in a while.
DOCTOR: “A lack of preventative care is… concerning. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Not a fan of goin' under the knife, Doc. Always figured if it ain't broke, don't fix it. My wife always said I was stubborn, and she's probably right. But seriously, no surgeries, not ever. I've been pretty good at avoidin' hospitals, thankfully.
DOCTOR: “And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had high blood pressure, had to take pills for it. My father... he passed away when I was young, heart attack, I think. And my brother, he had some trouble with his diabetes, but he's doin' okay now, watchin' his sugar. That's about all I really know, Doc. My family wasn't big on talkin' about health stuff, if ya get my drift. Mostly just tried to ignore it and keep goin'.
DOCTOR: “Family history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes… Alright. Now, Mr. Brege, I need to ask about your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nah, never touched a cigarette in my life. Maria wouldn't allow it, even if I wanted to. She always said it'd shorten my life, and she's probably right about that too. I do enjoy a little rum on the weekends, maybe a couple of glasses with dinner, but that's about it. Not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: “Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Maria gives me some stuff for my back sometimes, ibuprofen, that kinda thing, and I ain't never had a reaction. She's usually pretty careful about that sort of thing. I trust her judgement, Doc. She knows me better than anyone.
DOCTOR: “Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.”
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Whatever you need. Just gotta be careful with my back, you know. This old body ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Please lie flat. I will begin with auscultation of your heart and lungs.” “Heart rate is regular, normal S1 and S2. Lungs are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles noted. Slightly elevated blood pressure, 145/90. Not alarming, but warrants monitoring.” “Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Slight discomfort upon deep palpation in the right upper quadrant. Do you experience pain in that area often?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes, yeah. Not a sharp pain, just kinda... achy, especially after I eat somethin' heavy. Maria says it's probably just indigestion, and she gives me some stuff for it. Usually goes away on its own, though. I don't really pay it much mind, to be honest. Just figured it was old age catchin' up to me. That's kinda where it hurts, right there.
DOCTOR: “Right upper quadrant tenderness… possible hepatomegaly, although difficult to assess definitively without further investigation. Now, let's check your reflexes.” “Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, within normal limits. No signs of neurological deficit. Finally, I’ll take a look at your throat.” “Throat is clear, no signs of infection. No cervical lymphadenopathy noted.”“Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, your symptoms are… nonspecific. The intermittent fevers, fatigue, and right upper quadrant tenderness could be indicative of a number of things.”
PATIENT: Nonspecific, huh? That don't sound good, Doc. So what kinda things are we talkin' about? And what do we do now? I was hopin' for a quick answer, maybe some pills or somethin', but this sounds like it's gonna be a whole thing.
DOCTOR: “As I said, Mr. Brege, the possibilities are numerous. It could be a mild viral infection, but the persistence of the symptoms is concerning. It could be a gallbladder issue, given the right upper quadrant tenderness, but we need imaging to confirm that. Less likely, but we must rule out other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound.” “These tests will help us evaluate your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any structural abnormalities in your abdomen.” “The results should be available within a few days. I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen for the aches and pains, and stay well-hydrated.”
PATIENT: Okay, Doc. Tests, follow-up, ibuprofen… got it. Sounds like a whole lotta stuff, but I guess that's what I came here for. So, uh... how much is all this gonna cost? I ain't exactly rollin' in dough, and Maria's been worried about the bills lately.
DOCTOR: “The cost will depend on your insurance coverage. However, as you are uninsured, you will be responsible for the full charges. The blood tests will be approximately $200, and the abdominal ultrasound is around $500. We do offer a payment plan, but you will need to speak with our billing department to arrange it.” “I will have the receptionist provide you with the necessary paperwork. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Five hundred dollars for an ultrasound? Jeez, Doc. That's... a lot of money. I gotta talk to Maria about this. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… paperwork, and talk to the billing department. And try to figure out how we're gonna pay for all this. Thanks, Doc. I guess I'll see you later.
DOCTOR: “Very well. The receptionist will assist you. Have a good day, Mr. Brege.” .
