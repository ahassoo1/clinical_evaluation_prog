DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Hilber. Dondre, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Dondre Hilber. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor… Osga, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Osga will do. Look, I’ve got a full waiting room, so if you could just get straight to the point… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Sorry. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there’s always some left. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It doesn't hurt, exactly… more like a feeling of… fullness, and then it just… stops. Even when I feel like there should be more. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I figured it was best to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is best to get things checked. Have you had any fever, chills, or back pain alongside this… retention, shall we say?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My back feels alright, maybe a little stiff sometimes, but that’s just from… well, from getting older, I suppose. Nothing bad, nothing new. I haven’t noticed any other changes, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the color, or the smell? I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. It looks… normal, I think. You know, like regular pee. I haven’t seen any blood or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right. “Regular pee.” Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Now, have you tried increasing your fluid intake, or perhaps… being more deliberate about emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: I drink water, yes. Not a ton, maybe I could drink more. And I try to… empty it all, but it just doesn't always happen. I try to relax, take my time, but it's like something is stopping it. I don't push too hard, though. I wouldn't want to cause myself any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: My… what now? You mean… going to the bathroom for that? It’s been… regular. No problems there, thankfully. Normal for me. Why do you ask? Is that connected to this?
DOCTOR: Everything is connected, Mr. Hilber. Constipation can sometimes affect bladder function. I need to get the full picture, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well, like I said, everything is pretty normal there. I eat my vegetables, you know. Not a lot of problems. I just thought this was about my water…
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just move on. Do you have any history of prostate problems, or any family history of prostate cancer?
PATIENT: Prostate… problems? I… I don't think so. I don't really know much about that. I'm a widower, and my wife passed a while back. I don't really know anything about her family’s health problems, either. We didn’t talk about things like that much.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. Just need to check your abdomen, and I'll do a digital rectal exam… just to feel the size of your prostate, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Is that really necessary? I… I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, it’s a standard procedure when you're presenting with urinary issues. It’s the only way to properly assess the situation. Are you refusing medical advice?
PATIENT: No, no, I’m not refusing. It's just… a little embarrassing, you know? And I’ve never had one before. Is it… is it going to hurt? And what are you even looking for, exactly? I just want to understand.
DOCTOR: Look, it will be uncomfortable, yes. But quick. I'm checking the size and texture of your prostate. A large or abnormal prostate can be the cause of your difficulty urinating. It's for your own good, alright?
PATIENT: Alright… if you say it's necessary. I just… wish there was another way. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Right. If you could lie on your side with your knees bent… and please relax. I'll let you know when I'm finished.
PATIENT: Okay. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Your prostate is… somewhat enlarged, but not severely. It feels a little firm, but there aren't any obvious nodules. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a PSA test to rule out infection or prostate cancer. We'll get those results back in a few days.
PATIENT: Okay. A urinalysis and a… what was the other one? A PSA test. And that will tell us if it’s infection or… something worse? Is a PSA test a blood test?
DOCTOR: Yes, a blood test. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer, but also other conditions. Don’t jump to conclusions, alright?
PATIENT: Right. No jumping to conclusions. I understand. So, I have to get my blood drawn? And then we wait for the results. How long will it take to get them, roughly? And… what happens if the results aren’t good?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 3-5 business days. If the PSA is elevated, we’ll need to consider further testing, possibly an MRI or a biopsy. But let's not borrow trouble, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. 3 to 5 days. No borrowing trouble. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think that’s all I’m thinking about right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk. Avoid caffeine and alcohol until the test. And drink plenty of fluids. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything, I believe. Thank you for your time, Doctor Osga. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get dressed, and have a good day, Mr. Hilber. The nurse will be along shortly to review the aftercare instructions. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. .
