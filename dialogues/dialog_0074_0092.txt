DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh. Dr. Reisig, you say? Nice to meet you too, I guess. Well, I’m…breathin’ ain’t easy no more. Feels like sandpaper in my mouth all the time, and my eyes feel like they’re gonna fall out. Just…dry. Real dry. Don’t ask me why, I don’t make the rules. Been happenin’ a little while now, gets worse when I…well, when I do stuff. Walkin’ mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Guilds. It sounds quite uncomfortable. So, you're experiencing shortness of breath and a significant dryness in your mouth and eyes, and you've noticed it's worse with activity, particularly walking. Just to clarify, when you say "shortness of breath," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Shortness…well, it ain’t like I’m gonna keel over or nothin’. Just…gotta think about breathin’, you know? Used to just…breathe. Now I gotta remind myself. And it’s…tight. Like somethin’s squeezin’ my chest a little. Not a lot, mind you, but it’s there. I used to walk all over the city, now I gotta stop every few blocks. It's…annoyin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s not a sudden, overwhelming shortness of breath, but rather a feeling of needing to consciously focus on breathing, and a tightness in your chest that limits how far you can walk. That's helpful to know. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Time…time slips away, you know? I wanna say…maybe six months? Could be longer. I ain't good with dates. Started slow, just noticed I was gettin' thirsty more. Then the eyes got scratchy. Then the breathin'. All kinda blended together. I remember… summer started gettin' hotter, maybe that’s when it got worse. I don't rightly recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradually worsening, potentially linked to the warmer weather. That’s a good starting point. And you mentioned increased thirst as one of the earlier symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes alongside these – like a cough, wheezing, any swelling in your ankles or feet, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Cough? Nah, not really. Maybe a little tickle now and then, but nothin’ to write home about. Wheezin’? No. Swellin’…hmm. My shoes do feel a little snug sometimes, but I figured that was just…old age catchin’ up to me. Appetite…eatin’ less, maybe. Not because I don’t want to eat, just…don't feel that hungry. Everything tastes kinda…flat.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant cough or wheezing, some mild ankle swelling, and a decreased appetite with a change in taste. That’s all helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure…the doctor told me somethin’ about that a long time ago. Gave me some pills. Stopped takin’ ‘em after a while, didn’t feel like I needed ‘em. Diabetes…no, don’t think so. Heart…I had a scare once, years ago. They said my heart was…beatin’ too fast or too slow, somethin’ like that. Had some tests, but everything was…okay. Mostly just try to ignore things, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. So a history of high blood pressure in the past, managed with medication at one point, and a previous cardiac issue that was investigated and determined to be stable. It's good you had those things checked out. Do you recall what type of tests were done for your heart, or approximately when this occurred?
PATIENT: Tests… oh boy. Lots of wires stuck to my chest. And that machine, beep beep beep. And they made me walk on that…treadmill thing. Felt silly. It was… a long time ago. Maybe fifteen years? Twenty? Everything kinda blurs together after a while, you know? Doctor said somethin' about a normal EKG, whatever that is. Just remember bein' tired afterwards. And they told me to…watch my salt intake.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like an electrocardiogram, or EKG, and a stress test. And you were advised to reduce your salt intake. That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. And…oh! I had a hernia fixed a long time ago. That was…painful. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and hernia repair in the past. Thank you. Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My sister, Elena, she’s still around. Lives in Miami, I think. Haven't seen her in years. My mother, she passed away a long time ago, when I was still young. Father the same. They… came from Cuba, you know? Had a lot of health problems, my mother especially. Lots of…aches and pains. Nothing specific, just…old age, I guess. She was always coughin’ a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So your mother had a history of coughing, and generally experienced health issues related to aging. And you mentioned your sister is still living in Miami. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched the stuff. My mother hated it. Always said it was bad for your lungs. I used to drink a little, a couple of beers with dinner sometimes. But I cut back a long time ago. Didn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So you’ve never smoked, and you've significantly reduced your alcohol intake. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve taken some pills over the years, for headaches and such. Never had a bad reaction. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around…cats, but that’s about it. Not a serious allergy, just a little sniffle.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known significant allergies, just a mild reaction to cats. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Guilds. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Alright, I guess. As long as it don’t take too long. I got things to do, you know? But yeah, go ahead. Just…be gentle, okay? Old bones and all.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guilds. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 148 over 86, your heart rate is 82 and regular, your respiratory rate is 18, and your temperature is 98.6. Your heart sounds are a little diminished, but there are no murmurs. Your lungs have some slightly diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases, but no wheezing or crackles are immediately apparent. Your throat looks clear, and your oxygen saturation is 94%. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Your hands appear normal. Breath sounds are somewhat diminished bilaterally. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, your symptoms and findings suggest a few possibilities. The shortness of breath, dryness, and fatigue could be related to several factors, including your past medical history, and potentially some underlying issues with your heart and lungs. The ankle swelling is also something we need to investigate further. I think it would be helpful to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a…chest X-ray? Sounds… serious. But, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just want to feel normal again, you know? It's…tirin’ me out, all this breathin’ and dryness. So, yeah, do whatever you gotta do. But be quick about it, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. And I assure you, we’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. The tests will help us determine the best course of action to get you feeling better. Okay, I'm ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and the results should be available within a few hours. In the meantime, I’d like you to avoid strenuous activity and drink plenty of fluids. If your shortness of breath worsens significantly or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Oh, jeez. I hope it don't come to that. Fluids, okay. I can do that. Questions… hmm. Will these tests… will they tell me what's wrong? Will I need… surgery? I don't like surgery. And how long will I have to wait for the results? I got appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Guilds. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what might be causing your symptoms. The blood work can help us identify any underlying infections, anemia, or electrolyte imbalances. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart, looking for any abnormalities. As for whether you'll need surgery, it's too early to say. We need to see the results of the tests first. We'll discuss all your options once we have a better understanding of the problem. I want to assure you, we’ll explore all non-surgical options first. The lab results should be available within an hour or two, and the X-ray results will be available shortly after that. We'll review them together as soon as they’re ready. I will have my nurse, Sarah, come in to check on you, and she will let you know when the results are ready. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: Sarah, you say? Alright. An hour or two… I guess I can wait. Just… don’t let it drag on too long. I got things to do, you know. And… don't go givin’ me any of that fancy medical talk. Keep it simple. I don't understand half of it. No, I think that’s it. Just… get me feelin' better. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guilds. I will certainly keep things simple and explain everything in a way that you can understand. And I promise we will work as quickly as possible to get you feeling better. I’ll leave you to rest comfortably for now. Sarah will be in shortly to check on you. If you feel any worse or have any questions, please don’t hesitate to let her know. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Guilds. We'll get to the bottom of this.
