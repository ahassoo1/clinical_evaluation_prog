DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness lab panel, if that’s what this visit is for. I just… well, I like to keep an eye on things, you know? Make sure everything is still working as it should be. At my age, one wants to be proactive, eh?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A proactive approach is excellent. So, you’re here for your annual wellness check and lab panel. That's perfectly fine. To start, have you had any significant changes in your health since your last check-up?
PATIENT: Significant changes… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I’ve been feeling quite well, all things considered. Perhaps a little more tired some days, but I attribute that to the… well, the garden. My wife and I have been putting in a rather large vegetable patch this year. It’s good exercise, but it does take it out of you, you know? Nothing that a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. No new aches or pains, no unusual… incidents. Everything is functioning, as they say.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And how about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite is… robust, Doctor. My wife, Elena, is an excellent cook, and I enjoy my food very much. I haven’t lost any weight, if that’s what you’re asking. In fact, I may have gained a little, though I wouldn't want to say for certain. We have a lot of arepas at home, and I am partial to them. A very Venezuelan staple, you understand. Delicious!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urinary function?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, those are… personal questions, aren't they? But yes, to answer directly, everything is… regular. No difficulties there. Everything moves along as it should, if you’ll forgive my bluntness. And the same with… urinary function, yes. No issues. Perhaps a little more frequent at night, now that I think about it, but I attribute that to drinking more water. It’s important to stay hydrated, you know? Especially in this heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I take a small dose of lisinopril, prescribed by my previous doctor, for slightly elevated blood pressure. Nothing significant, just a precaution, you understand. And I do take a daily multivitamin, just to cover all the bases. Elena insists on it. As for allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, no. I've never had a severe reaction to anything. I’ve eaten shellfish my entire life, no problems. No hay fever, no skin irritations… I believe I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I'm not particularly prone to allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My father… he lived to be 87, which is quite good for a Venezuelan man, if I may say so. He passed away from a heart condition, I believe. My mother… she suffered from diabetes later in life, but otherwise was quite healthy. She lived to 82. On Elena’s side… her father also had diabetes, and her brother had some issues with high cholesterol. No history of cancer, thankfully, on either side of the family. We've been relatively fortunate, all things considered. Though, one can never be too careful, can one? It's good to be vigilant.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Just a quick exam now, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Then we'll get those lab results ordered. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise completely. I am happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I'm a rather sturdy man, but I appreciate your care nonetheless. I'm prepared for the exam.
DOCTOR: Okay, first, I’m just going to check your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Good. 140 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming given you mentioned a history of high blood pressure. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears… Everything looks normal there. And just opening your mouth for me... Your throat looks clear as well. No obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: That sounds… reassuring, Doctor. I am glad to hear everything is… functioning as it should be. It is good to know. You have a very… efficient manner, I must say. Now, about those lab results… what exactly are we looking for? Just out of curiosity, of course. I'm not a medical man, you understand. I just like to have a general understanding of things.
DOCTOR: Of course. We're ordering a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels – LDL, HDL, and triglycerides – to assess your heart health risk. And a complete blood count, to evaluate your red and white blood cells. Plus a PSA, as you are of an age where it is prudent to screen for prostate health. It’s a standard wellness panel, really. Gives us a good baseline to monitor your overall health. Do you have any questions about any of those tests specifically?
PATIENT: PSA… yes, I believe my previous doctor mentioned that. Prostate health, you say? Sensible, yes, very sensible. No, I don't believe I have any specific questions, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. A good baseline, you said? Excellent. So, what is the next step? Do I need to fast before these tests? And where will they be performed? I hope it isn't too inconvenient. I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. Not that I am complaining, of course!
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. No food or drinks except water. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. They can draw the blood this morning. It shouldn't take too long, maybe 15-20 minutes. I'll send the order electronically to them now, and they’ll be expecting you. Once the results are back – usually a few days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. Fasting for 8-12 hours, room 203, and a follow-up appointment… I can certainly manage that. A very efficient system, I must say. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and thoroughly. I feel much more… reassured now, if I may say so. You’ve been very… professional. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I go to the lab? Any specific instructions? I wouldn't want to jeopardize the results.
DOCTOR: Just stay hydrated, and try to relax before the blood draw. Sometimes anxiety can affect the results slightly. And let the lab technician know you're here for a wellness panel ordered by Dr. Piet. Otherwise, just go down to room 203, and they'll take care of you. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and thoroughness. I appreciate your care and attention to detail. I shall go down to room 203 now and have my blood drawn. I trust everything will be in order. Have a good day, Doctor Piet. .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Mombrun. We’ll be in touch soon with the results. .
