DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, it's a bit awkward to talk about, but a friend suggested I come in about... well, she called it PrEP. Something to help prevent HIV. I don't really know much about it, but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask. I'm 55, and... things change, you know?
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's certainly… becoming more common. Alright. Now, Ms. Trefren, let's be clear. PrEP is a preventative measure, and it’s good you’re thinking proactively. But it's not something to just start without a proper assessment. First, tell me… what prompted your friend to suggest this?
PATIENT: Oh, well, she's...very informed, let's say that. And she just said with things being...more open now, and people being more active, it’s good to be careful. She wasn’t specific, honestly. Just said it was a good idea to talk to a doctor. I haven't...been with anyone new recently, if that’s what you're getting at. It's just... better safe than sorry, right? I'm not looking for trouble, and I don't want to need it, but it's good to know my options.
DOCTOR: “More open” is… an interesting way to put it. Regardless, it’s responsible of you to consider this. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to be informed. Before we proceed any further, I need to understand your risk factors a bit better. You said you haven't been with anyone new recently. How recent is “recently”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It’s been... almost two years, I suppose. Maybe a little longer. Since my sister passed, truthfully. I just haven't...had the energy, or the inclination. But that doesn't mean I haven't been with anyone at all, you know? Just... not anyone new. And, well, before that, it was a very long-term relationship. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at dates and timelines.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a long-term relationship ended some time ago, and you haven't had new partners in approximately two years. That’s helpful. Now, Ms. Trefren, I’m going to ask some potentially sensitive questions, and you’re welcome to decline to answer anything you're not comfortable with. Have you ever been tested for sexually transmitted infections – STIs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's...a bit embarrassing to admit. No, I haven't. Never have. Back when I was younger, things weren't talked about so openly, and with my ex-husband, we… well, we just assumed everything was fine. And after that, I haven't really… needed to, I guess. Is that bad? Should I have? I feel like I should have, but I just...didn’t. And I don't even know what tests to ask for, honestly. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Trefren, but unfortunately not uncommon, especially given your generation. The fact is, STI testing is important, regardless of relationship status. And assuming is never a good practice. Before we discuss PrEP further, we absolutely need to get a baseline STI screening. I'll order a comprehensive panel – that includes HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and herpes. It’s standard procedure. We'll also need a blood draw to check your kidney function and liver enzymes, as PrEP can affect those. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible, really. I mean, if I'm going to even consider this PrEP thing, I need to know everything's okay first, don't I? Kidney function and liver enzymes… okay. That’s a lot of tests, but if that’s what’s needed, then so be it. When can I get these done? And will Medicare cover all of this? I’m on Medicare, so I need to know what I'm getting into financially.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the STI screening and the blood work, assuming it's deemed medically necessary – and in this case, it is. The lab will bill Medicare directly, but there may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. As for when you can get these done, we have a lab technician available this afternoon. I can write you a referral now, and they can draw the blood right here in the clinic. It will take about 30 minutes. While we wait for the results, we can discuss PrEP in more detail – the potential side effects, how it works, and whether it's truly the right choice for you. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. This afternoon works great. Thirty minutes… that’s not bad at all. And yes, please, tell me everything about the PrEP. Side effects… everything. I want to be fully informed before making any decisions. I'm not one for surprises, you see. So, you said the lab technician is here in the clinic? That’s good. I don’t like going to lots of different places. It's all a bit… tiring, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab technician is right down the hall, Room 3. I’ll print out the referral form for you now, and a brief explanation of the tests. As for PrEP… it's a daily pill – currently, the most common medication is tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine. It’s highly effective at preventing HIV transmission, when taken consistently. However, it’s not foolproof. And, as with any medication, there are potential side effects. The most common ones are nausea, diarrhea, headache, and fatigue. These usually subside within the first few weeks. Less common, but more serious, side effects can include kidney problems and bone density loss, which is why we’re doing the blood work. It also requires regular monitoring – STI screening every three months, and kidney function tests at least twice a year. It’s a commitment, Ms. Trefren. I want you to understand that completely before proceeding. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot. Every three months for STI checks? And kidney tests twice a year? That is a commitment. And what if I forget to take the pill every day? Does it stop working immediately? And this bone density loss… that sounds scary. I already have some arthritis, I don’t need anything else going wrong with my bones. Honestly, it’s sounding more complicated than I thought. Is there…an injection version, maybe? I’m terrible with pills, I really am. I forget everything these days. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is an injectable version, cabotegravine. It’s given every two months, after an initial series of injections. However, it's… significantly more expensive, and not all insurance plans cover it. Also, there have been reports of injection site reactions, and it requires a longer appointment time. As for forgetting the pill, consistency is crucial. If you miss doses, the medication’s effectiveness decreases. It doesn’t stop working immediately, but it reduces your protection. And yes, missing doses is a common issue. As for your arthritis, we would monitor your bone density regularly if you were to start PrEP – both the pill and the injection. Honestly, Ms. Trefren, given your concerns about adherence and your existing medical conditions, I'm starting to question whether PrEP is the right choice for you at this time. It requires a significant lifestyle change, and if you’re not able to commit to that, it’s simply not effective. Perhaps we should discuss other preventative measures, such as safe sex practices, and focus on regular STI screening. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: You’re right, you know. I don’t think I could commit to all of that. All the pills, all the appointments… it’s just too much. I thought it would be a simple solution, but it sounds terribly complicated. Safe sex practices… well, at my age… It’s probably not a realistic concern. And to be honest, I think my friend was a little…overenthusiastic. She’s always trying new things. Maybe I should just forget the whole thing. Regular STI screening… that sounds sensible, I suppose. And I can always ask questions if…if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. I’ll go to the lab technician now, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll write you a referral for STI screening, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to discuss the results. And please, don't hesitate to come in sooner if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon, Ms. Trefren.
