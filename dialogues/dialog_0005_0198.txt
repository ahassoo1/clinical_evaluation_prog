DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve been thinking… I keep hearing about mindfulness and meditation, and it sounds… peaceful. I work out on the tracks, you know, fixing signals and switches. It’s good work, but it can be stressful, and I thought maybe learning to quiet my mind a bit would be helpful. I’m just interested in learning more, really.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. I read a little bit online, and a friend mentioned it helps with… well, with just generally feeling calmer. Honestly, I’m not even sure where to start, or if it's even right for me. I’ve never really done anything like that before. Do you think it could help someone who… spends a lot of time focused on making sure trains don’t… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, I’m a doctor. I deal with medical issues. Stress is… a part of life. And frankly, a little bit of pressure keeps things running smoothly. I’m not sure I’m the best person to advise you on… relaxation techniques. It sounds like you might benefit more from talking to a therapist or counselor. Have you considered that?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I didn't realize it wasn't something you… covered. I thought maybe with the stress people feel, doctors might know a bit about things that help. I’m sorry to take up your time then. A therapist… yes, I suppose I could look into that. I just… it's hard finding someone you trust, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not that I don't know about it, it's just… not my area of expertise. I focus on things I went to medical school for. Blood pressure, cholesterol, things you can measure. And frankly, you look perfectly healthy. BMI is a little high, but nothing alarming. Are you experiencing any actual physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. No, not really. No aches, no pains, no… anything like that. I sleep okay, I eat… reasonably well. It’s just… a feeling. A bit of… restlessness, I suppose. Like my mind is always running a little bit ahead. That’s why I thought mindfulness might help. I hadn’t thought to mention it before because I didn’t think it was… important enough, compared to something you could see on a test. So, if it’s not something you can help with… should I just… go? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you came in here talking about feelings and mindfulness. You're a grown woman. You're not presenting with a medical complaint. I'm not going to spend my appointment time discussing… subjective experiences. Now, is there anything actual you want me to examine?
PATIENT: No. No, I… you’re right. I apologize. I shouldn't have bothered you with this. It was foolish of me to think… never mind. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I’ll… look into other options. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, have a good day, Ms. Sugino. And try to get some exercise. That's always a good start. .
