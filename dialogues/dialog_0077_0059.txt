DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Adyn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It's...nice to meet you too, I think. Um, well, honestly, it's a bit hard to explain. I've been having trouble with my speech, it seems. It's been...slurred, I suppose. Not all the time, but enough to be worrying. I'm not entirely sure when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I see. Slurred speech… and you're unsure of when it began. That's alright, we'll try to piece things together. Could you describe when you notice it most?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… It seems worse when I'm tired, definitely. And… perhaps when I've been talking for a while? Like, if I'm giving instructions at the worksite, sometimes people have to ask me to repeat myself. But it’s not constant, you understand? It comes and goes. It's all rather… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with fatigue, and with prolonged speech. Intermittent, you said. Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this slurred speech?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. Perhaps a little… dizziness, sometimes? But I work on construction sites, Doctor, so I often feel a bit off-balance. It’s hard to say if it’s related. Oh! And maybe my… my hands feel a little clumsy sometimes, but again, lifting and carrying all day... it could just be that. Honestly, it’s hard to separate things out. I don’t recall anything particularly new or alarming, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Dizziness, potentially related to your work… and clumsiness in the hands. Alright. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s… a bit difficult, actually. I don’t really have a regular doctor, if I’m honest. I usually just… deal with things as they come up. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose, but nothing major. I think I broke my arm once when I was little, but that's about it. I have Medicare, so I’ve had check-ups now and again, but nothing… consistent. My husband usually handles all of that. I’m afraid I’m not very helpful in this regard. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It's very common. We'll work through it. And it's good you do have Medicare; that's a good start. Any past surgeries, even the arm fracture if it required an operation?
PATIENT: Oh, the arm… yes, it did require an operation, I think. A long time ago, when I was a child. It was a bad break, apparently. I don’t remember much about it, honestly, just the cast and being very uncomfortable. No other surgeries that I'm aware of. Honestly, Doctor, I’m afraid my memory isn't the best. My husband keeps track of all these things, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. A childhood arm fracture requiring surgery. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… tricky. My mother passed away when I was young, and my father… well, we weren't very close. I don’t really know much about his side of the family. I know my grandmother had… something with her heart, I think, but I don’t know what, exactly. And there was an uncle… on my mother's side, maybe… who had diabetes, perhaps? It’s all very vague, I’m afraid. I never really asked, and no one ever talked about it much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You’ve told me what you know, and that’s perfectly alright. Vague family history is not uncommon. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I don’t smoke, never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with my husband on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. I work on construction sites, Doctor; I need to be alert and focused. Besides, my husband wouldn't allow it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. No food allergies, no environmental allergies… I don't think I'm allergic to anything. My husband would know for sure, he’s the one who usually handles my prescriptions. But honestly, Doctor, if I was allergic to something, I'm not sure I'd even recognize it. I’m truly not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your neurological exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Then I'll take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Please just relax. First, could you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Just tell me if you need me to adjust my position. I hope I'm not making this difficult.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine. Just keep your gaze on my finger. Good. Now, I'm going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that alright? I don't want to hurt you.
DOCTOR: That's good, thank you. Now, I'm going to ask you to resist as I try to push down on your arms. Just hold firm, don't push back, just resist the movement. Okay, on this side… and now this side. Good. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your tendons. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Alright. And finally, let’s check your balance. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Of course. I'm a little unsteady on my feet sometimes, Doctor, as I mentioned. Is this alright? Should I hold onto something?
DOCTOR: You're doing fine, just stand comfortably. I see a slight unsteadiness, which, as you mentioned, is likely related to your work. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breath sounds are clear, and heart rhythm is regular. Throat looks clear, and eyes appear normal. Overall, the physical exam is largely unremarkable, however, I am noticing some mild difficulty with coordination and balance. For documentation purposes: Neurological exam reveals mild difficulty with balance and coordination, but no focal weakness or sensory deficits. Reflexes are normal, and strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Breath sounds are clear, and heart rhythm is regular. Alright, Adyn. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I believe we should order some further testing to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Further testing? What kind of testing, Doctor? Is it something serious? I must admit, I’m starting to feel a little anxious now.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Adyn. It's best to be thorough, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. I'd like to order a blood test to check for any underlying medical conditions, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. The MRI will help us look at the pathways in your brain that control speech and movement. Would you have any concerns about undergoing an MRI scan?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… a bit daunting, Doctor. I’ve never had one before. Is it… painful? And what exactly are we looking for? I don't do well with enclosed spaces, if that matters. I suppose my husband can come with me, if that’s allowed?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Adyn. MRIs can be a bit intimidating if you’ve never had one before. It's not painful at all, it's a bit loud, and you'll be lying flat for about 30-40 minutes. The machine does create a rather confined space, so your concern is valid. It’s very common to feel anxious in there. Yes, your husband can absolutely accompany you - that’s encouraged! They can be right there with you during the scan. As for what we are looking for, we're trying to rule out any possible causes for your slurred speech and difficulty with balance, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, or any other neurological conditions. The MRI will give us a detailed picture of your brain and help us determine the best course of action. Would you like me to provide you with some information about the MRI procedure and what to expect?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be very helpful. Knowing what to expect would certainly ease my mind. And knowing my husband can be with me is a great relief. It’s just… a little frightening, Doctor. I don't like being unsure. I suppose, if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. Just… please explain everything very carefully. And when can we schedule it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Adyn. That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m printing out some information about the MRI procedure now, and I’ll also give you the contact number for the radiology department so you can speak with a technician if you have any further questions. Here you are. Let's see… scheduling. We can get you an appointment at the radiology center downtown next week, either Tuesday or Thursday. Which day would be better for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday would probably be better. My husband has some commitments on Thursday. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the scan? And will the results be available quickly? I’m hoping we don’t have to wait too long to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Tuesday it is. As for preparation, please refrain from eating or drinking anything for at least two hours before the scan, and remove any metal jewelry or accessories. The radiology center will provide you with detailed instructions when you confirm your appointment. The results typically take 24-48 hours to be reviewed by the radiologist, and then I'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I understand your anxiety about waiting, Adyn, and I'll do my best to expedite the process. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, severe headache, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. I suppose, for now, there’s nothing more I can do but wait, and try not to worry too much. I'm ready for the referral paperwork, if you have it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Adyn. That's the right attitude – try to take it easy. And I'll be right here when you're ready to discuss the results. Here’s the referral form, along with the radiology center’s contact information. Please take it with you and call them to schedule your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
