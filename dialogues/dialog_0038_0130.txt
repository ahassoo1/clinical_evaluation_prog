DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my sister… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother… she had something bad with her heart. So, I… I just want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don’t want the same thing to happen to me. I haven’t felt bad, but… it’s in the family.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's completely natural to feel that way when you've seen loved ones go through health challenges. It's good you're being proactive about your own health. We can definitely go through a check-up and discuss any concerns you have. To get started, can you tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm… I work. Sales. Lots of driving. I eat… okay, I guess. Not much time for fancy cooking. Sleep is… alright. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good. I get tired, you know, like anyone does after a long day. Nothing special. No pain, no… nothing like that. Just… old. I’m 73. Things get old. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Schwer. It gives me a good starting point. It sounds like you're generally functioning well, but understandably a bit anxious given your family history. Let's just go through a few more questions to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight… not really. Maybe a little bit. I think I’m… thinner than I used to be. But I don’t weigh myself every day or anything. It’s hard to say for sure. I lost my wife a few years back, and… I don't cook for myself much anymore. Maybe that's it. Not a big change, though. Just… less.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. Losing a loved one can really affect routines, and changes in appetite and weight are common. We'll keep that in mind. Okay, and how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy… like I said, I get tired. But everyone gets tired, right? Work is tiring. Driving is tiring. I don’t bounce around like a young man anymore, that’s for sure. But I get through the day. I can still do my job. Does that make sense? I don’t feel weak, just… regular old tired.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like your fatigue is consistent with your activity level and age. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my wife… she took me to the doctor when she was still alive. He checked me up. Said I was… okay for my age. Blood pressure was a little high, maybe, but he gave me some pills. I took them for a while, then… I forgot about them. I haven’t been to a doctor since. That was… a long time ago. Nothing bad, you know? I just don't get sick much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So, you were diagnosed with slightly elevated blood pressure in the past and were prescribed medication, but haven't been to the doctor in quite some time. And you haven't had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Right. No hospital. No big sickness. Just… the blood pressure. And I didn’t… keep taking the pills. I don’t like taking pills. And I felt fine. So I stopped. Is that… bad? I probably shouldn’t have done that, should I? I don't remember the doctor saying it was urgent or anything.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal to stop medication without discussing it with a doctor, Mr. Schwer, but I understand why you might have done that. We'll want to check your blood pressure today and see where things stand. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay. You think it's bad? The blood pressure? I feel fine. Maybe I should have just stayed home. My sister is the one who's sick. Not me. But… she said I should get checked. So here I am. Just… don’t tell me I need a lot of pills, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. We're just gathering information right now, and we’ll discuss all the options together. It’s good that your sister encouraged you to come in. Okay, just relax your arm and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. It's not critically high, but it is higher than we'd like. We'll want to monitor it over the next few visits and discuss lifestyle changes that may help, and possibly medication if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: 148… what does that mean? Is that… bad? My sister’s was… she had to go to the hospital. Is mine as bad as hers? I don't want to go to the hospital. I just want to know if I'm going to be okay. What do I need to do? Less salt? More… what? I don’t understand all this doctor talk. Just tell me straight. Am I in trouble?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, let's take a deep breath. You're understandably anxious, and I'll explain this as clearly as I can. 148/92 is higher than the ideal blood pressure, which is around 120/80. It means your heart is working a little harder to pump blood through your body. It doesn't mean you're in immediate danger, and it's not the same as your sister's situation. We don't know what caused your sister’s illness yet, and high blood pressure is different than whatever she’s dealing with. It does mean we need to take this seriously and make some changes to protect your health. Things like diet, exercise, and stress management can make a big difference. We can also discuss medication if lifestyle changes aren't enough. Let’s start with some simple things. Do you mind if I ask about your diet?
PATIENT: Okay… simple things. That’s good. I like simple. Diet… Um… I eat a lot of sandwiches. Lunch meat. White bread. Sometimes chips. I like chips. I don’t cook much, like I said. My wife… she did all the cooking. I eat out sometimes, too. Burgers, fries… the usual. I drink coffee. A lot of coffee. Does that sound… bad? I know I should eat more vegetables. But I don't really like them. And I’m always tired. It’s hard to cook when you’re tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, thank you for being honest with me. That gives me a good picture. The sandwiches, chips, and coffee are things we can look at. A diet high in salt and processed foods can contribute to high blood pressure, and caffeine can temporarily raise it as well. We don't need to make drastic changes overnight. Small steps are best. Perhaps we could start by trying to add one serving of vegetables to your diet each day?
PATIENT: One? Just one? That… I can do that. Maybe with dinner? I think I could… force down some peas. My wife used to make peas. But… what kind of exercise? I drive all day. Does that count? My back gets sore, you know. Driving is hard on the back. I don’t go to the gym. I don’t do gyms. Is this going to be hard? I just wanted to make sure I wasn't going to get sick like my sister.
DOCTOR: Okay, one serving of vegetables is a great start. And driving does involve sitting for long periods, which isn’t ideal, but it doesn’t count as exercise. We’re not aiming for a marathon here, Mr. Schwer. Something gentle is best. Even a 15-20 minute walk a few times a week can make a difference. And for your back, we can discuss some simple stretches or maybe a referral to a physical therapist if needed. It might take some effort, but it's about making small, sustainable changes to protect your health. I’ll also want to order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your cholesterol and kidney function. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… more tests. Okay. I guess. As long as I don’t have to fast for a week. I get shaky when I don’t eat. And… will the tests tell me if I’m going to get sick like my sister? That’s all I really want to know. If I’m okay. If I’m not going to… end up in the hospital. And… what about the medication? Do I have to start taking pills right away? I really don’t like pills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It's natural to feel anxious about all of this. The blood work will not tell us if you’re going to get the same illness as your sister. It will give us a baseline understanding of your overall health and help us identify any potential risk factors. It does require fasting for 8-12 hours, but we can schedule it for a time that’s convenient for you. As for medication, we’re not going to start you on anything right away. We’ll see how your blood pressure responds to lifestyle changes first. If those aren’t enough, then we can discuss medication options. We can also consider low-dose medication options if needed. For now, let’s focus on the blood work and starting with small changes to your diet and activity level. We'll monitor your blood pressure regularly and adjust our approach as needed. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay… small changes. No pills right away. Blood work… but not for the sister’s… thing. That… that sounds better. A little bit. So… what do I need to do? For the blood work? And… what kind of vegetables? Peas are okay? I don’t want to buy a bunch of stuff I won’t eat. And… how often do I need to come back? I don’t want to be here all the time. Just… tell me what I need to do. Simple. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, let’s break it down into simple steps. First, the blood work. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the test, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. I’ll give you a lab order and a list of instructions. We can schedule it for next week, perhaps on Tuesday morning?
PATIENT: Tuesday… morning. Okay. No food. Water. I can do that. And the vegetables? What kind should I get? And… how much? I don’t want to buy a whole garden. Just… something easy. Please. And… what about the coffee? Can I still have coffee? I need my coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with something very manageable. For vegetables, peas are perfectly fine! They're a good starting point. You could also try carrots or green beans – something you think you might tolerate. Aim for about a half-cup with dinner. And yes, you can still have coffee, but let’s try to limit it to one or two cups a day. Too much caffeine can temporarily raise your blood pressure, and it can interfere with your sleep. As for how often you need to come back, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to check your blood pressure and review the blood work results. If things are going well, we can extend the intervals after that. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: One month… okay. Half a cup of peas. One or two coffees. I think I can manage that. So… I get the blood work next Tuesday, and I try to eat some peas, and drink less coffee, and come back in a month? Is that it? I don’t want to forget anything. This is a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schwer, that is exactly it. You get the blood work next Tuesday, try to eat half a cup of peas with dinner, limit your coffee intake to one or two cups, and come back in one month for a follow-up appointment. I've written it down here for you. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything… simple. I appreciate that. I was really worried. Maybe… maybe I won’t get sick after all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I'm glad I could help. And I understand your worries, but you're taking positive steps, and that's what matters. Take care, and I'll see you next month. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up.
