DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, welcome. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s good to meet you too, Doctor. Though frankly, I usually don’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. It's just… my legs. They feel like jelly, really. It started a few days ago, after a terrible cold. Not that colds mean anything, everyone gets colds, but it's just so inconvenient. I can walk, but it’s… wobbly, you know? And it’s both legs, which is… odd.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is odd that it's both legs, and starting after a cold is good information. “Wobbly” is a good way to describe it. So, it sounds like weakness started a few days ago, after your cold. Can you tell me a little more about the cold itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a typical cold. Stuffy nose, sore throat, you know. Nothing special. I just… pushed through it. I don't have time to be laid up with every little sniffle. I run tours, Doctor. People pay me good money, and they expect me to be on, regardless of whether I feel a bit under the weather. It lasted maybe four or five days, and I thought I was over it. Then this leg weakness started. Honestly, I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It's a bit frightening, really.
DOCTOR: I understand – running tours is demanding, and being reliable is important. It’s good you pushed through, but it’s also good you're here now to get it checked out. So, the weakness developed after the cold symptoms subsided. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… fairly constant, but it worsens with activity, naturally. Like, if I’ve been walking around for a while showing people the sights, it gets noticeably worse. Then, if I sit down and rest for a bit, it eases up a little. Not completely, mind you, just… less bad. It's not like I can barely walk, but it's certainly not normal. It’s just… frustrating. And a little embarrassing, honestly. I don't want to look weak in front of my clients.
DOCTOR: That's helpful – worsening with activity and improving with rest. That gives us some clues. You mentioned it’s not like you can barely walk, so you’re still able to get around. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, no numbness, no tingling. My feet don’t feel particularly cold or anything. I haven’t dropped anything, thankfully, so my hands seem alright. I have been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? I mean, running tours is exhausting, regardless of any cold or leg weakness. I suppose… no, nothing else that really stands out. Just the wobbly legs and the fatigue. Though, now that you mention it, I have felt a little… achy, generally. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache all over. Probably just from overdoing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, no numbness or tingling, hands are okay, a little more tired than usual, and a general dull ache. That’s all good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, you know. But nothing chronic, nothing that requires regular medication. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. The doctor said it wasn’t a big deal, just needed to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no. I try to stay healthy, Doctor. I really do. I eat reasonably well, I get some exercise… running tours is exercise, isn’t it? And I definitely don’t go around looking for medical problems. Frankly, I avoid doctors as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, running tours certainly counts as exercise! It's good you've generally been healthy, and that your blood pressure issue resolved with lifestyle changes. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've managed to avoid those as well. I’ve always been… careful, I suppose. I don’t do anything too reckless. A few minor injuries here and there – a sprained ankle once, a twisted knee – but nothing that required a hospital visit or anything serious. I just… wrapped them up and kept going. Time is money, Doctor. I can’t afford to be laid up in a hospital bed. I have tours to run, people to show around.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That simplifies things. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a difficult one. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, but she didn’t take very good care of herself, to be honest. Smoked like a chimney, didn’t eat properly… It wasn’t terribly surprising, really. My father… he was healthy as a horse, never a day’s illness in his life. He was a farmer, very active. As for the rest of my family… I honestly don’t know. We’re not terribly close, and we don’t really discuss medical matters. It’s considered rather impolite, you know? Everyone keeps to themselves. It's not like we sit around swapping stories about our ailments.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some heart trouble, your father was healthy, and not much information on the rest of your family. That’s alright. Let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I wouldn't dream of it. Alcohol gives me a headache, and smoking… well, it's disgusting, frankly. And recreational drugs? Are you serious? I have a reputation to maintain, Doctor. I'm a professional tour guide. I need to be alert, responsible, and in control at all times. I can’t afford to be seen stumbling around in a haze. And frankly, I just don’t have time for such nonsense. I have tours to plan, people to entertain, sights to show. There simply isn’t room in my life for alcohol, drugs, or anything of that sort. It’s all a bit… uncivilized, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I've taken antibiotics a few times for colds or infections, and they've always been fine. I eat pretty much everything, although I prefer a good steak to vegetables, naturally. No bee stings, no rashes… nothing. I'm quite fortunate, really. I seem to be remarkably resilient. It’s just this leg weakness that’s bothering me, and frankly, it’s rather inconvenient. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t, and now I’m here wasting my time… although I appreciate you asking all these questions, I suppose. It’s just… time is money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. So, to summarise: you’ve had a recent cold, followed by weakness in both legs that’s constant but worsens with activity, improves with rest. No fever, numbness, tingling, or other neurological symptoms. You’ve generally been healthy, no chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, limited information on family history, no alcohol, smoking, or drugs, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, fine. Just get on with it, please. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow morning, and I really need to get back and finalise the itinerary. I’m not sure how long this is going to take, but I hope it doesn’t take too long. I suppose if you need to poke and prod, just get it over with quickly. I’m not particularly fond of being examined, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, if you would. And try to be quick about it. I have a reputation to maintain, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Relax your legs for me. Good. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your legs. Can you push your feet against my hands like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It feels a little… strained, honestly. I’m not sure I’m as strong as I used to be. It's probably just the tour season, you know. All the walking. It takes a toll on your legs, honestly. I've been running tours almost non-stop for months now. I haven't had a proper rest in ages. Perhaps that's what it is. Just… exhaustion. But still, it’s rather inconvenient. I need my legs to be strong. People pay me good money to show them around, and they expect me to be energetic and capable. It’s a matter of professional pride, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm just feeling for any areas of tenderness or muscle weakness. And now, I'll check your sensation. Close your eyes for me, and tell me when you feel me touch your legs. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, there. On the… outer part of my left leg. Just below the knee. And… now? Yes, there again. On the same spot. It feels… a little numb, actually. Not completely numb, but… diminished, perhaps. The right leg… feels normal, I think. More sensitive, at least. It's hard to say, honestly. I'm not particularly attuned to these sorts of sensations. I'm a tour guide, not a medical professional. But yes, the left leg feels… less sensitive than the right. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just… a quirk of my nervous system, perhaps. But it's a bit unsettling, nonetheless. It’s one thing to have wobbly legs, and quite another to have a leg that feels… diminished.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, I'm just going to check your gait – how you walk. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I’m not sure what you’re looking for, honestly. I walk perfectly normally, usually. Perhaps I’m a little unsteady, but that’s just because I’m being examined. It’s a bit unnerving, you know. Being scrutinised like this. It’s one thing to walk confidently in front of my clients, and quite another to walk awkwardly in front of a doctor. It’s… humiliating, frankly. But I’m trying to cooperate. Just… tell me when you’ve seen enough. I have a tour to prepare for, you know. I can’t spend the entire day being examined.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, Sharifa, that was helpful. Based on the exam, I noticed some diminished reflexes in both legs, some slight weakness, and a decrease in sensation on your left leg. Your gait appears somewhat unsteady. Now, it's important to rule out any serious underlying causes for your symptoms. Given your recent cold and the neurological findings, I want to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, inflammation, and nerve function. I also recommend an MRI of your lower back to rule out any compression of the nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds rather… excessive. I told you, I just had a cold. And now you’re talking about MRIs and blood tests? It’s probably just exhaustion, as I said before. All the walking. I’m a tour guide, not an athlete. I’m not used to this level of physical exertion. I’ve been running tours non-stop for months now. Perhaps I just need a vacation. A long, relaxing vacation. Look, I appreciate your concern, but frankly, I’m not convinced it’s necessary. I have a tour scheduled for tomorrow morning, and I can’t afford to spend the day in a hospital undergoing tests. It’s a matter of professional pride, you know. And frankly, I don’t have the time or the energy for all of this. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps some physical therapy? Or some medication to help with the leg weakness? I’d prefer something less… invasive, if possible. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little anxious about all of this. I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Sharifa. It does sound like a lot, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was important to rule out anything serious. Your symptoms could be due to exhaustion, as you suspect. However, the neurological findings – the diminished reflexes, weakness, and decreased sensation – warrant further investigation. We need to rule out conditions like vitamin B12 deficiency, nerve compression, or even early signs of neuropathy. These conditions can sometimes present with similar symptoms, and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. If you’re hesitant about the MRI right away, we can start with the blood work. It’s a relatively simple test and can give us some valuable information. We can then discuss the need for an MRI based on the results. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Blood work. But that’s it. No MRIs. Not yet, anyway. I need to know what the blood work reveals before I agree to anything else. And I need it done quickly. I can’t afford to spend the entire day in a hospital. And I want a clear explanation of the results. I don’t want any medical jargon. I want to understand what’s going on, and I want to know what my options are. And I still think it’s probably just exhaustion. All this talk about neuropathy and nerve compression… it’s a bit alarming, frankly. But alright, blood work. Let’s get it over with. Just please, make it quick. And explain the results in plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll do the blood work today. I’ll order the tests now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It should only take about an hour or so. And I promise, I’ll explain the results in plain English. No medical jargon, I assure you. We'll discuss all your options thoroughly once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend getting some rest and avoiding strenuous activity as much as possible. We’ll also discuss some over-the-counter pain relievers to help manage any discomfort. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your lab appointment. We’re here to help. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… get the blood work done quickly, and call me with the results as soon as possible. I have a tour to prepare for, you know. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a little anxious about all of this. Just… please, let’s hope it’s nothing serious. I have a reputation to maintain, and I can’t afford to be laid up in bed. Alright, then. I suppose I’ll go. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get you back on your feet quickly. Please, take care, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available.
