DOCTOR: Right. Denis Minatra, 67. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Memmolo. It’s about a test I had done… a GI Endo test, they called it. The results weren’t quite right, and my regular doctor suggested I come see you for a closer look. I received the paperwork just last week.
DOCTOR: A GI…endoscopy. Yes, I see it here. And your primary physician felt I should review?
PATIENT: Precisely. She said it was best to have a specialist take a look, and she recommended you specifically. I trust her judgment, of course, but I confess I wasn’t entirely sure what the test was showing, beyond “abnormal.” I’d be grateful if you could explain it to me in… layman’s terms, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: "Layman's terms." Of course. Well, it appears there were some…irregularities noted during the procedure. Inflammation, mostly. And a few polyps. Small ones, the report suggests. Now, don’t immediately panic. Polyps are…common. We need to determine if they’re anything to be concerned about. Do you have any history of digestive issues?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear about the polyps being common, thank you. As for digestive issues… not particularly. I’ve always had a fairly sensitive stomach, perhaps. Easily upset, you understand. But nothing chronic, no ongoing problems. My appetite has been a bit smaller lately, but I attributed that to…well, to getting older, mostly. And a little less energy, but again, age. I hadn’t connected it to anything serious until this test result, naturally.
DOCTOR: "Sensitive stomach." Vague, but… acceptable. And reduced appetite, fatigue… these can be a multitude of things. Has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. No blood at all. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I… I do pay attention to such things, if you understand me. But no, thankfully, nothing like that. It’s mostly just a feeling of fullness after only a small amount of food, and… well, a general lack of pep, I suppose. It’s not debilitating, certainly, but it is different than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. A few pounds, perhaps five or six, over the last couple of months. I hadn’t really thought anything of it, I just assumed it was the heat. It’s been rather warm, and I haven't had much of an appetite, as I said. I certainly haven't been trying to lose weight. It just… happened. Is that concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Five or six pounds, unintentional… yes, that is something we need to investigate further. Given your age and the findings on the endoscopy, we can’t simply dismiss that. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you'll allow me. And I’ll need to order some blood work. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a few others to get a clearer picture. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A physical exam and blood work… yes, I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, proceed at your convenience. I want to understand what’s happening, and I’m glad you're taking this seriously. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. No food or drink – water is permissible. We'll take those samples first thing tomorrow morning. Now, if you could just… lie down on the examination table, please. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and palpate it to assess for any tenderness or masses. It won’t be unpleasant.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Eight hours fasting, noted. I can manage that easily enough. I’ll lie down for you now. Please, don't hesitate to tell me if there’s anything I should be doing – or anything you want me to let you know about as you examine me. I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. Abdomen appears…distended. Not significantly, but present. Now, I’m going to gently palpate. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: That’s… a little tender, yes. Just there, on the left side. Not sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It’s been like that off and on for a couple of weeks, I suppose. I hadn’t really paid much attention to it, honestly. It comes and goes. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I apologize for being so… apprehensive. I’m not accustomed to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: The tenderness is… localized. It could be a number of things, of course. Muscular strain, even. But given the endoscopy results and your unintentional weight loss, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I also notice some mild guarding – you're tensing your muscles slightly when I press. Alright. That's enough for now. We'll get the blood work done tomorrow morning, and I’ll have the results sent to you within 48 hours. In the meantime, I’m going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It’ll give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… rather involved. Is that something I need to prepare for, Doctor? And will it be painful? I understand you need to gather as much information as possible, of course, but I confess I’m starting to feel… quite anxious. Is it possible it’s nothing serious? Perhaps just a minor inflammation? I truly appreciate your thoroughness, but the more tests you order, the more worried I become.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is relatively straightforward. You’ll lie on a table and a machine will take cross-sectional images. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye, which some patients find unpleasant. It is not generally painful. As for your concerns... it is important to be thorough. The CT scan will help us rule out or confirm various possibilities. I understand your anxiety, but at this stage, we cannot determine the severity without further investigation. It could be minor inflammation, yes. It could also be something more significant. Worrying will not change the outcome, but being proactive will. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear it’s not generally painful. And you’re right, of course, worrying won’t help. I suppose I’m simply… apprehensive about the unknown. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies to contrast dye. I’ve had scans before, many years ago, and I don’t recall any adverse reactions. Though, as I said, it’s been quite a long time. Is there anything specific I should do to prepare for the scan itself? Drink plenty of water, perhaps? And when can I expect to schedule it?
DOCTOR: Yes, drink plenty of water in the 24 hours leading up to the scan. This helps with visualization. You can schedule it through the radiology department. I'll send the order electronically now, and they’ll contact you directly to arrange an appointment. It's likely they’ll want to do it within the next few days. In the meantime, avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. I understand this is a lot to process, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I suppose… just one. Will these tests… interfere with my regular medication? I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, and a vitamin supplement. And… what if it is something serious? What sort of treatment would I be looking at? I apologize for asking such… direct questions, but I prefer to be prepared for all possibilities. Perhaps I am being overly anxious, but it's difficult not to worry.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure medication should not interfere with the tests. Continue taking it as prescribed. As for treatment… that depends entirely on the diagnosis. It could range from simple lifestyle modifications to more aggressive therapies. I understand your concern, but speculating at this point is unproductive. We need to have the results of the CT scan before we can formulate a plan. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss everything in detail. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’ll see you next week. .
