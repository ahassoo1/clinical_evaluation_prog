DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. But a friend suggested I look into something to help prevent HIV. I don't want to get into details right now, but I figured it’s better to be safe than sorry, you know? It’s called PrEP, right? That’s what she mentioned.
DOCTOR: Yes, PrEP – Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Trefren, and a very proactive step to consider. It’s good you’re thinking about this. To see if PrEP is right for you, I’ll need to gather some information. It's also important to rule out any other potential causes for your concern. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not anything major. I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, the usual aches and pains for someone my age, but nothing a doctor’s ever really diagnosed. Oh! And I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Mostly just… regular check-ups, honestly. I have Medicare, so they keep an eye on the big stuff. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and a previous bout of pneumonia. Thank you. "Regular check-ups" is helpful to know, and Medicare will have a record of those visits, which I can access. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. I’ve been pretty lucky, honestly. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but they just put it in a cast. That’s it. No cutting or anything like that. I’m not a fan of hospitals, to be frank.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Trefren. A cast doesn’t count as surgery. We'll keep everything as minimal as possible. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tough one. My parents passed away a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to my siblings. I know my father had high blood pressure, and my mother… she had diabetes, I think. But honestly, I don’t remember a lot of the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we didn't really talk about medical stuff much in my family. Is that okay? I feel bad I don't have more details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Trefren. It’s very common for family medical history to be incomplete, and it's understandable that you don't have all the details. High blood pressure and diabetes are good to know, though. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband – well, my late husband – he used to smoke, but I always hated it. Made me cough just being near him. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing regular. I don’t go out much, mostly just work and… quiet evenings at home. I work as a parking attendant, you know. Keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol, and working as a parking attendant. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the usual over-the-counter stuff. Pain relievers for my arthritis, when it flares up. And vitamins, a multivitamin. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, if that makes sense. I try to stay healthy, you know? I don't like relying on pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Trefren. Over-the-counter pain relievers and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose with certain flowers, but that's about it. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing serious. I think I’d remember something like that, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You certainly would. Okay, no known allergies. To determine if PrEP is a good option for you, we’ll need to do a quick physical exam and some lab work. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to… get this sorted out, you know? I trust your judgement, Doctor. Let's just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Trefren. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Then we'll draw some blood to check your kidney function and screen for any sexually transmitted infections. Could you please sit back and relax. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at this time. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Throat appears normal. No visible signs of infection. Now, I’m going to need to draw a small sample of blood. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. A little nervous about the blood draw, but… I can handle it. Just try to be quick, if you don't mind. And maybe tell me what you’re doing? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Trefren. I’ll explain everything as I go. I'm applying a tourniquet now to make your veins more visible. Then I'll clean the area with an alcohol swab. Now I’m using a small needle to draw a sample of blood. You may feel a brief sting. Alright, we’re all done. Just need to apply a little pressure here to stop the bleeding. Hold that firmly for a few minutes. We’ll send this sample to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days. While we wait for the lab results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Just… what happens if the results are good? What’s the next step with the PrEP, then? Is it a pill? And… does it have side effects? I’ve heard things.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Trefren. If your lab results come back normal, meaning no underlying conditions and no current STIs, then we can discuss starting you on PrEP. Yes, PrEP is currently taken as a daily pill. There is also a newer injectable form, but it’s not suitable for everyone. As for side effects, the most common are mild and temporary, like nausea, fatigue, or headache. These usually subside after a few weeks as your body adjusts to the medication. More serious side effects are rare, but can include kidney problems or bone density loss. That's why it’s important to have regular check-ups and blood work while on PrEP. We would monitor your kidney function and screen for STIs every three months. We will also discuss safe sex practices and other preventative measures. Do you have any other concerns about starting PrEP?
PATIENT: No… I think that explains it pretty well. Regular check-ups, I can do that. It's better to be careful, I guess. And it's good to know about the injectable one, just in case. I suppose… I suppose I’m willing to try it. Just… let me know when the results come back, okay? I don't want to have to keep calling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. I’ll have the lab results sent directly to me, and I will contact you as soon as they are available. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and, if appropriate, start you on PrEP. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And… I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel a little less… anxious about it all. I'll just be going now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Trefren. I’m glad I could help ease your anxieties. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
