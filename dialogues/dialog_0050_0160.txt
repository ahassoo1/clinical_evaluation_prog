DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, it’s about this… tiredness. It’s just gotten worse, and it’s embarrassing to admit, but I’ve been… eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, just little bits. It sounds ridiculous, I know. Can we just get this sorted out quickly? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, really. From the garden. Don’t look at me like that, it’s not like I’m enjoying it. It just… feels right, sometimes. And it doesn't help the exhaustion, obviously. I just…do it. It's hard to explain. Are you going to ask me a million questions about this?
DOCTOR: A thorough understanding of your symptoms is paramount, Ms. Hardenburgh, regardless of how… unconventional they may seem. While I understand your desire for expediency, certain inquiries are necessary to ensure accurate assessment and appropriate care. We will proceed systematically. First, let’s focus on this tiredness. Can you describe the nature of this fatigue?
PATIENT: Ugh, “nature of the fatigue”? Really? It’s just… tired. Bone tired. Like I haven’t slept in days, even when I have. It’s been going on for months, getting worse bit by bit. It’s not like I can barely function, yet, but it’s making everything harder. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I’ve always been a strong person. This is…undignified.
DOCTOR: And when did you first notice this tiredness beginning, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… last fall, I suppose. Around October maybe? It started slowly, just feeling a little more worn out than usual. I thought it was just the weather, you know? Then it didn't go away, and it just... kept building. I’m quite sure of it, I have a good memory for dates, unlike some people. Why does it matter so much when it started?
DOCTOR: Establishing a timeline is crucial, Ms. Hardenburgh. It allows us to correlate symptoms and consider potential causes. Now, beyond the fatigue and… clay consumption, have you experienced any other changes in your physical or mental state?
PATIENT: Mental state? What kind of question is that? I feel perfectly fine, mentally. A little… frustrated, maybe, with all of this poking and prodding. Physically… well, I've been a bit more short of breath lately, when I'm walking. And my appetite hasn't been the best, though I’m not losing weight, not that I have much to lose. Honestly, I just want a simple answer, not a whole life story investigation.
DOCTOR: Shortness of breath and decreased appetite… noted. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting personal, are we? Look, I don’t see what my… bathroom habits have to do with feeling tired and craving dirt. But fine, if you must know, they’ve been a little…off. Constipated mostly. It's probably just from not eating enough, and being tired. It’s common sense, really. I shouldn’t have to explain everything to you.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Hardenburgh, all of these inquiries are relevant. Now, let’s discuss your diet in more detail. Aside from a decreased appetite, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I usually have a piece of toast and coffee for breakfast. Lunch is often a sandwich – ham and cheese, nothing fancy. And for dinner… honestly, I don’t always bother cooking. Soup, maybe, or leftovers. I'm not one for elaborate meals. It’s simple, straightforward. I’ve never been a big eater, and honestly, these days I have even less desire for it. And, well, sometimes I have a little bit of clay. There, I said it again. Is that enough detail for you? Really, this is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications, vitamins, or supplements, Ms. Hardenburgh?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. I prefer to rely on my own strength, thank you very much. And I certainly don’t need any vitamins. I get everything I need from a balanced diet... well, mostly balanced. And I most definitely don’t take anything for this…problem. It’s not something you take pills for, it’s… a craving. A strange one, I admit, but not something a doctor can fix with a prescription.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the flu, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And a bad sprain in my ankle when I was young, playing netball. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a healthy woman, very strong. I don’t go to doctors unless I absolutely have to, and I certainly haven’t been diagnosed with anything…significant. Honestly, this whole conversation is a waste of time. You’re going to tell me I need to eat more vegetables, aren't you?
DOCTOR: And finally, Ms. Hardenburgh, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the faintest idea. My mother passed away when I was young, and I never knew my father. I had some aunts and uncles, but I wasn’t close to any of them. We weren’t a family that talked about… medical things. I doubt they had any… strange cravings like mine. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just trying to fill time. I have errands to run. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. It appears we have sufficient information for a preliminary assessment. I will need to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your vitals and then proceed from there.
