DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? Yes, well… it’s my… waterworks. They bother me. A lot. It’s been happening… on and off, for a while now. I don’t rightly remember how long. It's quite embarrassing, really. I just want it… stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. “Waterworks” – so issues with urination. It's alright, it is a common problem, and we can definitely try to figure out what’s going on. And you're right to get it checked out. You mentioned it's been happening on and off for a while. Can you describe what "bother" means exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it feels like I need to go all the time, even when I just have. And sometimes… it burns. A little. Not always, mind you. And sometimes… it’s difficult to… start. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. Everything just feels… irritated. I don't… I don’t know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Claudene. Frequent urination, a burning sensation, and difficulty starting… those are all helpful details. And it’s alright if you don't know the “fancy words,” we'll get there together. Is the burning sensation constant, or does it come and go with urination?
PATIENT: Oh… it comes and goes, Doctor. Definitely. It’s not… all the time. Mostly when I… you know. When I go. It doesn’t last long, but it’s… unpleasant. Honestly, I'm just tired of worrying about it. Is something seriously wrong? I’d rather not have tests, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Claudene, and wanting to avoid tests is perfectly reasonable. We’ll try to gather as much information as possible first. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me approximately how often you’re going to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That's… a difficult question. I don't count, you see. But… more than usual. I suppose. Before, I could go hours. Now… every couple of hours, at least. Sometimes even sooner. It really depends. It's a nuisance, really. It makes it hard to… go anywhere.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a noticeable increase in frequency, going more often than you used to, and needing to go more urgently. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… in the… you mean the color? I suppose it looks normal. I haven't… paid much attention, to be honest. It’s just… water, isn’t it? I haven’t noticed anything… unusual. Though, now that you mention it, maybe… a little cloudier sometimes. But I wouldn't swear to it. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. So, mostly normal color, perhaps a little cloudiness at times. And no blood or strong odor that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No… no blood, definitely not. And no… strange smells, either. I think. I wouldn’t know what a “strange” smell is, exactly. It smells like… water. Like it should. Oh dear, I feel like I’m not being very helpful, am I? I just want it to stop. It's unsettling.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Claudene. You’re telling me exactly what you’re experiencing, and that’s the most important thing. It's okay to not have all the medical terminology. Now, just a couple more questions about your general health, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I used to have… problems with my stomach, years ago. But that’s all sorted now, I think. And my knees… they ache. But that’s just old age, I suppose. No… nothing else comes to mind. I don’t see doctors much, usually. It's all very… unsettling. And expensive! I’m divorced, you see, and… well, never mind. It's not important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. History of stomach problems in the past, and some knee pain currently. And I understand your concerns about costs, and you don’t need to share details about your personal life. I just want to get a good understanding of your health. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh… just… for the knees, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. When they’re really bad. And… sometimes a little something for sleep. But not every night. Just when I can't… settle. I don’t take much, really. And I try not to. Everything has side effects, doesn’t it? It's all… worrying. I’d rather not take anything if I don’t have to. Honestly, Doctor, is this serious? I just want a simple answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Ibuprofen for knee pain, and something occasionally for sleep. It’s good that you’re mindful of side effects. It's difficult to give a “simple” answer right now without a little more information. Your symptoms could be a few different things. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, or something else. I would like to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. And then, I think it would be best to get a urine sample to send to the lab. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? And… a sample? I… I don’t know. I really don’t like doctors poking and prodding. And… having to give a sample… it's all so… embarrassing. I suppose… if it’s necessary. But could we… avoid the prodding, if possible? Honestly, Doctor, is it going to hurt? I’m not a brave woman, you see. This is all very… unsettling. I just want this to be over with. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Claudene. It's perfectly alright to feel nervous. The physical exam will be very gentle – I’ll just be listening to your abdomen and checking for tenderness. It shouldn't be painful at all. As for the sample, we have a private bathroom right down the hall, and I’ll give you clear instructions. It’s a standard procedure, and we do everything to ensure your privacy and comfort. I wouldn't recommend anything I didn't think was necessary. Would you like me to explain the procedure for collecting the sample?
