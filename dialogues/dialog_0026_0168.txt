DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t feel it was…necessary. I’m dating someone, and well, one must be thorough, wouldn’t you agree? Especially at my age. It’s not like when one is a young girl and can simply…trust. I want to be certain everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. That’s a very sensible approach. Taking care of your health, and being proactive about that, is always a good thing. And you’re right, things do change as we get older. We want to make sure everything is as it should be. So, to start, are you experiencing any specific symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. I assure you, I’m not ill. I simply want a…baseline, if you will. A confirmation that I haven’t…picked up anything untoward. I maintain a very…discerning lifestyle, but one can never be too careful, can one? It’s more a matter of peace of mind, really. Though, truthfully, his daughter is rather…particular. She's a nurse, you see. I need to be able to impress her with my…responsibility.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Peace of mind is a wonderful reason to come in. And wanting to make a good impression on his daughter, especially since she’s a nurse, is perfectly reasonable! Okay. So, let's get some information to give you that reassurance. I'll ask a few questions about your medical history, and then we can do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…efficient. Though I do hope it won’t be too disruptive to my schedule. I have a luncheon planned. And please, do be thorough. I don't want to have to come back unnecessarily. As for my medical history…well, I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, and a hysterectomy some years ago. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, the hysterectomy is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. Knowing your surgical history is important. And it’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. Let’s see… Do you remember approximately when you had the hysterectomy?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… 2008, I believe. Yes, 2008. Shortly after my eldest daughter started university. A rather unpleasant experience, truthfully. Though, one doesn’t dwell on such things. It was necessary, the doctor said. Fibroids, you know. Dreadful things. I do recall a lengthy recovery period, and…rather a lot of discomfort. But we won't rehash that, shall we?
DOCTOR: No, we certainly won’t rehash that. Thank you for that information. Knowing that helps me get a clearer picture. Now, aside from the hysterectomy, have you been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Absolutely not. I pride myself on avoiding hospitals whenever possible. A brief stay for observation after a rather nasty bout of the flu some years ago, but that hardly counts. And a tonsillectomy as a child, naturally. But nothing…significant. I’ve always been very careful with my health. I maintain a healthy diet, I exercise regularly, and I avoid…unsavory company. It's all about prevention, you see. Really, I’m rather surprised I’m even here today.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Prevention is key, absolutely. And it sounds like you’ve been doing a wonderful job of that. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Prescription medications? No. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. I find they…interfere with one’s natural equilibrium, you see. I take a multivitamin, of course. And occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that’s hardly…significant. I believe in letting the body heal itself, whenever possible. It’s all rather…natural, you see. I have a very holistic approach to wellness. Though, I do take a rather good probiotic. For…digestive health. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, a probiotic is important – gut health is very important! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I have a very…robust constitution. Though, I do find certain perfumes…overpowering. And I’m rather sensitive to dust. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction in my life. I’m rather proud of that, actually. It speaks to my…inherent vitality, you see. A healthy lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a mosquito bite last summer. But that’s hardly…significant, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a mosquito bite reaction wouldn't be considered a significant allergy. It sounds like you're generally very healthy and resilient. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my paternal grandmother had…arthritis. Dreadfully painful, from what I understand. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, had…diabetes. Type 2, I think. Though, truthfully, we weren’t particularly close. It’s all rather…distant, you see. I’ve always been careful to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned, so I don’t anticipate inheriting any of those…unfortunate predispositions. Really, I’ve always been the healthiest one in the family. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. It's good you're aware of those conditions. And it's excellent you're taking steps to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, I'd like to ask a little about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Absolutely not. The very idea! I find it…repulsive. And terribly unhealthy, of course. My mother smoked for a brief period when she was younger, but she quickly stopped. I’ve always been very careful to avoid such…detrimental habits. Really, I’ve always been a very…responsible individual. And I expect my companion to be the same, naturally. It's simply…common sense, you see. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's excellent. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Well, I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A lovely Chardonnay, perhaps. Or a Pinot Grigio. Nothing…excessive, of course. A social glass, you see. For relaxation. And to complement the meal. I wouldn’t dream of…overindulging. It’s simply…uncouth. Really, I’m quite moderate in all things. Is that important? I do try to maintain a certain…decorum, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. And yes, moderation is key. Now, one final question about your social history. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Is that…absolutely necessary? I came here for a general check-up, and to ensure…everything is as it should be. I hardly think my personal life is…relevant. However, since you insist… yes, I am dating someone. And, naturally, one engages in…appropriate activities. But I hardly think the details are…suitable for discussion. It’s simply…private, you see. Really, I find the question rather…impertinent. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, and I apologize if that question felt impertinent. It's standard medical practice to inquire about sexual activity when assessing overall health, as it allows us to properly assess risk factors and offer appropriate screening. It’s not about being nosy, but about providing you with the best possible care. Since you are dating someone, it's important to discuss STI screening. We can certainly do that today, as you mentioned initially. It’s confidential and routine. If you'd prefer to discuss specific risks privately, we can do that as well. Are you comfortable proceeding with STI screening?
PATIENT: Very well. If it’s…absolutely necessary for proper medical care, I suppose. Though I maintain, it’s hardly relevant. I’ve always been…discerning, as I’ve mentioned. But if it will alleviate your concerns, and provide me with…peace of mind, I suppose we can proceed. Though, I expect it will be…negative. Really, I’m quite certain. What exactly does this entail? Is it…painful? And will it be…discreet? I have a luncheon, you see, and I wouldn't want to…disrupt my schedule unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely discreet, and I'll make sure it’s as comfortable as possible. For women, it typically involves a urine sample, and sometimes a quick swab for certain tests. It's not painful, though you may feel a slight discomfort during the swab. It should only take a few minutes. We can also do a blood test as part of the screening if you'd prefer. Would you like to start with the urine sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample…yes, that seems…reasonable. Though I did have a rather large glass of water before coming here. Will that…affect the results? And where is the restroom? I do prefer a certain…level of privacy, you see. And I trust it’s…immaculate? One can’t be too careful, you know. Really, hygiene is paramount.
DOCTOR: Yes, a large glass of water might dilute the sample slightly, but it shouldn't be a major issue. We can always collect another one if needed. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. It is, of course, kept very clean. I’ll leave you to your privacy, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Just let me know when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I shall…endeavor to return promptly.
