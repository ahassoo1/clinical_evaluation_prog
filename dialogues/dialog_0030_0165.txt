DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just Clide is fine. Well, I keep gettin' these fevers. Comes and goes, ya know? Been happenin' a while now. Not fun, lemme tell ya.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. I understand you've been experiencing fevers that come and go. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure. They usually start in the afternoon, feel kinda shaky, then I get hot. Real hot. Then I sweat it out and feel okay for a bit, maybe a day or two, then it happens again. It's been goin' on... lemme think... since maybe April? It’s hard to keep track, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting in April. And you said they start in the afternoon, with shaking chills, then high fever and sweating. That’s helpful. Roughly how high do you think your temperature gets when you have a fever?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't taken my temperature, Doc. I don't own one. But I feel really warm, ya know? Like, really, really warm. Enough to where my wife, Elena, usually makes me soup and tells me to stay in bed. She worries. Probably 101, 102 maybe? I dunno, just a guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a guess of around 101-102 degrees Fahrenheit. And it sounds like these fevers are significantly affecting you enough that Elena is concerned. Have you noticed anything else that happens when you get these fevers?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. My joints kinda ache. Mostly my knees and my back. And I get real tired, like, can’t-get-off-the-couch tired. And... sometimes I get a headache with it, a real throbber. It feels like somethin's pumpin' in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint aches in your knees and back, fatigue, and a throbbing headache accompanying the fevers. Have you noticed any rash, cough, shortness of breath, or any changes in your bowel habits with these episodes?
PATIENT: No rash. No coughin' or trouble breathin'. And... no, nothin' different with my, uh, bathroom stuff. Everything's pretty regular, if ya know what I mean. It's just the fever, aches, and bein' tired, mostly. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. No rash, no respiratory symptoms, and regular bowel movements. Let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. Elena’s always tellin' me to get a check-up, but I usually feel fine except for these fevers. She worries too much, that woman. My back aches a little sometimes from bein' on my feet so long, but the chiropractor keeps it okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a child, and occasional back pain managed by a chiropractor. No other diagnosed medical conditions. Have you had any surgeries other than your appendix removal?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the appendix when I was little. No other surgeries. I try to stay outta hospitals if I can, ya know? Not my favorite place. This fever’s just been… persistent, that’s what’s got me worried now. It ain't gone away like it usually does.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries. And it’s good you’re coming in now, since the fever has been persistent. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And when my back really acts up, I take some ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing regular, Doc. I don’t like takin' pills if I can avoid it. Elena tries to get me to take somethin' for my knees, but I usually just rub some cream on 'em.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for back pain as needed. No other regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Elena gives me a hard time about tryin' new foods sometimes, but I ain’t never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much whatever she puts in front of me. She’s a good cook, that one. This fever’s got me feelin' weak though, so my appetite ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you've mentioned a decreased appetite with the fever. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like arthritis, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis I think. And my father… he had a bad heart, ended up needin’ a pacemaker. Elena's side, her brother has diabetes. That’s about all I can remember off the top of my head, Doc. We don’t talk about it much, to be honest. Makes people worry too much. This fever just feels… different than anythin’ I’ve had before.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis, heart disease, and diabetes. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that mean? I’ve been married to Elena for 40 years. We live in the city, not too far from here actually. I used to work construction, but I retired a few years back. Now I mostly just relax and try to stay outta trouble. And… I don’t smoke, never have. I used to have a few beers with my buddies sometimes, but I don’t much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, 40 years of marriage, retired from construction, live in the city, and a past history of occasional alcohol use but currently abstain. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: No pets, Doc. Elena wanted a little dog once, but I told her no. Too much responsibility, ya know? I’m happy just stickin' with Elena. She’s enough work on her own, ha! This fever's just been draggin' me down, though. And it's been comin' back so often. I really wanna get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pets. And I understand your concern. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your joints for swelling or tenderness. Then I’ll check your temperature and blood pressure. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, Doc. Whatever ya need to do. Just get it over with quick, if ya don't mind. I got things to do, ya know? Elena's makin' my favorite soup, and I don't wanna miss it. But do what ya gotta do. This fever’s just been… botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as quick as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but there are no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let me check your temperature. Okay, your temperature is 101.8. Now, let’s check your joints. Can you point to where you’re experiencing the most pain?
PATIENT: Ugh, 101.8, huh? That's not good. Okay, my knees are the worst. Both of 'em. And... kinda achin' in my lower back, right here. Feels tender when ya push on it. Not like a sharp pain, just… achy. Like I've been workin' too hard, even though I retired! It just feels stiff, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting mild tenderness and warmth in both knees and your lower back. No visible swelling. I can feel some stiffness as well. Your reflexes are normal, and strength appears intact. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. Please relax. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, your symptoms are concerning for a possible infectious process, potentially a viral or bacterial infection. However, given the persistence of your fever and joint pain, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order some blood work to help determine the cause. These tests will check for signs of infection, inflammation, and other potential problems. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh. I hate needles. But… if ya think it’s necessary, Doc. I just wanna feel better. What kinda blood work? Will it take long? I got soup waitin' for me. Elena’s gonna be mad if I’m gone too long. Not mad mad, but… disappointed. And how much will it cost? I ain’t insured, ya know. That’s another worry of mine. This whole fever thing is just… one thing after another.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needles and the cost, Clide. We’ll get through this. The blood work will involve a standard panel to check your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and inflammatory markers like your ESR and CRP. We’ll also check your kidney and liver function to ensure those organs are working properly. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes to draw the blood. As for the cost, since you are uninsured, the lab does have a payment plan available, and we can discuss that with the billing department. I will also write down the lab’s contact information for you. While we are waiting for the results, I recommend you rest as much as possible, drink plenty of fluids, and continue to manage your discomfort with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, if tolerated. I also want to rule out any possibility of Lyme disease, so I would like to order a Lyme disease test as well. Do you have any recent history of tick bites or outdoor activities in wooded areas?
PATIENT: Lyme disease? Tick bites? Nah, nothin' like that. I mostly stay inside these days, ya know? Used to go fishin’ with my buddies when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Mostly just relaxin’ at home. Restin’ and drinkin’ fluids… yeah, I can do that. Elena’s good at makin’ me rest. She’s a nag, but a good one. And I guess I can talk to the billin' people about payin' for the blood work. This is a lot, Doc. I just wanna know what’s wrong with me. How long will it take to get the results back? And will ya call me when they’re ready? I don’t wanna have to keep comin’ back here if I don’t have to. I got things to do, remember? Like… soup.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Clide. It is a lot, and I apologize for that. We’ll get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The blood work results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I will personally call you as soon as they are available. You do not need to come back unless I specifically request you to. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103 degrees Fahrenheit, you develop a severe headache, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, or any new symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doc. Thank ya. Just… call me when ya got somethin'. And tell 'em to be quick, okay? Soup ain't gonna stay warm forever. And… thanks again. I appreciate ya listenin' to an old man complain. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clide. It’s my job to listen and help. And don't worry, we'll get you answers. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and enjoy your soup. .
