DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses, yes. They are… bothering me. A lot of pressure, you know? It’s been… a while now. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it’s not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: A while… yes. It feels… full. Like something is blocking things. Mostly in my forehead, I think. And… sometimes my cheeks. It hurts when I bend over. Not bad bad, just… uncomfortable. I don't know if that makes sense. It comes and goes, but it hasn't really gone gone, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Fullness and pain with bending over are common with sinus issues. You mentioned it comes and goes, but hasn't really gone away. Is it constant, or does it flare up and then get a little better?
PATIENT: Flare up… yes, that’s a good way to put it. It’s better some days. Like, not hurting all the time. But then it gets worse again. Especially when the weather changes, I think. Or… when I’m tired. It’s hard to say for sure. Everything feels a little… mixed up, you know? I don’t remember things very well these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it’s worse with weather changes and when you’re fatigued. That gives us a clue. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure and pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… sometimes my nose feels stuffy. Not always, but often. And… I think I cough a little more than usual. But maybe that’s just… the dust? We live close to the fields, you know? It's hard to tell what is normal anymore. No fever, I don’t think. I don't remember feeling hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy nose and a cough, potentially related to dust. No fever that you recall. Have you noticed any colored discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Discharge…? Oh. Um… sometimes. Not a lot. It’s… yellow, I think. Or maybe green? It’s hard to say. I try to… blow it away, you know? I don’t really look at it closely. It’s not… a lot, but it's there sometimes. Especially when the pressure is bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow or green discharge with the pressure and pain… that’s helpful. Have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms so far?
PATIENT: Not really. I… I don’t take much medicine. Just… when I have a headache. And sometimes I try to rest. But it doesn’t seem to help much. My husband, he sometimes gives me tea. With lemon, you know? But… I don’t know if that does anything. I’m not good with remembering what helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over-the-counter headache medication occasionally and lemon tea. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. But… I don’t really remember ever taking much medicine, so I’m not sure. My husband says I’m a strong woman, and I don’t need much! But… I haven't tried anything new lately. No, I don't think I have allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history…? Oh dear. That’s… a hard question. I… I haven’t been to the doctor much. Not for a long time. I used to be very healthy. But… things are different now. I don't remember any big illnesses or anything. Just… the normal things, I guess. Maybe some colds when I was younger? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We can work through it. How about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. And I haven’t been to the hospital either. Not ever, I don’t think. I’ve been very lucky, I think. My husband always says I’m strong and healthy. He takes care of me very well. I haven’t needed to go to the hospital or anything. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family, do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like sinus problems, allergies, asthma, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother… she had some problems with her breathing when she was older. I don’t remember exactly what, but she coughed a lot. And my brother, he had… allergies, I think. To pollen, maybe? He always sneezed a lot in the spring. But… other than that, I don’t really know. We don’t see each other much anymore. It's hard to keep track. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some breathing problems and your brother had allergies. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh. Well, I live with my husband. We have a small farm. I help him with the animals and the garden. It’s hard work, but I like it. We eat mostly what we grow ourselves. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a little wine sometimes with dinner. We don’t go out much, but we are happy. It’s a simple life, but it’s good. I try to stay active, but I get tired easily these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Alright, Mikeisha, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’ll take a look at your sinuses and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just want to feel better. It's been bothering me for so long. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear a little bit of congestion. Your heart sounds normal. Now, let me take a look at your sinuses. Your throat looks a little inflamed, and your sinuses are tender to the touch. I also see some yellow discharge in the back of your throat.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is it… bad? I told you it was bothering me. What do you think it is, Doctor? I just want to know what's going on. And… what can I do to feel better?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, but it does sound like you have sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses, likely caused by an infection. The congestion, tenderness, and discharge are all consistent with that. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect it’s a bacterial sinusitis. Now, because you haven't been feeling well for a while and it’s not improving, I think you'd benefit from a course of antibiotics. However, I also want to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, just to be safe. Would you be open to getting a chest X-ray to make sure there’s nothing else going on?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… and a… X-ray? Oh dear. Is it that serious, Doctor? I don't like taking medicine if I don't need to. And… I don't like those machines. Is it very… dangerous? I just want to feel better, but I don't want anything too scary. And… is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The X-ray is just a precaution to rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia. It's a very quick and low-risk procedure. The amount of radiation is minimal. As for the antibiotics, they're the best way to clear up the infection causing your sinusitis. Regarding the cost, I know you don't have insurance. Let me see what the cost of the X-ray would be here at the clinic. It's $150. And a course of antibiotics would be about $30. We can also discuss some options for getting financial assistance if that’s a concern. We could also try a course of antibiotics without the X-ray first, but if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, we'd definitely want to get the X-ray to rule out anything else. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: One hundred and fifty dollars… and thirty dollars… oh dear. That's a lot of money. I don't know… I really don't want to spend that much if I don't have to. Maybe… maybe we could just try the medicine first? If it doesn't work, then we can think about the X-ray. I just want to be able to breathe again. I don't want to get sicker, but I don’t want to spend all our money either. What kind of medicine is it, Doctor? Will it make me sleepy? I need to help my husband with the animals, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. We can definitely start with the antibiotics and see how you respond. It's a common antibiotic called amoxicillin. It doesn’t usually cause significant drowsiness, but some people do experience mild fatigue. If you find it makes you sleepy, please let me know, and we can explore other options. I’m going to write you a prescription for a 10-day course. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. I'll also recommend some saline nasal rinses to help clear your sinuses and relieve congestion. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. Ten days… I can do ten days. And saline rinses… yes, that sounds good. Not too scary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me. I hope this medicine works. Will it help me sleep better too? My sinuses always bother me more at night. And… what if it doesn’t work? Will I have to get the X-ray then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad we came up with a plan you're comfortable with. The saline rinses can definitely help with nighttime congestion. As for the medicine helping you sleep, it shouldn't directly, but relieving the sinus pressure might make it easier to rest. If the antibiotics don’t improve your symptoms within a week, then yes, we'll need to get that X-ray just to rule out anything else going on. But let’s focus on getting you feeling better with the antibiotics first. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to use the saline rinses and some information about the medication, including potential side effects. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you again for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I hope I can come back and tell you it worked. .
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful! You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I truly hope you feel better soon. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. And yes, I look forward to hearing good news from you. Here's the prescription and the handout. Take care, and have a good day.
