DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I asked to come in for an HIV test. I just… I wanted to get tested. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. An HIV test. It’s… responsible of you to be proactive. And you’re 64, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Sixty-four this year. Is that… unusual? For someone my age to be thinking about this? I hope you don't mind me asking.
DOCTOR: Unusual isn’t the word I’d use. Uncommon, perhaps. Let’s just say most people your age haven’t… recently considered this possibility. But it’s good you are considering it. Now, have you had any… activities that would put you at risk?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a personal question, isn’t it? My husband and I… we’ve been married for a long time. But… things happen. I suppose I should be more specific. A few years ago, before my husband’s health really declined, we… experimented a little. It was a phase, really. And I haven’t… been with anyone else since then. Does that make sense? I apologize if that’s too much information.
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful information, Ms. Shaub. And perfectly alright. We need to be thorough. “Experimented.” Alright. And when you say a few years ago, roughly how many?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Let me see. It would have been… around seven years ago, perhaps? Eight? It was right before he started needing more care, so before 2017, definitely. It wasn't a long phase, thankfully. Just a few times. I just… I want to be sure. It’s been weighing on me.
DOCTOR: Seven or eight years. Alright. Now, have you had any symptoms that have prompted you to come in now, specifically?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all. That’s what’s so strange. I feel perfectly healthy, Doctor. Really. It’s just… I read something online, and it made me think. And I thought it best to be safe, rather than sorry. It's better to know, isn't it? Even if it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Online, of course. Alright. Well, feeling healthy doesn’t preclude anything, Ms. Shaub. We’ll proceed with the test. Now, before we do that, let’s go over some basic medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but that’s been controlled with medication for years now. And arthritis, of course, that’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. Nothing major, really. Oh, and a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. My husband… he had a lot more problems, but that’s beside the point. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, arthritis, pneumonia… alright. And what medications are you currently taking for these conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And for the arthritis, it’s Naproxen, 500 milligrams, twice a day when I need it. And sometimes, just Tylenol for the pain. That’s about it, Doctor. I try to keep it simple, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, Naproxen, Tylenol. Understandable. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite careful about what I take. A little bit of dust bothers my nose sometimes, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… irritation. I don’t think I have any true allergies, Doctor. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything dramatic like that.
DOCTOR: Right. No dramatic allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger. A very long time ago, probably thirty years or more. And I had a minor procedure on my knee a few years back, just a scope to clean things up, but that’s it, really. Nothing major. Is that all you need to know for now?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder, knee scope. Alright. And finally, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, but she lived to be eighty-five, so it wasn’t too bad. And my father had heart problems, but he… wasn’t very careful about his health. My siblings are all fairly healthy, as far as I know. Nothing… striking, really. Just the usual things, you know? High blood pressure, arthritis, that sort of thing. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Shaub, given your history, we will proceed with an HIV antibody test. It’s a simple blood draw. We’ll also run a basic CBC and a metabolic panel, just to get a baseline. While we wait for the results, I want to be frank with you. Given the timeframe you’ve mentioned, a single antibody test may not be conclusive. We may need to repeat it in a few weeks. And, frankly, your… lifestyle choices put you at a low but non-zero risk. Now, do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: A repeat test? Oh dear. That sounds… worrying. You mean it might not be accurate right away? And… “lifestyle choices”? I just… experimented, as I said. It was a long time ago. I'm a married woman, Doctor. I understand you have to ask these things, but it feels a bit… judgmental. But to answer your question… no, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Just… please hurry, if you can. I just want to know. It's been weighing on my mind for so long. And... what does a "low but non-zero risk" even mean? Is it very unlikely that I would… have something?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shaub, a single test can sometimes produce a false negative if it’s too soon after exposure. That’s why we repeat it. As for “low but non-zero risk,” it simply means that while your circumstances aren't typical for someone at high risk, there is still a possibility, however small. It’s responsible of you to be proactive, but it's also important to be realistic. Now, let’s get this blood draw done. It's a standard procedure. The nurse will be in shortly. And frankly, dwelling on it won't help. We'll have the results within a few business days.
PATIENT: .
