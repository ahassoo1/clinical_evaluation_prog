DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My regular doctor – Dr. Svenson, lovely woman – she just told me my cholesterol was a bit high after a checkup. Said I should come see someone about it, so here I am. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. High cholesterol, yes. Dr. Svenson is very thorough. It’s good you’re getting this checked out. It’s very common, and we can certainly discuss it. To start, can you tell me a little more about when Dr. Svenson told you this was high?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was just last month, I believe. June, yes, definitely June. During my yearly physical. She said something about numbers and needing to watch things, but I mostly just nodded and smiled. Numbers always go over my head, you know? I’m more of a people person. She gave me a paper, but… well, it’s probably at home. I’m not very good at keeping track of those things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. Many people find those numbers confusing. Don't worry about the paper for now. We can look them up in our system, if Dr. Svenson sent them over. Just to get a better picture, have you experienced any symptoms that Dr. Svenson mentioned might be related to high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I recall her mentioning any specific ones, and I haven’t felt anything different, really. I get a little tired sometimes, but at my age, isn’t that just… normal? I walk every morning, try to keep active, but I’m not as spry as I used to be. No chest pain or anything like that, thankfully. I eat pretty well, I think… mostly. My daughter tries to send me healthy things. She worries.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bohnett. No chest pain is certainly reassuring. And it's wonderful that you're staying active. Fatigue can be a symptom, but as you said, it's very common at your age. Let's talk a little about your overall health history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago now. No problems with that since. And my knees are a bit creaky, the doctor says it’s arthritis, but it's just old age, really. Nothing serious. Oh, and I had a bit of a scare with my heart a long time ago, but they put a stent in and I’ve been fine ever since. That was… oh, must be twenty years ago now, maybe more. I take a little pill for that, every day. Can’t remember the name of it, though. My daughter handles refilling it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a stent placed for a heart condition… Thank you, Mr. Bohnett. That’s helpful. And you said you take a pill for the heart condition, do you recall who prescribed that pill?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… that would have been Dr. Henderson, I believe. He was at the old City Hospital. A very nice man. He retired years ago, though. I’ve been seeing a cardiologist at Northside Hospital ever since, Dr. Ramirez. She just checks up on me every year or so to make sure everything’s still okay. I don’t see her unless she calls me in, really.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me just pull up your records from Northside Hospital… Ah, here we are. Dr. Ramirez. And I see you're on… clopidogrel. That’s the pill you mentioned. Good. Now, Mr. Bohnett, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her, “No, dear, I’m not allergic to anything.” I used to help her bake cookies when she was little, and we used all sorts of things. She’s a worrier, that one. Always checking if I’m safe. Bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Bohnett. And it sounds like you have a very caring daughter. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, you say? Well, I live alone now, my wife passed away ten years ago. I keep busy, though. I walk every morning, like I mentioned. And I volunteer at the senior center a couple of days a week, helping with bingo. I enjoy reading, mostly historical novels. And I watch the news, though it’s mostly depressing these days. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, just to relax. I used to be a carpenter, built houses for a living. It was good work, honest work. Now I mostly just… keep busy. Do you need to know anything else?
DOCTOR: That gives me a very good sense of things, Mr. Bohnett. Thank you for sharing. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven't felt anything wrong, but I suppose it’s always good to check. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bohnett. We’ll take it slow. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope… Deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which we already know about from Dr. Ramirez. Lungs are clear… Now, let’s just take a quick look at your extremities… Pulses are good in both legs and feet… And no swelling… Okay, one moment while I check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I'm just relaxing, Doctor. Do you think that blood pressure is bad? My daughter always worries about my blood pressure. She says I need to watch my salt intake. She's probably right, I do enjoy a good pickle now and then. And I like a bit of gravy with my roast chicken. Is gravy bad for your blood pressure? I just want to know if I need to start worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Everything sounds generally good, as you said. The murmur is consistent with what Dr. Ramirez has noted, and your reflexes are normal. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82, but it’s not critically high. Your daughter is right to be mindful of your salt intake. Excess salt can contribute to higher blood pressure. And gravy, unfortunately, is often quite high in salt. But it’s not about drastically restricting everything. It’s about moderation. We can discuss some dietary changes, but let’s not panic. Now, looking at your recent lab results from Dr. Svenson… Your cholesterol is indeed elevated. Your total cholesterol is 240, LDL is 160, and your HDL is 40. Those numbers do suggest we should address this to reduce your risk of heart disease.
PATIENT: 240… 160… those numbers don’t mean anything to me, Doctor. Are those bad numbers? Is that why Dr. Svenson sent me here? I just want to know if I need to be worried. I don’t want to end up in the hospital. My wife… she was in the hospital a lot at the end. I don’t want that. And what does "LDL" and "HDL" mean? Is one good and one bad? I’m getting confused with all these numbers and letters. I just want you to explain it to me like I’m… well, like I’m an old man who doesn’t understand all this fancy medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask, Mr. Bohnett. It is confusing, and it’s my job to explain it clearly. You are not alone in feeling overwhelmed by these numbers. Think of cholesterol like different types of fats in your blood. Your total cholesterol is 240, and ideally, we want that under 200. LDL is what we call "bad" cholesterol. It’s the type that can build up in your arteries and cause problems. Yours is 160, and we’d like to see that under 100. HDL is "good" cholesterol. It helps remove the bad cholesterol from your arteries. Yours is 40, which is a little on the lower side. We’d like to see that above 60, if possible. Dr. Svenson sent you here because your LDL is elevated, and that increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. But it’s not a crisis, Mr. Bohnett. We can manage this with lifestyle changes and, potentially, medication. We want to prevent you from ending up in the hospital, and that's entirely possible.
PATIENT: Okay… so LDL is bad, HDL is good, and mine are… not so good. And my blood pressure is a little high too. It sounds like I need to change my ways. What kind of changes are we talking about? Do I have to give up gravy completely? And what about the medication? I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. I already take one for my heart, and I don’t want to be on any more. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t I just… eat healthier and walk more? I’m willing to try, but I don’t want to be loaded up with pills. I just want to know what my options are.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Bohnett. And you’re right to be concerned about taking more medication. Let’s talk about your options. The first step is absolutely lifestyle changes. That's the most important thing. We can focus on a heart-healthy diet – reducing saturated and trans fats, limiting salt intake, and eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Reducing your gravy consumption would definitely be helpful, but you don't have to eliminate it completely. Moderation is key. Increasing your walking is also excellent. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Now, regarding medication… Your cholesterol is a little high, and your blood pressure is mildly elevated. We can try lifestyle changes for three to six months and see if we can get those numbers down. If we can't, or if they don't improve enough, we may need to consider medication to reduce your risk of a heart attack or stroke. The medication we would consider is a statin. It’s generally well-tolerated, but it does have potential side effects, like muscle aches. We would start with a low dose and monitor you closely. For now, let’s focus on the lifestyle changes. I can give you some resources on heart-healthy eating and exercise. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to check your numbers and see how you’re doing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Three months of trying to eat better and walk more. I can do that. I suppose. I’ll try my best. And if it doesn’t work, then we can talk about the pills. Muscle aches don’t sound very good. Resources on eating and exercise… that would be helpful. My daughter sends me things sometimes, but it’s mostly stuff about superfoods and complicated recipes. I just need something simple. Something an old man can understand. And… is there anything else I need to worry about? Anything I forgot to ask? I just want to make sure I’m covering everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question, Mr. Bohnett. It’s good to be thorough. This pamphlet has some simple guidelines for a heart-healthy diet, and I’ll also write down a few websites with reliable information. Beyond diet and exercise, it’s important to manage stress. Find healthy ways to relax, like spending time with loved ones, reading, or gardening. And, of course, continue taking your current medication for your heart condition as prescribed. As for anything you’ve forgotten… We’ve covered the major concerns. It’s important to be aware of the symptoms of a heart attack or stroke – chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking. If you experience any of those symptoms, call 911 immediately. We’ll check your numbers in three months. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve explained it very clearly, Doctor. Thank you for not making me feel like an idiot with all the numbers and letters. My daughter will be happy to hear I’m going to try to eat better. She’s always telling me to watch my health. I think I’ll just… head home and take a nap. All this talk about cholesterol has tired me out. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Get some rest, and remember, small changes can make a big difference. Have a good day. .
