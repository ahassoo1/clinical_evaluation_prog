DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need to… prepare some things, for the future. I was advised to inquire about a form, an… Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form, I think someone mentioned that as well. I don’t quite recall who, or precisely why I need it, but it felt… important.
DOCTOR: I see. Preparing for the future, you say. It’s… prudent to consider these things, certainly. Though, at 35, it’s not typically the first thing one thinks about. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both related to healthcare wishes, but they serve different purposes. Before we delve into forms, let’s clarify why you were advised to look into this. Could you tell me who suggested these forms, and what specifically prompted the recommendation?
PATIENT: That… is a very good question. It’s… frustratingly vague. I believe it was… a friend of a friend? Perhaps someone at the divorce proceedings? It was shortly after everything finalized, and there was… a lot of discussion about… arrangements. Financial, mostly. And then… someone mentioned needing to be prepared, just in case. I recall a feeling of… urgency, but the details… slip away. I truly apologize, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It feels like a dream, almost. Was it a lawyer? A financial advisor? I wish I could recall.
DOCTOR: It seems this was prompted by a rather stressful life event, and the advice was… ill-defined. That does explain the vagueness. While it's good you're thinking about this now, proceeding without a clear understanding of why you need these documents isn’t particularly helpful. Let’s approach this systematically. Before we discuss the forms themselves, let me ask a few questions to assess your current health status and overall concerns. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A systematic approach is preferable, I believe. I… don’t believe so. No chronic conditions, as far as I’m aware. I maintain a fairly… simple lifestyle. I work from home, mostly. Etching and engraving. It’s… solitary work, but it suits me. I haven’t had a serious illness… not in recent memory, at least. A few colds, perhaps, but nothing requiring ongoing treatment. I do have… some back discomfort, from bending over the worktable for extended periods, but I manage it with stretching and… rest. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Stretching and rest are good, but prolonged back discomfort warrants investigation. We'll address that later. For now, let's focus on your overall health. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing… major, certainly. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, I suppose. That was… routine, I think. But no other surgeries. I tend to avoid… medical interventions whenever possible. I prefer… natural remedies, when available. Though, I acknowledge the limitations of such approaches, of course. It’s… difficult to recall specific details, as you may have noticed. It wasn't a particularly traumatic event, if that is what you are asking, Doctor. Just a routine procedure.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal is hardly an intervention, Ms. Buoniconi. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not currently. I avoid them whenever possible. I occasionally take ibuprofen for the back discomfort, but it’s… infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. It’s over-the-counter, of course. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I prefer to manage things myself, as much as possible. It feels… empowering, somehow. Is that illogical, Doctor? I apologize for rambling. My mind feels… disorganized today.
DOCTOR: It’s not illogical to prefer self-management, Ms. Buoniconi, but it’s important to be transparent about all medications you are taking, even infrequent ones. Ibuprofen can have side effects, and it’s relevant to your overall health picture. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that is… difficult. My family… is rather distant. I grew up primarily with my grandmother, in Mongolia. We didn't discuss… medical conditions, not really. She was a very practical woman, focused on survival. She lived to a very old age, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses she suffered from. I believe my mother… had some issues with her heart, but I wasn’t close to her. She passed away when I was young. I honestly… don’t have much information. Is that… unhelpful, Doctor? I apologize for being so vague. It feels as if I am grasping at shadows.
DOCTOR: A lack of information is… less than ideal, Ms. Buoniconi. It makes a complete assessment rather difficult. However, we will proceed with what we have. Now, regarding your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. No, absolutely not. I do not smoke. I… rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but it’s… infrequent. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I find such things… detrimental to one’s well-being. I lead a very… quiet life, as I mentioned. I prefer to focus on my work, and maintain a… healthy lifestyle. Is that… satisfactory, Doctor? I hope I haven't offended you with my… frankness.
DOCTOR: It is… adequate, Ms. Buoniconi. Now, let’s address your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I am aware of. I don’t believe so. I have never experienced any… severe allergic reactions. Perhaps a mild sensitivity to certain fragrances, but nothing requiring medical attention. I can tolerate most foods, and I haven’t encountered any… environmental triggers. I suppose I am… fortunate in that regard. Is that unusual, Doctor? My grandmother always said I had a… robust constitution. I apologize if I am rambling again. My mind feels… rather scattered today.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconi, with all due respect, you are providing a remarkably… sparse medical history. While a lack of known allergies is fortunate, the overall picture is… incomplete. However, let’s proceed with a physical examination. It may reveal some underlying issues that you haven’t identified. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I apologize for the… lack of detail. I truly wish I could provide more information, but my memory… fails me. I will do my best to cooperate. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16 and unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. You mentioned some back discomfort. Can you pinpoint the exact location of the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, it's… right here. It’s a… dull ache, mostly. It radiates down my legs sometimes, but it’s… intermittent. It’s worse after I’ve been working for a long period, bending over the etching table. It feels as if… the muscles are strained. It’s not… debilitating, but it’s… persistent. It's been going on for… several months, I believe. It feels as if… it’s gradually worsening, but perhaps that's just my imagination. I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, and mild restriction in range of motion. No radicular symptoms noted with straight leg raise. It appears you have some degree of lumbar strain, likely exacerbated by prolonged bending. It doesn’t appear to be a serious condition at this time, but it warrants further investigation. We will need to order some imaging—an X-ray of the lumbar spine—to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. I will also prescribe a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture. However, Ms. Buoniconi, I am concerned about the overall lack of detail in your medical history. It is hindering my ability to provide you with the best possible care. I strongly recommend you consult with a specialist—a neurologist—to assess your memory and rule out any underlying neurological conditions.
PATIENT: An X-ray… and physical therapy. Very well, Doctor. I will… comply. A neurologist… you believe my… memory issues are concerning enough to warrant a specialist? I… hadn’t considered that. I simply assumed it was… a consequence of stress, and the… recent upheaval. Very well. If you believe it’s necessary, I will consult with a neurologist. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Though… I confess, I am rather apprehensive. Regarding the Advance Directive and POLST form… should we postpone discussing those, until we have a better understanding of my… overall health?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Buoniconi, postponing the discussion of those forms is… prudent. Addressing your potential memory issues is the priority. I will provide you with a referral to a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. They will conduct a thorough evaluation and determine the appropriate course of action. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to refrain from making any major life decisions until you have a clear understanding of your cognitive health. It is essential that you are of sound mind when considering such matters. I will also send the X-ray order to the radiology department, and provide you with a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to alleviate some of your back pain. Do you have any further questions for me, Ms. Buoniconi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… all. You have provided me with… much to consider. Thank you for your… patience. And your… candor. I will… schedule the appointments, and follow your recommendations. I apologize for… taking up your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please contact the clinic if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointments. Have a… good day, Ms. Buoniconi. .
