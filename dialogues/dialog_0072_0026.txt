DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something about being awfully tired, I suppose. Just awfully tired. And the young man at the lab kept talking about my… my what was it… creatine something? Sounded important, but honestly, I don’t pay much mind to all that lab talk. It’s just… tiring, all of it.
DOCTOR: "Creatine," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it. Creatine. It was a number, too. A high number, I think they said. Honestly, numbers all blur together after a while. I used to be able to keep track of things, you know. Being a diver, you have to. But… not so much anymore. It’s just… this tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, I can barely get out of my chair. It’s not like I’m doing much to get out of, these days. My Harold… well, he does most everything now.
DOCTOR: I see here your creatinine level is elevated. Now, creatinine is a waste product in your blood, filtered by your kidneys. An elevated level… well, it can indicate some issues with kidney function. Let’s not jump to conclusions, but we do need to investigate further. Now, you mentioned being a diver. How long have you been diving, and when did you last dive?
PATIENT: Oh, diving… a long time. Decades, I suppose. Started when I was a girl, practically. My father was a diver, and his father before him. It’s in the blood, you know? As for when I last… goodness, that’s a good question. It’s been a while. A long while. Harold would know. He keeps track of these things. Probably a year or more. I haven’t felt up to it lately, with the… you know. The tiredness. It’s not the same when you don’t have the energy. It's dangerous, really.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, a year or more of inactivity can certainly have an impact. Now, Ms. Oitker, besides the tiredness, have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, color, amount?
PATIENT: Urination? Goodness. I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. I mean, one goes when one needs to, doesn’t one? I suppose it’s… normal? I haven’t noticed anything different. Though… Harold did mention something about me getting up more at night. But he’s always fussing about something or other. Probably just old age, if you ask me. It's the natural order of things, isn't it? Everything wears out eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh… now that you mention it, my shoes have been a bit tight lately. I just figured my feet were getting wider with age. Harold said something about them looking puffy a few weeks ago, but I told him he was just being silly. He worries too much, that man. Always has. It’s probably just the heat, you know? It’s been awfully warm this summer. Makes everything swell.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, based on what you’ve told me – the elevated creatinine, the fatigue, the increased nighttime urination, and the swelling in your feet – it’s quite possible we’re dealing with a decline in kidney function. We need to run some additional tests to confirm this, of course. I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a urinalysis. I also want to check your blood pressure. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, I don't think so. I've taken a little of this and a little of that over the years. Nothing ever seemed to bother me. I used to take something for my… my arthritis, years ago. But I stopped taking that a long time ago. It didn’t seem to do much good anyway. Harold handles all my prescriptions now. He’s very careful, that man. Very careful indeed. I doubt I've ever had a serious reaction to anything. I’m a strong woman, you see. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, even if it’s just an occasional pain reliever?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Harold keeps a list, somewhere. He’s very organized. Hmm… He gives me something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly achy, he gives me something for the pain. It's a yellow capsule, I believe. He also makes me take a vitamin… a multivitamin, I think it is. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to all the pills. I just take what he gives me. He knows best, you see. He's a retired pharmacist. Very knowledgeable man.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s important that I have a complete and accurate list. We need to be certain these medications aren’t contributing to your symptoms, or interacting in a way that’s impacting your kidney function. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And, Ms. Oitker, if you could just try to recall the names of these medications, it would be most helpful. </stage>
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I suppose I could try. But don't expect much, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be. And lying down… it's not easy these days. Everything aches. But alright, alright. I’ll lie down. Just… give me a moment. Harold always helps me up and down. He's so strong. Now, about those pills… It's just all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some mild tenderness in the flank regions. No masses palpated. Ms. Oitker, these findings are concerning. While we await the lab results, I'm going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your kidneys. It’s vital that we determine the cause of your fatigue and elevated creatinine. I would also like you to start a 24-hour urine collection to get a more accurate assessment of your kidney function. I will have the nurse explain the procedure to you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All of that… an ultrasound and collecting urine for a whole day? It sounds… rather unpleasant. Is it serious, Doctor? Is something terribly wrong? I just want to feel normal again. I used to be so strong, you see. A diver, like my father and his father before me. Now… I just feel tired. And… collecting urine for a whole day… I don't know if I can do all of that. It sounds like a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your concerns. It is a lot, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. While I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis at this time, your symptoms and initial findings suggest a potential issue with your kidneys. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I will have the nurse explain the urine collection process in detail. It's not as unpleasant as it sounds, I assure you. She will provide you with a container and detailed instructions. I want to emphasize that delaying these tests could lead to further complications. I also recommend that you follow up with a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – for a comprehensive evaluation. I can provide a referral. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a nephrologist? Is that some kind of fancy doctor? Oh, goodness. This is all so overwhelming. I just came in because I was tired. Now I need a… a specialist and to collect urine for a whole day. I suppose… I suppose I should do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Harold always says you know best. But… I don't like all of this. It feels… scary. Will it hurt? Will I be sick? I just want to go home now.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your anxiety. It is a lot to take in. A nephrologist is a specialist who focuses on kidney health. They will be able to provide a more in-depth evaluation and determine the best course of treatment. The tests themselves are not typically painful. The urine collection may be a bit inconvenient, but it's a non-invasive procedure. As for feeling sick, that depends on the underlying cause of your symptoms. We won't know until we have the results of these tests. I'm going to order the blood work, the ultrasound, and the 24-hour urine collection. I will also prepare a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a nephrologist I trust. The nurse will provide you with all the necessary instructions and answer any questions you may have. For now, I recommend you maintain a low-sodium diet and drink plenty of fluids. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Do you have any immediate questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Low… low sodium? That means no salt? Oh dear. Harold loves his salt. He puts it on everything. This is going to be difficult. And drinking plenty of fluids… I suppose I can manage that. But all of this… it just feels… unfair. I used to be so independent. No, I don't think so. Not right now. I just want to go home and lie down. Thank you, Doctor. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Oitker. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk and provide you with the necessary instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you next week. .
