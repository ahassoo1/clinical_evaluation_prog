DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my sister, she... she got sick. Real sick. And my mother, she had some problems with her heart. So, I just... I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Just want some peace of mind. It’s been on my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It’s good you’re thinking about this. So, to get a better picture of things, let's start with you. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Not really. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot. Sales, you know? Always on the road. I eat okay, I guess. Not fancy food, just… normal things. No aches or pains, nothing like that. I don't think so, anyway. It's hard to say, maybe just getting old. I’m seventy-three now.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Schwer. It’s good you haven’t been experiencing any acute aches or pains. Feeling tired can have many causes, and your busy schedule certainly could contribute. When you say "normal things" with your diet, could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast, usually just coffee and maybe a piece of toast. Lunch is often something quick, like a sandwich when I’m traveling. Dinner... depends. Sometimes my daughter brings me something, sometimes I just have leftovers. I like noodles, rice... you know, Asian food sometimes. Not a lot of vegetables, I guess. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard when you're always moving. I drink a little beer sometimes with dinner. Not too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better idea. Coffee, toast, sandwiches, noodles, rice… occasional beer. It sounds like a fairly typical diet for a busy person. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… high what? I think the doctor, a long time ago, said my pressure was a little high. But I don't remember much about it. He gave me some pills, I took them for a while, then… I don’t know. It wasn't too bad. Diabetes? No, never. Cholesterol… what is cholesterol? I’m sorry, I’m not good with the medical words.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Schwer. That’s perfectly alright. Many people find medical terminology confusing. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when the force of your blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. And cholesterol is a waxy substance in your blood that can build up and cause problems. It’s good you recall taking pills for your blood pressure at some point. Do you remember when approximately that was, or who your doctor was at that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… a long time ago. Maybe… fifteen, twenty years ago? I moved around a lot for work, so I had different doctors everywhere. I don’t really remember the name of that one. He was in… Phoenix, I think. A big office. I saw him just a couple of times, then I went to another doctor when I moved again. I’m really bad with names and dates, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schwer. Don’t worry about it. It's understandable to forget details over time, especially with frequent moves. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… no, never had surgery. Hospital? Once. When I was young. Broke my arm when I was a kid, playing. But that was a long, long time ago. Just a broken arm, nothing serious. They put a cast on it and I was fine. That's all. I've been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Schwer. No surgeries and just a broken arm as a child – that is pretty lucky. Now, let’s talk about your family. You mentioned your sister and mother. Could you tell me a little more about their health issues?
PATIENT: Yes. My sister… she got sick last year. Real sick. It was… her heart, I think. They took her to the hospital a lot. She's… she's getting better now, but it was scary. And my mother… she had heart problems too, when she was older. She was tired all the time, and her legs swelled up. She passed away… maybe ten years ago? It was a long time ago, but I remember she was always at the doctor.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your sister and mother, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Heart problems in both your sister and mother are important information. Do you know if either of them had any specific diagnoses, like congestive heart failure or coronary artery disease?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t know those words. The doctors said something about… the valves? My mother, they said her valves weren’t working right. And my sister… they said she had a weak heart, and something about… fluid? She had a lot of fluid in her legs and she was very tired. I didn’t really understand everything the doctors said. It was all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Schwer. Medical language can be very complex. "Valves" refers to the parts of the heart that control the flow of blood, and "fluid" likely refers to swelling, or edema, which can be a sign of heart problems. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I never smoked. Never liked it. My wife, she smoked for a long time, but she stopped years ago. It's a bad habit. I always told her that. I drink a little beer sometimes, like I said, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No smoking history, just occasional beer. Now, are there any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean, I sneeze sometimes when the flowers bloom, but that’s it. Nothing serious. No food allergies, no medicine allergies… I don’t think so. I can take most medicines okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… um… sometimes I take aspirin for headaches. Just when I have a bad headache. And sometimes I take something for my stomach, like Pepto-Bismol. But that’s it. Nothing regularly. I don’t really like taking pills if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional aspirin for headaches and Pepto-Bismol as needed. That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Schwer, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see how things are looking. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to make sure I’m okay.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. Your pulse is 76 and regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Ears are clear. Nasal passages are normal. Throat is clear. Now I’ll palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses palpated. I’ll check your peripheral pulses and reflexes. Peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Now, I'm just going to check your weight. Your weight is 53 kilograms. Now, one final thing, I'd like to just listen to your back. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.
PATIENT: Okay. That was… a lot. Everything feels okay. I don’t feel any pain. Is something wrong? My blood pressure is high, you said? And a… murmur? What does that mean? My sister had a murmur, I think.
DOCTOR: It was a lot, yes, but you were very cooperative, Mr. Schwer. And no, it doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong. A slightly elevated blood pressure of 142/88 is something we should monitor, and a murmur is a sound heard during the heartbeat. Many murmurs are harmless, known as “innocent murmurs”, but it’s important to investigate further to rule out anything more serious. The fact that your sister had a murmur is also relevant information. To get a clearer picture of what's going on with your heart, I'd like to order a few tests. These include an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity, and an echocardiogram, or echo, which is an ultrasound of your heart that can show us its structure and function. We’ll also do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and other important markers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Okay. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. I just want to know if I’m going to be okay. I don’t want to end up like my sister. So, yes, do the tests. What do I need to do? Will it hurt? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly reasonable to want reassurance. These tests will help us determine if there's anything we need to address and ensure you stay healthy. The EKG is completely painless. We just attach some small electrodes to your chest, arms, and legs. The echo is also painless, although the technician will need to apply some gel to your chest and move a probe around to get the images. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw. We can schedule the EKG and blood draw for tomorrow morning, and the echo can be scheduled for next week. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend a heart-healthy diet – plenty of fruits, vegetables, and lean protein, and limiting your intake of salt, sugar, and saturated fats. Regular, moderate exercise is also beneficial, if you’re able. Do you have any questions about that, or about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. Tomorrow is fine. Fruits and vegetables… I’ll try. I don’t exercise much, but I can walk more. Can I still have my beer sometimes? Just a little one? And what if the tests show something is wrong? What happens then? I'm just a little worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be worried, Mr. Schwer. Regarding your beer, an occasional small beer is unlikely to be a problem. Moderate alcohol consumption – generally defined as one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men – is often considered acceptable, but it's best to discuss it further once we have the test results. If the tests do show something is wrong, it doesn't necessarily mean a serious problem. There are many different heart conditions, and many of them are very treatable. We will thoroughly discuss the results, explain your options, and develop a plan that’s right for you. This could involve medication, lifestyle changes, or, in some cases, a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist. I want to assure you that we will take things one step at a time. Let’s get the tests done first, and then we’ll go from there. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… try not to scare me, okay? I’m already a little nervous. I’ll come tomorrow for the tests. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I will do my best to keep you informed and avoid unnecessary worry. My goal is to help you stay healthy and provide the best possible care. You’re very welcome. I’ll see you tomorrow morning for the EKG and blood draw. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good rest of your day.
