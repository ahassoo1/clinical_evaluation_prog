DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been botherin’ me for a long while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Not much else, really. It’s just… persistent, you know? Hard to get rid of. I don’t… I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. A persistent cough. That can certainly be bothersome. You mentioned it's been going on for a "long while," and you're having trouble pinpointing when it started. That's alright; we'll try to get a better sense of it. To start, could you describe the cough itself a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… It’s not a… a hacking cough, not like when you’re sick with something. More of a… a tickle, and then it just… comes out. Dry. No… not much phlegm, if any. It happens mostly… well, I guess it happens all the time now. When I try to talk for too long, maybe. Or when I lie down. Does that… make sense? I’m not very good at explainin’ things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You’re explaining it very well. A dry, tickling cough that happens with talking or lying down… yes, that gives me a better picture. And you haven't noticed any fever, chills, or shortness of breath with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills… not really. Shortness of breath… well, I get a little winded when I walk up the stairs, but I always have. I figured that was just… old age again. I don’t think it’s gotten worse recently, but… hard to say, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Do you… do you need me to remember dates or somethin’? Because I’m tellin’ ya, it’s gone.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Pavlovic, dates aren’t crucial. We can work around that. It's good to know the shortness of breath hasn’t worsened recently. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… That’s a good question. I… I think the doctor back in… well, it was a long time ago, back when I still lived in the city… he said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high. But I don’t remember takin’ any pills for it. And… my wife, bless her soul, she always took care of those things. I just… did the work. I don’t think I’ve ever had asthma or heart problems. I used to be pretty strong, workin’ on cars all day. But that was a long time ago. I’m sorry, I'm probably not bein’ much help.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Pavlovic. It's good to know about the past blood pressure issue, even if you don’t recall specific medications. And no history of asthma or heart problems is useful information. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I broke my arm once, when I was a young man. Fallin’ off a roof. They set it, I think. Didn’t need much more than that. Hospitalized… not really. Not that I remember. Maybe for the arm, but it was a long time ago, and I was mostly just sleepin’. My wife always handled the doctors and paperwork, you see. She was a very organized woman. I… I miss her. Sorry. Getting off track. No major hospital stays, as far as I recall. Just the arm. A long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s perfectly natural to reminisce. And thank you for letting me know about the broken arm. Now, regarding your family… do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. That's a tough one. My wife… she had some trouble with her stomach when she got older. But I don't know what kind. And my parents… they passed away a long time ago. I don’t remember them bein’ sick with much of anything. We didn’t see them very often, even when we lived closer. I had a brother, but… he moved away when we were young. I haven’t spoken to him in… well, a very long time. I don’t know what happened to him. Sorry, I’m not much help with family history. It’s all… a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s common for family medical history to be difficult to recall. Let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never liked it. My wife didn’t like it either. Always told me it was bad for my health. And she was right about a lot of things. I used to be around it sometimes, workin’ on cars, folks smokin’ in the shop… but I never took it up myself. Always avoided it. No, never smoked a day in my life. Always preferred fresh air. Even now, when I’m sittin’ inside, I like to have a window open.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, Mr. Pavlovic. And good for you for avoiding smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. Mostly on weekends. Nothing fancy, just a little somethin’ to relax. But… not so much anymore. Not since my wife passed away. Didn't seem right drinkin’ without her. Maybe a sip on special occasions, but that’s about it. It's been a long time since I had a full beer. Wouldn't say I drink regularly, not at all. Mostly just water these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. And that's perfectly alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. No, not really. Like I said, my wife used to handle all that. I think I used to take somethin' for my blood pressure, but I stopped a long time ago. I don’t remember the doctor tellin' me to stop, but I just… stopped takin’ them. Maybe I should’ve asked, but… I didn't want to bother her. She was always so busy. No, I don't take any medications regularly now. Just water, mostly. And maybe a little ibuprofen for my aches and pains sometimes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be causing your cough. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm used to folks lookin' at me. Workin’ on cars, folks always lookin' over my shoulder. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable. My bones ain’t what they used to be, you know. But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little high today, 145 over 90. We can discuss that later. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a very faint murmur. This isn’t necessarily concerning, but we’ll keep it in mind. Now, listening to your lungs, I hear some mild crackling sounds at the bottom of both lungs. Your throat looks clear, no significant redness or swelling. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Thank you for your patience. The examination findings suggest some possible congestion in your lungs and slightly elevated blood pressure. The murmur is something we may need to investigate further with an EKG. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. My wife always asked me that before givin’ me anything. Never had a reaction to anythin’. We didn’t eat much fancy food, mostly just… simple things. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Never been stung by a bee, never had any problems with pollen… not that I remember. No allergies, Doctor. Just an old man with a cough. But thank you for askin’. It’s good to be careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Pavlovic. No known allergies is helpful. Based on what you've told me and the examination findings, it's likely your cough is related to some underlying lung congestion, possibly due to age-related changes or a mild respiratory issue. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will help us see if there’s any fluid or inflammation in your lungs, and the EKG will assess your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray and… EKG? Sounds… serious. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I just… don’t want to be a bother. I know you got other patients to see. But yes, if you think it’s best, go ahead. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. My bones get achy when I’m waitin’ around too long. But yes, do what you need to do. I want to get this cough taken care of. It’s just… wearin’ me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. It doesn’t sound serious, but these tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on and allow me to provide you with the best possible care. It's a precaution, nothing more. I'll have the nurse schedule you for a chest X-ray and an EKG. They’ll be able to tell you about the timing and location. It shouldn’t take too long, and we’ll make sure you’re comfortable. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It's over-the-counter, so it shouldn’t interact with anything you're currently taking. I’ll also recommend you increase your fluid intake and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. A cough suppressant and more fluids… sounds sensible. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. I appreciate it. My wife always said I was a bad patient, always complainin’ but never followin’ instructions. I’ll try my best to do what you say this time. But… one thing. Will the tests… will they hurt? I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand your apprehension. The tests are very straightforward and shouldn't be painful at all. The chest X-ray involves standing in front of a machine for a few seconds while it takes a picture of your lungs. You won’t feel anything. The EKG involves placing a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to monitor your heart rhythm. You won’t feel any sensation from those either. It’s all non-invasive and quick. I’ll make sure the technicians know you’re a bit anxious, and they'll explain everything to you step-by-step. Here’s the prescription for the cough suppressant. Please let the nurse know if you have any trouble filling it. And once the test results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. I’ll… I’ll try my best to get the tests done and follow your instructions. Just… just let me know when the results are in. I trust your judgment. I suppose I’ll be seein’ you again soon. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, take care of yourself and get some rest. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
