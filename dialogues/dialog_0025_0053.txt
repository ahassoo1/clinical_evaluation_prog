DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’ve been having trouble… going. It just takes me a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I can get it all out, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, maybe a month.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, you say. Okay. And when you say it takes a long time… can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Well, usually, it doesn’t take this long. It feels like I’m pushing… and pushing… for a good few minutes, sometimes five or even ten. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and tiring. And like I said, it doesn’t always feel like I empty my bladder completely. I have to go back again fairly soon after, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, straining, prolonged emptying, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. And this is new, within the last month?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. New. Definitely new. I haven't had trouble like this before. Not ever, really. Though, now that I think of it… maybe a little bit when I was a young woman, after having children, but it went away quickly. This feels… different. And it’s happening all the time now, not just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the difficulty with urination, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I’ve been drinking more water than usual, trying to help with the…problem, I suppose. And getting up at night more often to go to the bathroom. Maybe two or three times a night. I usually sleep right through, you know? And… no, that's about it. No pain, no fever, nothing like that. Just the waterworks and the extra trips at night.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a bit low. And that’s it, really. Just those two. Oh! And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've been pretty lucky that way, actually. I’ve had all my vaccinations, of course, and haven’t had any trouble with those either. My mother, she was allergic to penicillin, but I don’t think I've ever taken that.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides arthritis and the low vitamin D?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was in my forties. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they said it was just a flutter, nothing serious. They put me on the Lisinopril after that, to keep my blood pressure down. Aside from that… no, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy for my age, I think. I try to stay active, you know? Walking and gardening mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anyone in your family had any medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. And my sister, she had high blood pressure, like me. Nothing too serious on my other side of the family, as far as I know. They mostly lived long lives, even with a few aches and pains. I don’t think anyone had problems with their… waterworks, though. Not that I remember, anyway. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked for a while, but I always told him to do it outside! I always thought it was a terrible habit. I don’t even like being around it, if I’m honest. Makes me cough something awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much alcohol do you drink?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion. I don’t drink every day, not even close. A couple of times a month, perhaps. I prefer a nice cup of tea, really. Much better for you, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh… well, no. Not anymore. My husband passed away five years ago, and… I haven’t been with anyone since. I’m getting a bit old for all that, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with checking your abdomen and then I'll do a quick neurological exam, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. It’s a bit of a climb, but I’ll manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Lie back comfortably. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Okay, and I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Alright, everything seems normal so far. No tenderness, reflexes are intact. Now, I'm going to need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and just try to collect at least a couple of ounces. There’s a restroom just down the hall. Do you have any trouble getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage. A couple of ounces, you said? Yes, I can do that. It might take me a minute, but I’ll get there. I'm used to waiting, you know? Do I need to… clean anything first? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: No, just a normal sample will do. There are wipes in the restroom if you’d like to use them, but it’s not necessary. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, thank you. Let’s get this sent to the lab. We’ll have the results back within a day or two. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention, which means your bladder isn’t emptying completely. It could be a number of things, from a weak bladder muscle to a blockage. However, it's also common in women your age. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection first. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to check for infection. We’ll also need to check your post-void residual volume, which means we’ll measure how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A sensible plan, Doctor. Checking for infection and seeing how much is left behind. Yes, that's good. How do you… measure that? The leftover part? Do you have to… put something inside? I don’t like the sound of putting things inside.
DOCTOR: It's a simple test, Ms. Yadao. We use a small, sterile catheter – a very thin tube – to drain the remaining urine after you urinate. It’s a bit uncomfortable, yes, but it's very quick. It’s the most accurate way to determine how much urine is left behind. Alternatively, we can do a bladder scan, which uses ultrasound, but it’s not always as accurate, especially if you have a lot of bowel gas. I would recommend the catheter, just to be thorough. It will give us a clear picture of what's going on. If the results come back normal, we can discuss other options, such as bladder training exercises or medication. But let’s start with this test first, alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A tube… inside. I haven’t had one of those in a very long time. Well… alright. If you think it’s best, Doctor, I suppose I trust your judgement. It’s just… not pleasant. But if it will tell us what’s going on, then… yes. Let’s get it over with. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me when it’s done. I’m a bit nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I will be as gentle as possible. It will be a bit uncomfortable, but it should only take a few seconds. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll let you know exactly when we're finished. I’ll have a nurse assist me, just to make sure everything goes smoothly. We'll position you comfortably on your back, clean the area, and then gently insert the catheter. It’s important to relax your muscles, which will make it easier. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Relax, you said? That’s the hard part, isn’t it? But alright. Let’s just… get it over with. The sooner it's done, the better. And thank you, Doctor. For being so… patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I understand your apprehension. And you're very welcome. We'll take it slowly, and I'll let you know every step of the way. I'll call the nurse now. Just breathe deeply, and try to relax your muscles. Nurse, could you please come in and assist me with a catheter insertion for Ms. Yadao?
