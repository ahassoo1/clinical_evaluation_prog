DOCTOR: Hello Candis, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. I’m tired. Really tired. And I...well, it's embarrassing, but I've been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, just…a little bit when I'm feeling particularly weak. It started a few months ago, and it's getting worse. I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: A few months ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, around…April, I think. Maybe the beginning of May. It's hard to keep track, truthfully. Everything just feels…blurry these days. And it’s not like I’m shoveling it down, you understand. It’s more like…a craving. I find myself picking at the soil in my garden. It's awful. Don't even ask me why.
DOCTOR: Okay, a craving that started around April or May. And you mentioned feeling blurry…is that memory issues, or do you mean vision problems?
PATIENT: Oh, both, actually. My memory isn’t what it used to be, clearly. I forget things… important things. And my eyesight…well, it’s getting a bit dim. Everything seems washed out. It’s probably just old age, though. I don’t expect miracles.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod slowly, making another note. "Okay, memory issues and changes in vision. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Besides the tiredness, the dirt-eating, and those symptoms, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I suppose my appetite has been off. Not much interest in food these days, even the things I used to enjoy. And I’ve been… well, a bit short-tempered, I suppose. My neighbors are always complaining. Honestly, they're probably just looking for an excuse to bother me. But yes, I’d say I get irritated easily. It’s probably the tiredness, though. It makes anyone cranky.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and increased irritability. Those can definitely be connected to feeling tired. Have you had any trouble sleeping, Candis?
PATIENT: Sleeping? It's a nightmare, honestly. I toss and turn all night. I fall asleep eventually, but it's never a restful sleep. I wake up feeling just as exhausted as when I went to bed. It’s been…years, really. I just assumed it was part of getting old. What’s the point of asking me all these questions anyway? Are you trying to tell me I’m just old?
DOCTOR: Oh, Candis, absolutely not! I’m asking because all of these things – the tiredness, the appetite, the sleep, even the craving for dirt – they could all be connected. It’s my job to figure out how. And it’s important to rule things out. We just want to understand what’s going on with your body. Now, about that sleep…is it difficult to fall asleep, or difficult to stay asleep?
PATIENT: Both! It takes me ages to drift off, and then I'm waking up every hour or so. It's just…fidgety. And sometimes I have these strange dreams. Not nightmares, exactly, just…odd. I don’t remember much of them, but I wake up feeling uneasy. Honestly, it’s a bother. I just want a good night’s sleep, is that too much to ask? And frankly, I have better things to do than sit here answering questions all day.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod sympathetically. “No, it’s not too much to ask at all, and I understand your frustration. Let’s shift gears for a moment. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to talk about that? Really? Look, I’m an older woman. These things happen. What does my…bathroom schedule have to do with eating dirt and being tired? It’s probably nothing. A little constipation, that’s all. Not a big deal. Can we please get this over with? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand it feels personal, Candis, but changes in bowel habits can sometimes be connected to what’s going on. It helps us paint a full picture. Just a quick yes or no - have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No. Definitely not. And frankly, I’m not going to discuss this any further. I’ve answered your questions, now can we talk about what’s wrong with me? I'm tired, I'm eating dirt, and I can't sleep. What is causing this? I don't need to talk about my…digestive system. .
DOCTOR: Would that be alright?
