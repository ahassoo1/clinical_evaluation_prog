DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Nooruddin, is it? Yes, quite right. A pleasure to meet you. Well, to be perfectly frank, it’s about a rather… ill-advised dietary experiment I’ve recently undertaken. I’m beginning to suspect it wasn't the best idea. It’s all a bit silly, really, for a man of my age, but… here we are.
DOCTOR: An experiment, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. Though “experiment” perhaps elevates it too much. It was more of a… following a trend, shall we say? A rather restrictive one, I must admit. My… former wife’s new partner – a terribly enthusiastic young man – is quite the proponent of this “Air Diet”, as he calls it. Only consuming things that are… aerated. It sounded utterly ludicrous, but he swore by it. And, well, I’m a rather gullible old fool, I suppose.
DOCTOR: The… Air Diet. Right. And how long have you been on this… diet, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it hasn’t been terribly long, thankfully. Just shy of two weeks now. Though the last three days have been… particularly challenging. One simply can’t subsist on sparkling water and meringue, Doctor. It’s an affront to good taste, and evidently, good health. I'm finding my energy levels rather depleted, and I had a rather alarming bout of dizziness yesterday while attempting to prune the roses. A most undignified spectacle, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me consider… Yes, my sleep has been… fragmented. I wake rather frequently, often with a peculiar feeling of… emptiness. Not precisely hunger, mind you, but a sort of… lightness, if that makes any sense. And my digestion, well, it’s become… remarkably inactive. One feels rather… hollow, overall. Also, my wife—my former wife, I should clarify—pointed out I’m looking rather… grey. Which, admittedly, is not a new development, but she insists it’s become more pronounced. She has a rather keen eye for these things, despite everything.
DOCTOR: And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. A small selection, I'm afraid, accumulated over the years. I take a low dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, which has been stable enough, and a modest amount of Atorvastatin for cholesterol. And, rather embarrassingly, a mild sleeping aid – Temazepam – on occasion, though I've been trying to reduce my reliance on that, as you might imagine, given the current… predicament with my sleep patterns. Nothing else, I assure you. Just the standard assortment for a gentleman of my advancing years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully none that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most things, though I’ve never been particularly fond of oysters. Not an allergy, precisely, just a strong dislike. A textural issue, I suspect. They remind me of… well, never mind. The point is, no known allergies to anything that would complicate matters. A rather unremarkable medical history, all things considered, except for this… Air Diet folly, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Before we proceed, I need to be very clear: this diet is… highly unusual and demonstrably unhealthy. It's severely lacking in essential nutrients and quite frankly, putting your health at risk. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam to assess the situation. Can I get you to step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Perfectly sensible, Doctor. I fully concur. It was a most ill-conceived notion, and I am quite relieved to hear you confirm my suspicions. I was hoping for a firm, authoritative dismissal, to be honest. Yes, by all means, the scale. Consider it an act of contrition, if you will. A rather public admission of foolishness, but one I am willing to undertake.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your height is 187 centimeters, and your weight is 148 pounds, giving you a BMI of… 21.2. Blood pressure is 138 over 82 – slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds overall. Let's check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Very good. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. Diminished breath sounds… likely a consequence of general weakness, I presume? I haven't been taking my usual brisk walks lately, regrettably, preoccupied as I was with this… airy existence. Yes, do proceed with the reflexes. I'll cooperate fully. I've always found medical examinations… rather fascinating, though I confess to a slight trepidation whenever anything involving a hammer is produced.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a little sluggish, but present. Good. Now, I'd like to take a look in your ears and throat. Just to rule out anything obvious. Ears look normal. Throat is a little dry, but no signs of infection. Overall, the physical exam is consistent with general dehydration and mild weakness, likely secondary to inadequate nutrition. Which, frankly, is exactly what I expected given your… dietary choices.
PATIENT: Ah, that’s… reassuring, in a rather disheartening way. Confirmed by a professional, as it were. Dehydration and weakness… a far cry from the vibrant health I was promised by my young friend and his… airy regime. Well, I suppose I had it coming. Perhaps I’ve become too trusting in my old age. Is there any immediate cause for concern, Doctor? Any indication of lasting damage, or shall a more conventional diet remedy the situation? I am rather fond of a good roast chicken, you see, and am eager to resume such pleasures.
DOCTOR: No, there's no immediate cause for concern. We've caught this early enough to prevent any lasting damage. However, prolonged restriction like this can lead to serious complications – muscle loss, weakened immune system, even heart problems. We need to get you back on a balanced diet immediately. I recommend starting with small, easily digestible meals – soup, yogurt, fruit. Gradually reintroduce more complex foods over the next few days. Plenty of fluids are essential. And please, no more "Air Diet." I'm going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to get a baseline and rule out any deficiencies. We'll review the results next week. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Perfectly agreeable, Doctor. Soup, yogurt, fruit… a most sensible prescription. I shall abandon the airy existence forthwith and embrace the solid comforts of conventional sustenance. And the bloodwork sounds prudent – a comprehensive assessment is always welcome. You have my solemn promise, no further flirtations with restrictive diets of any kind. I am, quite frankly, relieved to have your professional intervention. I suspect my wife will be particularly pleased to hear this – she’s been rather vocal in her disapproval of my… experiment. Would you happen to have any recommendations for a particularly good brand of soup, Doctor? A silly question, perhaps, but one cannot be too cautious when embarking on a dietary rehabilitation.
DOCTOR: It is a good question, actually. I recommend something simple, like a good quality chicken noodle or vegetable broth. Avoid anything too high in sodium. And I can provide a referral to a registered dietician, if you’d like?
PATIENT: That is exceedingly kind of you, Doctor. A referral to a registered dietician sounds… positively sensible. A professional guide to navigate the complexities of solid nourishment would be most welcome. And chicken noodle soup it is. A classic for a reason, I presume. Are there any specific symptoms I should be mindful of in the coming days? Any indication that I should seek immediate attention? I am, naturally, eager to avoid any further… complications.
DOCTOR: Yes. Be mindful of dizziness, fatigue, or any muscle weakness. If you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or any irregular heartbeat, seek immediate medical attention. Also, if you have difficulty swallowing, or if you notice any changes in your mental state, contact me right away. Otherwise, small meals, plenty of fluids, and a gradual return to a normal diet should do the trick. We’ll review the bloodwork next week and adjust your plan accordingly. Here’s a referral to a dietician and the requisition for the bloodwork. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Excellent. That is all very clear, Doctor. Dizziness, fatigue, chest pain… a sensible checklist to bear in mind. And I shall endeavor to remain vigilant. No, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. I am exceedingly grateful for your patience and professionalism, Doctor Nooruddin. You’ve successfully dissuaded me from a most foolish undertaking, and restored my faith in the virtues of solid sustenance. Perhaps I shall treat myself to a particularly robust roast chicken this evening, as a celebratory gesture. Thank you again for your time and guidance. I look forward to seeing you next week.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I'm glad I could help. And enjoy your roast chicken – responsibly, of course. I’ll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
