DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Rosanova. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. I am here because… well, it is a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have a lot of… gas. Much more than usual, you understand? It is causing me some discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jammal, no need to be embarrassed at all. It's very common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. “Discomfort” is good to know – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. It is not… pain, exactly. More like… fullness. And pressure. Like a balloon, perhaps. Especially after I eat. It makes me feel… bloated. And, of course, the… passing of the gas is frequent. It is… disruptive. I worry sometimes when I am… out and about.
DOCTOR: Alright, fullness and pressure, especially after eating, and frequent gas… disruptive is a good way to put it. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began, I believe, around… late spring. Perhaps May? It was not so bad at first. Just a little more than usual. But it has… increased steadily since then. Now it is… quite noticeable. I remember specifically noticing it after I had some… cabbage. But it happens even when I do not eat cabbage.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around May, gradual increase, and you've noticed it with cabbage, but it’s not just cabbage. And you said it's more than usual for you – would you say this is a significant change, or just a slight uptick?
PATIENT: Significant, Doctor. Very significant. Before, it was… normal. Like anyone, you understand? A little gas after beans, perhaps. But now it is… almost constant. And much more… forceful, shall we say? It interferes with my… daily life. I find myself needing to be near a restroom frequently. It is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, "almost constant" and "forceful" – that gives me a better picture. And the restroom issue is definitely something we want to address. Let's talk about what you’ve been eating generally. Can you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Usually, for breakfast, I have… toast. With a little jam. And sometimes, a cup of tea. For lunch… often a sandwich. Ham and cheese, usually. Or… a simple salad. Nothing fancy. And for dinner… it varies. Sometimes I cook. Chicken, perhaps, with potatoes. Or… I get something from the shop. A pre-made meal. They have… many options. Pasta, rice… things like that. I do not eat a great deal of fruit, if that is of importance.
DOCTOR: Okay, toast, sandwiches, salads, chicken and potatoes, pre-made meals… not a lot of fruit. That’s helpful. Do you notice any specific types of pre-made meals that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Yes, that is a good question, Doctor. I believe the… Italian ones. The pasta dishes with tomato sauce. And the ones with… beans. Those are the worst offenders, I think. The chicken ones do not bother me as much. And the rice dishes are… tolerable. But the tomato sauce and beans… those create a great deal of… trouble. It begins soon after I eat them. Perhaps within an hour.
DOCTOR: Okay, Italian dishes with tomato sauce and beans are the biggest triggers. And within an hour. That's good to know. Do you have any issues with lactose?
PATIENT: Lactose? I do not believe so. I drink… milk sometimes in my tea. And I eat… cheese. I have never had any… difficulties with those things. No stomach upset. No… unpleasantness. I do not avoid dairy products.
DOCTOR: Okay, no issues with dairy. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the gas – things like bloating, changes in your bowel movements, any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. There is some… bloating, yes, as I mentioned before. And sometimes, a little… fullness. But not pain, exactly. My… bowel movements are generally normal. Regular, you understand? Nothing… unusual. No changes in that regard. And no nausea, no vomiting, no heartburn. I have not lost any weight. If anything, I may have… gained a little, but that is probably due to… inactivity. I do not exercise much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bloating and fullness are present, bowel movements are normal, and no other significant symptoms. And no weight loss. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: I do not, Doctor. I have… Medicare, of course, so I see the doctor regularly for check-ups. But I have never been diagnosed with anything serious. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, you understand. I had my… appendix removed when I was young, but that was many years ago. Otherwise, I am generally… healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in the past, otherwise generally healthy. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I occasionally take a… pain reliever for my… arthritis, but that is all. Just a small dose, when needed. And I do not take any… supplements. I prefer to avoid them, if possible. I believe in… natural remedies, when available. But for my… gas, I have not found any effective ones yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional pain reliever for arthritis, no regular medications or supplements. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I am ready when you are. I trust your… expertise. I am not… afraid, you understand. Just hoping for a… solution to my… problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening now. I don’t hear anything concerning – no unusual sounds. And when I press, you do seem a little tender in the lower abdomen, but nothing acutely painful. I also notice some mild distension – your abdomen feels a bit… full. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to get a baseline. Okay, everything sounds normal there as well. It sounds like we're dealing with a pretty typical case of excessive gas. It's unlikely anything serious is going on, but let's talk about some possible causes and what we can do about it. Do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no known allergies. I eat… most things. I have never had a… reaction to any food, to my knowledge. And as I said, I do not take any medications. I am a… fairly simple person, you understand. Not prone to… sensitivities. I am glad to hear it does not sound… serious. Perhaps it is simply something I am… eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies. That simplifies things. It's likely related to diet, as you suspect. The Italian dishes and beans are prime culprits, given your description. Sometimes, certain carbohydrates – what we call FODMAPs – can be poorly absorbed in the gut and cause gas. Those are found in a lot of different foods, but some of the ones you’ve mentioned are high in them. Here's what I recommend. We can try a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks to see if that helps. It involves temporarily reducing or eliminating certain foods, then slowly reintroducing them to see which ones are causing the problem. I can give you a list of foods to avoid and a sample meal plan. We can also try an over-the-counter simethicone product, like Gas-X, to help relieve the gas. It doesn't prevent it, but it can make it more comfortable. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very… reasonable. A low-FODMAP diet… I can certainly attempt that. And the Gas-X… if it can relieve some of the discomfort, I would be most grateful. Could you please provide me with the list of foods to avoid, and the sample meal plan? I am eager to… begin, and hopefully find some relief. Thank you for your… assistance. It is a great comfort to have a… plan of action.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jammal. Here you go. This list is quite detailed, but the main things to focus on initially are avoiding things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, stone fruits, dairy products, wheat and rye, beans and lentils, and high-fructose corn syrup. The meal plan gives you some ideas for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It may seem restrictive at first, but it's only temporary. I also recommend starting with a low dose of simethicone—usually 250mg after meals as needed. I’d like to see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing. If your symptoms haven’t improved after that, or if they get worse, we may need to consider further testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… excellent. I will carefully review this list, and attempt to follow the meal plan as closely as possible. And I will try the simethicone. Two weeks is… acceptable. I will make an appointment for a follow-up visit. Thank you once again for your… kindness and guidance. I feel much more… optimistic now. Hopefully, this will… resolve the issue. Is there anything else I should… be aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jammal. I'm glad you're feeling more optimistic. The most important thing is to be patient and consistent with the diet. One other thing: staying hydrated is important. Drink plenty of water throughout the day. And try to avoid carbonated beverages, as they can contribute to gas. If you experience any concerning symptoms—like severe abdominal pain, blood in your stool, weight loss, or persistent vomiting—please call the office immediately. Otherwise, just focus on the diet, stay hydrated, and we'll see how you're doing in two weeks. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been most… thorough and helpful. I will follow your instructions carefully, and schedule my follow-up appointment. Thank you again for your… time and expertise. I am very… grateful. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jammal. I'm happy to help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
