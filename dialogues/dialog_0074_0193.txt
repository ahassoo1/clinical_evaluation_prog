DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Reisig. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing gas. A lot. More than usual. It’s been happening for, oh, I would say, maybe two weeks now. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it is… disruptive. And a little smelly, if I am being truthful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite bothersome when something like that changes, even if it isn’t painful. It's good you're addressing it. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Hmm… well, it seems to happen mostly after I eat. Any kind of food, really. Not immediately after, though. Usually a few hours later. And it doesn't seem to matter where I eat, either – at home, at the restaurant where I work… everywhere is the same. Sometimes it is just a little rumble, other times… well, more substantial. I haven’t changed my diet recently, not that I know of. I eat about the same things I always have.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s happening a few hours after eating, regardless of location, and doesn't seem tied to any specific foods or dietary changes. That's helpful. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the increased gas?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No stomach pain, no… changes in how I go to the bathroom. No heartburn or anything like that. Just… the gas. And sometimes a little… bloating, maybe? Not always, but occasionally I feel a bit full, even if I haven't eaten much. It goes away after a bit. I don’t feel sick, and I have been sleeping alright. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all helpful information, Mr. Goodstein. The lack of other symptoms is good. Bloating is also relevant. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so I am not as young as I once was! But no, I don't have any… serious conditions. The doctor at my old clinic checked me over a few years back, and everything was fine then. I take a vitamin D supplement, just because the doctor recommended it. And sometimes I take something for my allergies, but only during pollen season. Otherwise, I am generally quite healthy, I believe. I try to walk when I can, but my job keeps me on my feet enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no diagnosed medical conditions, vitamin D supplement, and allergy medication as needed. That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, anyway. When I was a little boy, I had my tonsils taken out, but that was… a very long time ago. Besides that, nothing. Just the usual bumps and bruises from working, I suppose. Does that matter? It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know, Mr. Goodstein. Even things from a long time ago can sometimes be relevant. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her stomach, I think. Indigestion, mostly. She always complained about feeling bloated after eating. My father was generally quite healthy, I think. He lived a long life. And my sister… she has high blood pressure, I believe, but that’s about it. Nothing major, as far as I know. We don’t talk very often, so I am not always sure. It’s not a very interesting family history, I’m afraid. Mostly just… normal old age problems.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. It’s helpful to have some idea. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Never will. It is very bad for you, you know. My mother always warned me about it. And I can't stand the smell. No, I do not smoke. Not even a little bit.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Just one. Red wine, usually. It’s… relaxing, you know? But I don’t drink every day. Maybe a few times a week, if that. Never anything strong. Just a small glass. I hope that's alright. It’s not a habit, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. Just a glass of wine occasionally isn’t a concern. Now, one last question about your social history. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Oh! I work at a fast-food restaurant. Counter work, mostly. Taking orders, making sandwiches, cleaning up. It keeps me on my feet all day, which is… good for me, I suppose. It is a bit stressful sometimes, though. Especially during the lunch rush. Lots of people, lots of noise. But it’s a job. And it pays the bills. Nothing glamorous, but it is honest work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little bit… active, perhaps. No signs of anything acutely concerning. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I have taken allergy medicine before, when the pollen is bad, and I have never had a reaction. The doctor at my old clinic gave me something, a few years back. It worked fine. No itching, no swelling, nothing like that. I’m generally quite tolerant, I believe. I don’t usually get sick, even when others around me do. You can probably give me just about anything, I think. But it's always good to ask, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the vitamin D supplement and the occasional allergy medicine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the vitamin D, and the allergy pills when the pollen is high. That is all. I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy on my own, you see. A good diet, some walking… that’s usually enough. I don’t want to become dependent on medication, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Goodstein. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing increased gas, possibly related to dietary factors, or just a change in your gut microbiome. While not alarming, it is bothersome, and we should try to find a solution. I'm going to recommend a few things. First, let's try keeping a food diary for a week or so, noting everything you eat and drink, and when you experience the gas. This might help us identify any triggers. Second, I’d like you to try over-the-counter simethicone, which can help reduce gas and bloating. The dosage instructions will be on the package. Finally, I recommend staying well-hydrated. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very reasonable. A food diary… I can do that. It might be a bit of a bother, but if it helps, I am willing to try. And the simethicone… I think I have heard of that. I will read the instructions carefully. Staying hydrated… yes, I should probably do that more. You are very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It is embarrassing to talk about, but you make me feel much better. So, a food diary, simethicone, and more water. I can do that. What if it doesn’t help?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Goodstein. If these measures don’t provide relief after a week or two, we can consider other possibilities. It could be something as simple as a minor imbalance in your gut flora, or, less commonly, something else. If it persists, we could discuss further testing, such as a stool sample to check for any underlying infections or imbalances. We could also consider a referral to a gastroenterologist for more specialized evaluation. But let’s start with the simpler steps first and see how you respond. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You have explained everything very clearly. A food diary, simethicone, and more water… and then we see how it goes. And if it doesn’t help, we can do more tests. That sounds like a good plan. I am very grateful for your help, Doctor Reisig. It is a relief to have someone listen and offer a solution. Thank you again. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll follow up in a couple of weeks to see how you’re doing. And you have a good day as well. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will call if I need anything. Goodbye to you as well. .
