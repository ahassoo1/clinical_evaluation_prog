DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doc. It’s this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a couple weeks now, and it’s really starting to bug me. Like, constantly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. We call that tinnitus. A couple weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two weeks now. It’s not painful, exactly… just… annoying. Really annoying. It makes it hard to concentrate, you know? Especially at work. I'm a waiter, so things get pretty loud.
DOCTOR: Right, a waiter. Loud environment. Is it constant, this ringing, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant. There are times when it’s quieter, like if I’m really focused on something, or if it’s really quiet around me… but it's always there, in the background, you know? Even now, I can hear it. It's like a high-pitched whine, mostly.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. And has anything specific happened in the last couple of weeks that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. Work's been the same, nothing special happened there. I… got divorced a few months ago, but that was pretty stressful, yeah, but the ringing didn't start right after that. It started a while after. I don't know if that matters?
DOCTOR: Divorce a few months ago… stress can certainly contribute to things. It's good you mention that. But let’s focus on the ringing itself for now. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear. Sometimes it feels like it's in both, but it's definitely louder and more noticeable on the right side. It’s hard to explain… it’s not like a sound I’m hearing, more like… a feeling, and a sound, all mixed together?
DOCTOR: Okay. A feeling and a sound. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I’ve been a bit tired lately, but that’s probably just from work. And, uh, maybe a little more on edge than usual, but again, that could be… everything, you know? Nothing specifically with my ears, just the ringing. No dizziness, no pain, no trouble hearing things… just the whine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever been exposed to any really loud noises?
PATIENT: Loud noises? Yeah, all the time at work, like I said. And before that… I used to go to a few concerts, back when I had more free time. Not like, right up front, but definitely loud. It's been a while though, years. I don’t think that’s it?
DOCTOR: Concerts… okay. Do you have any family history of hearing problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of, no. My mum always said she had good hearing, and my dad… I don’t really remember him being particularly bothered by sounds. I haven’t asked my brother, though. He lives on the other side of the island. Maybe I should? I don’t know. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let's do a quick exam. I'm going to take a look in your ears, check your hearing a little bit. Just want to rule out anything obvious. Okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Sounds good. Hopefully it’s nothing too bad. I just want it to stop buzzing, you know? It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. Okay, right ear looks clear. A little bit of cerumen, but nothing significant. Left ear also clear. Now, I’m going to do a quick tuning fork test. I'm going to tap this, and you tell me when you can't hear it anymore. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Tuning fork… right. Just tell you when I can't hear it? It’s… a weird sound. Is it normal for it to feel… tingly?
DOCTOR: It can be a little strange. A tingly sensation is not uncommon. Just focus on listening for the sound, and tell me when it fades away. Go ahead.
PATIENT: Okay… um… I can hear it… yeah, it’s… fading… fading… okay, I can't hear it anymore. Just now. It stopped a few seconds ago. Is that… good or bad? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That's fine, don't worry. Not everyone is. It appears you have some mild hearing loss in the higher frequencies, particularly in the right ear. It's not drastic, but it correlates with the tinnitus you're experiencing. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes… uh… is that going to hurt? I’m a bit jumpy, you know, especially with this buzzing in my ears. It makes me feel… on edge. What does this mean? About the hearing loss, I mean? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt. Just relax. It's a simple test. The reflexes are normal. As for the hearing loss, it's mild, and it's likely contributing to the tinnitus. It’s not serious in the sense that it's not indicative of a larger problem, but it is something we need to address. It's likely noise-induced. The constant exposure at work, and the concerts… it takes a toll. Now, let's talk about management. There's no cure for tinnitus, unfortunately, but there are ways to cope.
PATIENT: Cope… right. Okay. No cure… that’s… disappointing. But coping is good, I guess. What kind of coping? Like… earplugs at work? Because I don’t think my boss would be too happy if I started wearing earplugs, you know? He says I need to be able to hear the customers. What else is there? Is there… medicine? Anything to make it stop buzzing? I really just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Earplugs are a good first step, despite your boss’s concerns. Explain to him it’s for your health, and that you can still hear adequately. There are custom-fitted earplugs designed for musicians and waiters that reduce noise levels without completely blocking sound. As for medicine… there are no medications specifically to stop tinnitus. Some antidepressants can help manage the associated anxiety and sleep disturbances, but they won't eliminate the ringing. We can explore tinnitus retraining therapy, which uses sound masking to help you habituate to the noise. It requires commitment, though. And realistically, you need to be very diligent about noise protection.
PATIENT: Habituate… sound masking… It sounds like a lot of work. And expensive work, probably. I'm not sure I can afford a lot of therapy. I mean, I'm just a waiter, you know? I'm divorced, I'm trying to get back on my feet… I just want a simple fix. Is there anything simple? Like… a pill, or some drops for my ears? I don’t want to be wearing earplugs for the rest of my life. I really don’t. What about… is it possible it will just go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there's rarely a "simple fix" for tinnitus. The chances of it resolving on its own are slim, especially since it's been two weeks. Drops won't help. Pills won't help. You've already been exposed to significant noise damage, and that's not easily reversed. I can refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss tinnitus retraining therapy in more detail. They can assess your specific needs and create a personalized management plan. They can also advise you on appropriate ear protection. Look, I understand this is frustrating. But realistically, you need to take proactive steps to protect your hearing and manage the symptoms. Ignoring it won't make it go away, and it could potentially worsen over time. Do you want me to proceed with the referral?
PATIENT: …Okay. Yeah, fine. Do the referral. I guess I don’t have much choice, do I? I just… I really didn’t want to be going to specialists and spending money. But if that’s what I have to do… …Just… tell me where to go, and what it’s going to cost. And… is there anything I can do right now to make it a little quieter? Anything at all? I’m just… so tired of hearing that buzzing.
DOCTOR: Here's the referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, she's an excellent audiologist. The cost will depend on the specific tests and therapy options you choose, but your insurance should cover a significant portion. You'll need to call their office to schedule an appointment and verify your coverage. As for something you can do right now… try to avoid loud noises as much as possible. If you’re in a noisy environment, take breaks and get away from the sound. White noise can sometimes help mask the tinnitus – a fan, a quiet radio, even a calming app on your phone. It won't eliminate it, but it might make it a little more bearable. Look, this is a process. It's not going to get better overnight. But with diligent management, you can learn to cope with the tinnitus and improve your quality of life. Do you have any other questions before you go?
