DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 83 years young. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, eighty-three. Feels like yesterday I was a young man, honestly. Well, it’s this weakness, you see. It’s been getting worse. Not all at once, but… slower and slower, if that makes sense. It’s in my legs mostly, and sometimes my arms feel tired too. It makes walking a bit difficult.
DOCTOR: Slower and slower, you say. Hmm. And when did you first begin to notice this weakness, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a good question. It wasn’t sudden, like. Maybe… six months ago? No, maybe longer. A year, perhaps? It started just feeling a little clumsy, you know? Like I needed a bit more effort to get going. I didn’t think much of it at first, just figured it was getting old. But it’s… not going away.
DOCTOR: A year ago, progressively worsening. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly there. Some days are better than others, but it's never completely gone. Like today, getting out of the car was a bit of a struggle. But yesterday, I was able to do a little gardening, though it tired me out quicker than usual. It's not a sudden thing, it just… is. Most of the time. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… understandable. Constant, with fluctuations. Now, Mr. Astores, can you describe how it feels?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not pain, exactly. It’s more… heavy. Like trying to lift something very, very heavy all the time. And sometimes… my legs feel… numb. Not completely, just… less feeling. And shaky, sometimes. Like jelly. Is that… helpful? I'm trying my best to describe it.
DOCTOR: Heavy, numbness, shakiness. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your balance, Mr. Astores?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. I’m a bit wobbly, you see. Not all the time, but I have to hold onto things sometimes, especially when I turn quickly. My wife worries about me falling. She's a good woman. I haven't fallen yet, but it feels like I could, if I wasn't careful. It's a bit frightening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Balance issues, increasing risk of falls. Now, Mr. Astores, let's move on to other areas. Have you experienced any difficulty with bowel or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… a personal question, Doctor. Well, yes. A little bit. Sometimes it’s harder to… go. And sometimes I have to go more often. It’s not terrible, but it’s… noticeable. I try not to drink too much water before bed, if that makes sense. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: It is. Changes in bowel and bladder function can be indicative of several things. Now, have you noticed any muscle cramps or twitching?
PATIENT: Muscle cramps… Sometimes, yes. In my legs, mostly. Not every day, but when I walk for too long, or if I try to stand for a while. It's not a bad pain, but it's… uncomfortable. And twitching… I don't think so. Not that I've noticed, anyway. My wife might have seen something when I'm sleeping, but she hasn't mentioned it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Astores, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I've been lucky that way. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always checks before I take anything new, just to be safe, of course. She’s very careful. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. Never been hospitalized for anything, thankfully. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… Just one. For my blood pressure. My doctor prescribed it a few years ago. It’s… amlodipine, I think? Small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine and ibuprofen as needed. Now, Mr. Astores, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My doctor told me I had high cholesterol a few years back, but he said it was manageable with diet and exercise. And my mother had arthritis, like me. I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything serious, like heart disease or stroke. Nothing like that. Should I be worried about something?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily, Mr. Astores. It's simply important to have a complete picture. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I’ve been a lucky man, all my life. Just the usual childhood illnesses, like measles and chickenpox, but nothing that required a hospital stay. My wife always says I'm too stubborn to get sick. She’s probably right. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My father, he had heart trouble when he got older. He passed away when he was in his seventies. And my sister, she had diabetes, but I don’t know much about it. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, all her life. Never got sick a day in her life. Is that what you were asking about? It’s hard to remember everything, you know, at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me! And alcohol… just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Never been one for getting drunk. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I like my garden, my church, and my wife. That’s enough for me. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Astores, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle, if you don't mind. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is elevated, 160 over 90. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are diminished. Strength is 4/5 in upper extremities, 3/5 in lower extremities. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Alright, Mr. Astores. Thank you. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… and strength… 3/5? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? And the swelling in my ankles… What does all this mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’ve been feeling so tired lately… Could that be related? I know you need to do tests and everything, but… can you give me a little bit of an idea? Just to calm my nerves?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, your symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of several possibilities. The diminished reflexes, weakness in your legs, swelling in your ankles, and fatigue could indicate a neurological issue, a vascular problem, or a combination of factors. It is too early to make a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. I am going to order a comprehensive blood panel to assess your overall health, including kidney function, liver function, and thyroid levels. I will also order an MRI of your spine and legs to evaluate your nerves and muscles. I will also order an EKG to rule out any heart problems. These tests will help me determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I understand you are anxious, and I will do my best to get you answers as quickly as possible. We need to rule out serious conditions first. I will call you with the results as soon as they become available. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. And a comprehensive blood panel… I’ve never had so many tests before. So, you’re saying it could be something serious? Like… what kind of serious? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting… especially when I don’t know what’s wrong. Could it be… my age? Is it just… old age catching up with me? And… will these tests be expensive? My Medicare… is that going to cover everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astores, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize for the worry these tests may cause. It is important to remember that these tests are being ordered to rule out serious conditions, not to confirm them. As for what it could be, the possibilities range from nerve compression to vascular disease to neurological disorders. It is too early to speculate without the test results. Regarding the timeline, the blood tests should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI, however, may take a few days to schedule and another few days for the results to be interpreted by a radiologist. I will contact you as soon as I have the results. As for the cost, your Medicare should cover the majority of these tests. There may be a co-pay or deductible, depending on your plan. My office staff will assist you with any billing questions you may have. It is important to remember that aging is a natural process, and some decline in function is expected. However, your symptoms are progressing at a rate that warrants further investigation. We need to determine the underlying cause and ensure you receive the appropriate care. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. It’s a lot to take in, Doctor. A lot. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. Don’t keep me waiting. And thank you… for taking the time to listen to me. And for explaining everything, even though I don't understand most of it. I think I’ll go home now… and try not to worry too much. But it’s hard, Doctor. It’s very hard. Thank you again. And… goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Astores. My staff will assist you with scheduling the tests and answer any questions you may have. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please do not hesitate to call my office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Goodbye, Mr. Astores. And please, try to rest.
