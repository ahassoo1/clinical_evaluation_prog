DOCTOR: Alright, Chellsea, so you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Um, well, it’s about the… the cancer. It’s been… a little hard lately. I don’t really know how to explain it. It just… hurts more.
DOCTOR: “Cancer.” Right. And… which cancer are we talking about, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… the one in my… my lung. They told me it was lung cancer, a while back. I… I don’t remember all the fancy words they used, sorry. It was after… after my husband passed. Things were kind of blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say it “hurts more,” can you be specific?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like… a constant ache, but now it feels like… sharp pains sometimes? Especially when I breathe deep, or if I try to… lift anything. It makes me really tired, too. I have to sit down a lot more than I used to.
DOCTOR: "Sharp pains", alright. And where exactly are you feeling these pains?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly on this side. <points to her right side> Like, right here in my chest. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way to my back, too. It's hard to tell. It just… feels bad. I haven’t been able to do much around the house lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just pull up your records here… Hmm. So, you were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer approximately… two years ago, treated with… chemotherapy and radiation. Last follow-up was… over a year ago. And you haven’t seen anyone since?
PATIENT: That sounds right. Two years ago… yes. And… no, I haven’t. After… after Robert… I just… I didn’t really want to go. It felt like… too much. Everything felt too much. <she looks down at her hands, twisting them together> I probably should have, though. I know I should have.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… unfortunate. It’s important to keep up with these things, you know. Alright. I’m going to need to do a physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. <slowly stands, wincing slightly> Is it okay if I… take my time? It feels a little stiff today.
DOCTOR: Take your time. <gestures towards the examination table> If you could just sit there for me. I'm going to listen to your lungs first. Deep breaths, in and out.
PATIENT: Okay. <carefully sits on the examination table> Deep breaths… right. <takes a few shaky, deliberate breaths> Like this? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the right side, and some… wheezing. Not terribly surprising, given your history. <moves the stethoscope around to different areas of her back> Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. <flinches slightly as the doctor presses on her back> Right there… it hurts a little. Not… terrible, but… definitely feels it. Like a… dull ache, but sharper when you push. <closes her eyes briefly>
DOCTOR: <stage>Continues the exam, palpating her chest and back with a brisk, impersonal manner.> Alright. And what about your lymph nodes?
PATIENT: Lymph… nodes? I… I don’t know what those are. Or where they are. I’m sorry. <looks at the doctor with a confused expression>
DOCTOR: <stage>Sighs audibly, tapping the pen against the chart again. Briefly demonstrates where lymph nodes are located, then proceeds to palpate them.> They’re… little glands. We’re checking for swelling. <pauses, continuing to palpate> Hmm. I do feel some slight enlargement on the right side of your neck and… under your arm. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate further. <removes gloves> Okay. I think we need to get a chest X-ray and a CT scan. And I’m going to order some blood work.
PATIENT: Okay… X-ray and… CT scan. And blood work. That sounds… a lot. <looks worried> Is it… is it bad? Is the cancer… worse? <fidgets with her hands> I just… I don’t want to go through all that again. It was really hard last time.
DOCTOR: <stage>Avoids eye contact, typing quickly on the computer.> Look, it’s difficult to say definitively without the results of these tests. It’s possible it’s a recurrence, or just inflammation. We need to rule things out. I'm going to write you referrals for the radiology department. You’ll need to schedule these appointments. And the lab order will be sent electronically to the lab downtown. <hands her a slip of paper with the radiology referral> It's important to get these done as soon as possible. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Okay… as soon as possible. I understand. <takes the paper, looking at it with a concerned expression> Downtown… that’s… a bit of a drive. And I… I don't have a lot of help getting around these days. <pauses> Will my insurance cover it? I’m on Medicare.
DOCTOR: <stage>Looks up briefly, a flicker of annoyance crossing her face.> Medicare should cover it, yes. But you’ll need to verify with the radiology department and the lab beforehand to be certain. I can have the front desk staff print out some information about coverage options for you. Don’t leave it until the last minute, alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that would be… helpful. Thank you. <looks down at the referral again> So, X-ray, CT scan, blood work… and call about insurance. Is there… anything else? <looks up at the doctor, hoping for some reassurance>
DOCTOR: <stage>Starts typing notes into the computer again, not making eye contact.> We'll need to review the results when they come back, and then we can discuss potential treatment options. For now, just focus on getting those tests scheduled. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – significant shortness of breath, severe pain, fever – go to the emergency room immediately. Don't wait. <pauses, without looking up> Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Um… <hesitates> Well… I was just wondering… is there anything I can do to… help myself? While I’m waiting for the tests? <looks hopeful> Like, anything I can eat, or… exercises I can do? I just… I want to feel… less helpless. <fidgets with her hands>
DOCTOR: Look, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is always a good idea. Eat a balanced diet, get some rest, try to manage your stress. But frankly, there's not much you can do to significantly impact the course of the disease at this point. We need to see what the tests reveal before we can formulate a plan. Don't waste your energy on things that aren't evidence-based. <starts closing the file> Is there anything else?
