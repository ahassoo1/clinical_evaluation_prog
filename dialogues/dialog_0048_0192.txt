DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Hartness, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Delron Hartness. Look, I ain't got all day, you know? Got a test to pass. Military thing. Important.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we all have commitments. However, a proper medical assessment is important, regardless. So, if you could just tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's for the exam, like I said. They want me to get checked out before I... before I join up. Just makin' sure I'm good to go. No point gettin' rejected 'cause of somethin' silly, right? I feel fine. Always have. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Except for that one time with the... never mind. It wasn't nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a pre-employment physical. And you state you generally feel well. Let's try to be a bit more specific. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? I wake up, I go to work. I come home, I eat. Sometimes I fix things, sometimes I watch the news. It's... normal. Look, I work with engines all day. It takes a lot outta a man. I'm always tired, if that's what you mean. But that's just life, isn't it? Not exactly a new development.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah. Not really. Well, my back gets a bit stiff sometimes. From bendin' over those machines all day, ya know? But it's nothin' a good stretch can't fix. And my hands ache a bit now and then, but that's just from usin' tools. It's work. What do you expect? I ain't askin' for a vacation, just need a signature so I can get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty breathing, even with exertion?
PATIENT: Breathing? What are ya, suspectin' I got somethin' wrong with my lungs? I work with engines, remember? I breathe in fumes all day, but I ain't coughin' up a lung, if that's what you're gettin' at. I can run a mile, I can lift heavy stuff. I'm a strong man. It's just... what kinda doctor asks questions like this? Seems a bit much, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Hartness. We need to rule out any potential issues. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Look, I eat regular. Maybe I lost a pound or two in the summer heat? It's been hot, ya know? But I ain't exactly disappearin' here. I'm a solid build, always have been. And I definitely haven't gained weight. My wife would tell me if I had. She notices these things. It's just... are you tryin' to find somethin' wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, any issues with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion? What now? You askin' about my... stomach? Look, I eat, it goes through. Sometimes it makes noise, sometimes it doesn't. Everyone's stomach makes noise. I haven't had any... problems, if that's what you mean. No fancy issues, no nothin'. It's all pretty normal. Honestly, this is startin' to feel a bit ridiculous. I need this form signed. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. Not once. I told you, I'm a healthy man. Always have been. My family's strong. We don't get sick. No fancy names for things, no doctors tellin' us what's wrong. Just hard work and a good diet. Look, is this gonna take long? I'm startin' to get a bit annoyed, frankly. I need this signed so I can get on with my life. It's the military, you know. They don't wait for no one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had surgery. Why would I have surgery? I haven't been broken or nothin'. I fix machines, I don't need fixin'. Seriously, are you always this thorough with everyone? It's a bit much, don't ya think? I just need a rubber stamp and I'm outta here. Time is money, you know. And I'm wastin' it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What about 'em? They're fine. My wife's healthy, kids are grown up and doin' alright. My father lived to be eighty-five, strong as an ox right till the end. Mother was healthy too, 'til she… well, never mind. Point is, good genes. We're a sturdy bunch. Not much in the way of sickness. Why do you need to know all this, anyway? Is this standard for a military exam or are you just tryin' to make small talk? Because frankly, I don't have time for small talk.
DOCTOR: It's just standard procedure, Mr. Hartness. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. Never had an allergy in my life. I can eat anything, touch anything. Dust doesn't bother me, pollen doesn't bother me, nothin'. I’m a Swede, we're built tough. Honestly, this is gettin' ridiculous. I feel like I'm bein' interrogated, not examined. Can we please just get this over with? I need this form signed today.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. None. Not a single pill. I don’t believe in relyin’ on fancy drugs. A bit of hard work and a good night’s sleep is all a man needs. I don't need nothin’ from a bottle. Are you almost done? I really gotta go. My wife is expectin' me. And I told her I'd be back hours ago. This is a waste of everyone's time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me just do a quick physical exam, and then we can be finished. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Lie down? What for? I've told you, I'm fine! I don’t need pokin’ and proddin’. I feel perfectly healthy. Look, I’m a practical man, I deal with machines, not doctors. I can feel if somethin’s wrong with me, I don’t need you to tell me. Just sign the form, please. It's a waste of time to lie down. I'm strong and healthy, that's all you need to know. Honestly, I’m startin’ to get really annoyed. This is ridiculous!
