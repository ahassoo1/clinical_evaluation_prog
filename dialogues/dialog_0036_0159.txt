DOCTOR: Good morning, Elijiah. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird, honestly. I’ve just been… having trouble gettin’ up out of chairs. Like, it ain’t painful, exactly, but it takes a lot of effort. And sometimes I just… can’t. It’s been goin’ on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay. That is a bit unusual. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Around then, give or take a few days. It started gradually, I think. At first, I just noticed I was movin’ a little slower gettin’ up, but now… well, like yesterday, I was at the diner, and I really had to struggle to push myself outta the booth. It was kinda embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is frustrating when your body doesn't cooperate, and embarrassing too. So, it’s mostly difficulty rising from a seated position?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's the main thing. It doesn’t bother me much when I’m standin’ or walkin’, and layin’ down’s no problem. Just… that first push outta a chair. It feels like… I dunno, like my legs are heavy, or somethin’. And it’s not every chair, not exactly. Like, a hard wooden chair’s worse than somethin’ soft, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That detail about the chair type is helpful. It sounds like it could be related to the muscles used to initiate that movement, or potentially something with your joints. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not much, really. I’ve been kinda tired lately, but that’s normal for the job, you know? Roustabout work’s hard. No pain anywhere else, no numbness or tingly feelings. I haven’t fallen or anything, and my balance feels okay. I guess… maybe my knees feel a little stiff sometimes in the mornin’, but I always figured that was just from bein’ on ‘em so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness with your line of work is understandable. And the morning knee stiffness… that's good information too. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No swelling, not that I've seen. I check 'em sometimes, 'cause I’m always worried about blowin’ a knee on the job. They look normal, feel normal... just a little tight in the mornin’. It usually works itself out after I get movin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any past injuries to your knees, legs, or back?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Years ago, back when I was… uh, maybe 19 or so, I twisted my knee pretty bad playin’ soccer. Tore somethin’ in it, I think. Had to wear a brace for a while. They said it healed up okay, and it mostly did. Never bothered me much after that, until… well, until recently. It wasn't the same kind of pain, though. This ain’t like a sharp twistin’ pain, it’s more like… weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that history of a knee injury is important. And you're right, weakness is different than a sharp pain. Have you had any surgeries, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And no nothin’ major, Doc. Just the usual colds and flu. I try to stay healthy, gotta be in good shape for the job. I don’t really go to doctors much, unless somethin’s broken or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' at all. I don't like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Just coffee to get me goin’ in the mornin’, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And you don't have any allergies to anything that you know of?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies as far as I know. I’ve eaten all sorts of weird stuff out in the field, never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, go ahead. Whatever you need. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your range of motion. Can you extend your legs out straight in front of you?
PATIENT: Yeah, no problem. Feels alright. A little stiff, maybe, but nothin' painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that’s okay too. It feels… tighter than usual, but I can do it. It's not a sharp pain, more like a stretchin' feel, in the back of my legs.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And now I’m going to check your strength. Could you please try to push your legs against my hands as I resist?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Just tell me when to push.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, good strength in both legs, although I do note some slight weakness with extension, particularly in the right leg. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Your reflexes are present and symmetrical. Finally, I’m going to listen to your knees and hips with the stethoscope. Your joints sound clear. Alright, Elijiah. Based on the exam, you have good range of motion, although slightly limited, symmetrical reflexes, and clear joint sounds. The slight weakness in your right leg extension, coupled with your history of a previous knee injury, is concerning.
PATIENT: Okay, that…doesn’t sound too good. What do you think is goin’ on, Doc? Is it somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: It’s hard to say definitively without further testing, but based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it could be a few things. It could be a re-injury or aggravation of the old knee injury, possibly involving some muscle weakness or a minor cartilage issue. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is something affecting the nerves in your leg, or potentially an early sign of osteoarthritis. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some X-rays of both knees. This will help us see the bone structure and rule out any significant structural problems. I’d also like to order a basic blood test, just to rule out any inflammatory conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. X-rays and blood tests, right? No problem. I don’t have insurance, though. How much is all that gonna cost?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, and I understand your concern. Let me explain the costs as best I can. The X-rays will likely be around $150 to $200, depending on the number of views needed. The blood test will be approximately $80 to $120. Because you don’t have insurance, you’ll be responsible for the full cost. However, I can work with the billing department to see if we can offer a payment plan or a discount. We also have some resources available that may help with the cost of medical care. I'll have my assistant provide you with information about those resources after your appointment. In the meantime, I recommend taking it easy on your legs. Avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to take them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that's…a bit more than I was hopin’ for, but I guess it is what it is. A payment plan would be really helpful, so thank you for lookin’ into that. And yeah, I can take ibuprofen, no problem. I’ll lay off the heavy liftin’ for a bit, I guess. No sense makin’ it worse. So, how long do you think it’ll take to get the X-rays done? And will I need an appointment for that?
DOCTOR: Good. Avoiding heavy lifting is a smart move. The X-rays can typically be done at the imaging center across the street. They don’t usually require an appointment, but it’s best to call ahead to confirm their hours and wait times. My assistant will give you their number. They’ll send the results to me electronically, and I should have them within 24 to 48 hours. Once I’ve reviewed the results, I'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doc. You’ve been really helpful. I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. I’ll go give the imaging center a call right after this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Elijiah. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. My assistant will be with you shortly to go over the paperwork and provide you with the necessary information. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
