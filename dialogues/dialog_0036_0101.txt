DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Bacy. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting, right at the back of my head. Been bothering me for a little while now. Not constant, you know? Comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, really. Sometimes it feels like pressure, like somethin’ is tight back there. And it usually starts in the evenin', after I've been on my feet all day. Bein' a manicurist, you know, lots of bendin' and lookin' down. It don't usually last all night though, thankfully. Usually gone by mornin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache and pressure at the back of your head, worse in the evenings after being on your feet, and then it eases up by morning. That’s helpful. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give it when it's at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s never been a real bad pain, thankfully. I'd say… maybe a six? On a bad day, a six. Most days it's more like a three or four. Not cripplin', you know? Just… annoying. It makes it hard to relax sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six at its worst, usually around a three or four. And it interferes with relaxing. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Well, layin' down usually helps. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck. My wife, bless her heart, she makes me some chamomile tea sometimes, that seems to take the edge off too. Not a cure, mind you, but it calms me down, which probably helps with the headache.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – lying down, a cool cloth, and chamomile tea seem to offer some relief. Have you tried any pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: I have, yes. Tried some of them over-the-counter things. Acetaminophen, I think it was. Didn’t do much, to be honest. Maybe took the edge off for a little bit, but it didn’t really get rid of it. Don’t really like takin' pills if I don't have to, you know? Prefer the natural remedies if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. You prefer to avoid medication if you can. Now, besides the headache, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness or nothin’ like that. No blurry vision. I’ve been sleepin' alright, I suppose. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I am 87, you know? Could just be old age creepin' in. No nausea, no fever, nothin' like that. Just the headache. Oh! Actually… sometimes my neck feels a bit stiff when the headache is bad. But not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, blurry vision, nausea, or fever. You've been sleeping okay, some fatigue, and occasional neck stiffness when the headache is bad. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Everything’s workin' just fine, thankfully. I still manage to do a good job with my manicures, even with this headache. Wife keeps tellin’ me I should retire, but what would I do with myself? I like keepin’ busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re still able to work and stay active. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothing major. Had my appendix out when I was a young man, that’s about it. And I broke my arm once fallin’ off a ladder, fixin’ the roof. But that was a long time ago. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothin' like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken arm in the past, but otherwise generally healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with food, and I don’t really get bothered by pollen. Sometimes I sneeze a little in the spring, but that’s all. My wife’s the one with the allergies, she's always sneezin' and sniffin’. I’m pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you aren't currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That’s right. No medications at all. I prefer to keep it natural, like I said. My wife tries to get me to take somethin' for my joints, but I always refuse. I’d rather just take it easy when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your neck and the back of your head. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 76 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Your neck muscles are a little tense on both sides, and there's some tenderness when I press on the base of your skull, but no obvious swelling. Range of motion in your neck is slightly limited in all directions, but doesn’t cause any sharp pain. Neurological exam is normal – strength, sensation, and reflexes are all intact. I don’t detect any fever.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too bad, does it? A little tense, you say? Probably from bendin' over all day lookin' at toenails. I've been doin’ this for a long time, you know. It takes a toll on your body. But thank you for checkin’ everything. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly related to your occupation and the repetitive strain on your neck and upper back. These are very common. The tenderness at the base of your skull supports that. However, given your age, and just to be cautious, I’d like to get a quick blood test to rule out any other potential causes, such as inflammation or underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Always best to be safe, I suppose. Yes, go ahead and do the blood test. No problem at all. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a small sample of blood, and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with what you’ve already found helpful: rest, a cool cloth on your neck, and chamomile tea. We can also discuss some simple stretching exercises you can do throughout the day to help relieve tension in your neck and upper back. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, please! Stretching exercises would be great, Doctor. I’m always up for tryin’ somethin’ that might help. Anything to keep this headache at bay. Thank you for takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel a lot better already, just knowin' what we're lookin' for.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Okay, so start by gently tilting your head towards your shoulder, hold for 15-20 seconds, and repeat on both sides. Then, slowly rotate your head from side to side, looking over your shoulder. And finally, gently tuck your chin towards your chest and then lift your head back up. Do each exercise 10-15 times, a few times a day. Remember to stop if you feel any sharp pain. I’ll also print out a handout with these exercises for you to take home. Once we have the blood test results back, we can discuss further treatment options if needed. But for now, let's focus on managing the symptoms and preventing future headaches with these stretches and self-care techniques. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense, Doctor. They seem simple enough. I think I can manage those. A handout would be great, just to remind me. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You've explained everything so thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and kindness. I’ll go and get the blood test done now, and I’ll look forward to hearin’ from you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be right in to escort you to the lab. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. And I appreciate your help very much.
