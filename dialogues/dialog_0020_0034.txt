DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too. I just... moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up? My husband said something about getting settled with… healthcare. I don’t really remember all the details. It’s a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Settling in is a lot. A general check-up is a great place to start. It sounds like this might be your first visit with us. Just to be thorough, even though you said you don’t remember details, let’s try to get a little bit of your medical history. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?
PATIENT: No, no, that's okay. Questions are fine. I probably won’t remember much of it anyway, but… go ahead. It’s just… things have been kinda fuzzy lately. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s perfectly okay to say. “Fuzzy” is a good way to put it. We can take things at your pace. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I… don't think so? I mean, not that I remember. I had… something when I was little? A really bad ear infection, maybe? But that was ages ago. My husband usually handles all this stuff, so I’m really not sure. He said something about… specialists, once? But I don’t know what for. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. It’s alright if you don’t remember specifics. We can always try to access records if that’s something you’d be comfortable with. We'll get there. Okay, how about any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries. No hospital stays… that I know of. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. Just a cast. It was a really big tree. But that was a long time ago. I think. Honestly, it’s all kinda mixed up in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospital stays. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family—things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my grandma, on my mom’s side, had… something with her heart? I think. She was really old, though. And my uncle… he had, like, really bad headaches? But that’s all I really know. My mom wasn’t very good at remembering things either, so… it was hard to keep track. Sorry, I’m not much help.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Emileigh. It's alright if the details are hazy. We’re just trying to get a general picture. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that. Never. My husband doesn't either. We’re pretty… healthy, I think. We mostly just… work. And try to relax when we can. It’s not much, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, just to finish up this part of the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I had a rash once, when I was little, after eating strawberries? But it was a really long time ago, and I’m not even sure if it was the strawberries. And… I don't think I'm allergic to any medications. My husband always double-checks everything. I really don't keep track of this stuff, sorry. Is it okay if he comes in to help with some of these questions? It might be easier.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. That’s perfectly fine, and it sounds like a good idea. We want to make sure we have the most accurate information possible. If you’re comfortable, we can pause here and have him join us. Or, if you prefer, we can continue, and you can let me know if anything comes to mind later. Would you like me to call him in now?
PATIENT: Yes, please! That would be… amazing. I feel bad making you ask me all these questions when I can’t remember anything. He’s really good at this stuff. It would be so much easier if he was here. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're not causing any trouble at all, Emileigh. It’s completely understandable. We want to get a good picture of your health, and having your husband here will be very helpful. While we wait, perhaps we can do a quick check of your vital signs – just your height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need. I’m not good with needles, just so you know. If you need to draw blood or anything… please tell me first.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll definitely let you know before we do anything involving needles, and we can absolutely go at your pace. No surprises here. Let's start with your height and weight. I see here you're listed as 150 centimeters. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Um… maybe? I haven't really measured myself in a long time. I’m pretty short, I think. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, for calculating certain medications and understanding your overall health picture. But it’s not a big deal if you’re not sure. Just stand here comfortably, and we’ll get a quick measurement. Okay, it shows 82 kilograms. That's about 181 pounds. And your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within a normal range, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Do you have any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I get tired a lot, but that’s just from work. And sometimes my head hurts, but it’s just a little headache. Nothing major. I thought it was just stress, mostly. I’m probably just out of shape. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Fatigue and occasional headaches are common. We can explore those a bit further. When you say you get tired, is it a constant fatigue, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant. But it gets worse after work. Like, really dragging. I just feel… worn out. And it doesn't really get better with sleep, not really. It's just… always there, a little bit. I just thought it was part of getting older, maybe? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant fatigue that doesn’t improve much with sleep. That’s good information. And you mentioned occasional headaches. Can you describe those headaches a little more?
PATIENT: They’re… just kind of a dull ache, mostly. Across my forehead. Not really throbbing, not really sharp. They come and go, like, a few times a week. And they’re usually not too bad, I can usually just ignore them. Sometimes they get a little worse when I’m stressed, but… not always. They’re just… annoying, mostly. Nothing I really worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache across the forehead, a few times a week, potentially related to stress. And you said you’ve been feeling this fatigue and having these headaches for…?
PATIENT: Oh… gosh. That's a good question. I think… a few months? Maybe longer? It’s hard to remember exactly. Things have been kinda… blurry lately, like I said. It just kinda… gradually got worse, I guess. It didn’t happen all at once. Sorry, I’m really not very helpful with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. We'll work with what we have. A few months of gradually worsening fatigue and headaches. Let's talk about other parts of your body. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think my appetite has been a little lower lately? I don’t really feel hungry as much. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight? But I haven't really been weighing myself, so I’m not sure. My husband said I look a little thinner, but he also said I’m always worrying too much. I really don’t pay much attention to that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and possible weight loss. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And definitely no night sweats. I sleep pretty normally, just… tired. Sometimes I wake up a little stiff, but that’s probably just the mattress. I don’t think I’m sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urination?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Everything seems pretty normal in that department. Sorry, that’s probably a weird question. I just… don’t really talk about that stuff. Is this part of the check-up?
DOCTOR: It is part of the check-up, yes. It's important to get a complete picture. No changes in bowel habits or urination, that's good to know. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain or shortness of breath. And no… what was that other word? Pal… something? No, nothing like that. I get a little anxious sometimes, but that's just about work. My heart feels okay, I think. I'm probably just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, have you noticed any skin rashes, itching, or changes in moles?
PATIENT: Um… no, nothing really. I get a little dry skin in the winter, but that's just from the cold. And I don't think I've noticed any changes in my moles. I don't really pay much attention to them, to be honest. I don't think I've had any rashes or anything weird like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Last question for now. Have you noticed any joint pain, swelling, or stiffness?
PATIENT: Actually… yeah, a little. My knees sometimes feel a little achy, especially after work. And they feel a little stiff in the mornings. But it's not too bad, I just thought it was from being on my feet all day. It's probably nothing. Just getting old, I guess. Is that it for the questions?
DOCTOR: That's it for the questions, for now. Thank you, Emileigh. That was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all. It's just listening and feeling. We'll start with your heart and lungs. Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and out… good. Another one… and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little there, on the right side. Not bad, just… sensitive. Like a dull ache, maybe? It's been a little sore lately, but I thought it was just from sleeping wrong. Yeah, that’s a little tender. But it's not… sharp or anything. Just uncomfortable. I'm probably just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed some tenderness there as well. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, and let me know if you feel any pain or clicking?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit of pain when I bend them like that. Not too bad, just a little ache in the front. And… yeah, I think I can hear a little clicking sound. It's been happening for a while now, I just thought it was normal. It's probably just getting old, like I said. I’m not sure what’s wrong, though.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling a little bit of swelling and warmth in both knees. I also feel some crepitus – that’s the clicking sound you’re hearing – when you bend them. Okay, Emileigh, thank you for letting me do that examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, you’re experiencing fatigue, occasional headaches, decreased appetite, possible weight loss, tenderness in your right abdomen, and some swelling and clicking in both knees. Given your symptoms and the findings on the exam, I’d like to order a few lab tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. These include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. I’d also like to order X-rays of both knees to evaluate the joint space and look for any signs of arthritis.
PATIENT: Lab tests and X-rays… okay. That sounds… serious. What are you looking for? Is something really wrong? I was just hoping it was something simple, like… being tired from work. Will these tests tell you what's wrong?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel a little overwhelmed, Emileigh. We're ordering these tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on, not necessarily because I think something is seriously wrong. It's better to be thorough and rule things out. The complete blood count will check for anemia or infection. The comprehensive metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte levels. The C-reactive protein level will help us look for inflammation in your body. And the thyroid-stimulating hormone level will check for any thyroid problems, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause fatigue and other symptoms. The X-rays of your knees will help us evaluate the joint space and look for any signs of arthritis. Based on the results of these tests, we can then determine the best course of action. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or a minor infection, or it could be something more complex. But we won't know until we get the results. I'll write you a lab order for these tests. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. A week… yeah, that’s good. I guess I’ll go to the lab and get these tests done. Will they call me if something is wrong? Or do I have to call you? I'm not very good at keeping track of these things, so I hope it's not too complicated.
DOCTOR: Here's the lab order. The lab will usually call you with the results, but it’s a good idea to check with them about their policy. If you haven’t heard anything within a few days, please call my office, and we can help you get the results. I’ll also make a note in your chart to check on you in a week. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for listening, Dr. Beinborn. I was worried you wouldn’t believe me. I just… get tired a lot. And I forget things. It’s nice to finally talk to someone about it. I hope the tests don’t find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It's my job to listen, and I believe you. We'll get to the bottom of this together. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Emileigh. We’ll see you next week.
