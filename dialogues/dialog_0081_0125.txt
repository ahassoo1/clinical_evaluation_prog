DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, my wife suggested I come in. She’s a bit… anxious, you know? Wants me to get checked for everything. Specifically, she mentioned HIV. I don’t think I need it, honestly, but better safe than sorry, I suppose. I haven’t… well, you know. No funny business. Just routine, really.
DOCTOR: Routine, alright. While I appreciate your wife’s diligence, Mr. Belan, and it's always wise to be proactive about your health, framing it as a “routine” HIV check doesn’t quite align with standard medical practice. It's generally indicated when there's a reason to suspect exposure. However, we can certainly proceed with testing if that will put your wife’s mind at ease. First, let's clarify a few things. Can you tell me about any potential risks, however small you might deem them?
PATIENT: Risks? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty straightforward guy. Married fifteen years, same wife. We don’t… socialize much. I work in compliance – paperwork, mostly. Very little excitement. I mean, I might have shared a razor once, ages ago, with my cousin when we visited Nepal, but that was… oh, ten years back, at least? Is a shared razor even a risk? Honestly, I think my wife watches too much television.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Belan, while the likelihood is extremely low, sharing razors can theoretically transmit infections, yes. It's not a common route, but it's not impossible. However, given your described lifestyle and the timeframe, the risk appears minimal. To be thorough, and to satisfy your wife's concerns, we'll proceed with the HIV test. But let’s also cover some broader health questions while we’re here. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Nothing major. A bit of a cold last winter, the usual sniffles. Nothing that required a doctor’s visit. I'm generally quite healthy. Good constitution, you know? We eat well, mostly. My wife is very particular about that. Vegetarian, mostly. Though I sneak in some chicken sometimes when she's not looking. Don't tell her I said that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, good constitution is helpful. Let’s stick to the medical details, if you don't mind. Any fevers, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, or swollen lymph nodes recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to worry me now. I mean, I get a little tired after work, but that’s because I’m staring at spreadsheets all day. And maybe I've lost a little weight, but my wife's been on a health kick lately, stricter portions and everything. Swollen lymph nodes? I don’t even know what those are. This is all a bit much for a simple HIV test, isn’t it? I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, this is not an interrogation. It’s a comprehensive medical history. These questions are necessary to assess your overall health and rule out other potential causes for any changes you might be experiencing. Dismissing symptoms as “just being tired” isn’t sound medical practice. Let's try this differently. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Doctor, really? This is getting… personal. I mean, everyone has bowel habits. What kind of question is that? I eat vegetarian food, mostly. It’s… regular. Look, I told you, I'm a healthy guy. This whole thing is becoming incredibly awkward. My wife is going to be so smug if I tell her you asked me about this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, avoiding these questions doesn’t help me assess your health. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of several conditions, and it is my professional responsibility to ask. Are you experiencing any diarrhea, constipation, blood in your stool, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fine! Yes, okay, maybe I’ve been a little constipated lately. But that’s because my wife switched to a new brand of lentils! They’re… fibrous. And no, there’s no blood, no pain, nothing dramatic. Honestly, I feel like you're looking for something that isn't there. I came in for an HIV test to appease my wife, not to have my entire digestive system scrutinized.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll proceed with the HIV test, as you requested. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider your dismissive attitude towards potential health concerns. Ignoring symptoms rarely leads to positive outcomes. Before we move on, let's quickly cover your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even as a child. I've always been lucky, I guess. A few colds, the occasional flu, but nothing serious enough for a hospital. My wife keeps telling everyone I'm "built like a tank," but that's just her being dramatic. Honestly, can we just get this test done? I've got paperwork waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! When I was a boy, in Nepal, I had my tonsils taken out. It was… a long time ago. Very basic, nothing fancy. They didn't have proper anesthesia or anything. But it healed fine. That’s the only surgery I've ever had. And honestly, it was more of a… procedure, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child. And finally, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I can eat anything. I'm pretty robust, like I said. No reactions to any medications either. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache, and even those don’t really seem to do much good. So, can we get to the test now? This is taking up a lot of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with the physical exam and then we'll draw the blood for the HIV test. Please follow me. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. I’ll also check your lymph nodes, despite your assertions. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m telling you, you won’t find anything. My wife just worries too much. And frankly, this whole thing is a bit insulting. I'm a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Please sit here, Mr. Belan. I’ll need you to remove your shirt. Take a deep breath... and exhale. Again... Heart rate is regular, lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… there. Just a bit. It’s probably just the lentils. My wife insisted on trying this new organic brand, said it’s better for digestion. It’s… causing some gas, let’s just say. And honestly, I'm not comfortable taking my shirt off. Is this really necessary? This feels very… invasive.
DOCTOR: It is necessary to assess for any abnormalities, Mr. Belan. Discomfort does not necessarily indicate a problem, but it warrants further investigation. Any swelling or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… a little tender. But that’s probably just… from shaving. I shave down there regularly, you know. It’s just irritation. Honestly, Doctor, are you looking for something? This is getting ridiculous. I came in for an HIV test, not a full physical examination. My wife is going to be insufferable if she hears about this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I am performing a thorough examination to ensure your well-being. Your dismissive attitude and reluctance to provide accurate information are hindering my ability to do so. You state you have no significant medical concerns, yet you are exhibiting tenderness in multiple areas and displaying symptoms that warrant further investigation. Given your reported constipation, abdominal discomfort, and lymph node tenderness, I recommend a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool analysis to rule out any underlying issues. We will proceed with the HIV test, as requested, but I strongly advise you to follow up with a gastroenterologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, whatever. Do your tests. I'll… I'll think about seeing a gastroenterologist. But honestly, this is all a waste of time. My wife is going to be so pleased with herself. Just get it over with, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. A phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. The results will be available in approximately five to seven business days. You will receive a call from the clinic to discuss them. And again, I strongly recommend you follow up with a gastroenterologist. Before you go, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… please tell my wife everything is fine. Even if it’s not. She worries too much. And honestly, I don't want to deal with another lecture. Just… get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. .
