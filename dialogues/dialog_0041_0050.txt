DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. My cough. It’s been… well, a long time now. A dry cough, mostly. Just… hacking away. Doesn't really hurt, just… bothersome. I don't even remember when it started, to be honest. Seems like forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-standing dry cough. That does sound bothersome. You said you don’t recall exactly when it began… that’s alright, we’ll try to piece things together. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… piece things together… yes. That sounds good. It’s just… fuzzy. I mostly notice it in the mornings, when the air is cool. And sometimes at night, keeps my wife up… well, used to keep my wife up. She… she passed a few years back. But it’s the same cough. Always has been. Not much phlegm, if that makes sense. Just… air. And a tickle. It doesn’t get worse with exercise, I don’t think. I don’t… do much exercising these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's been a pretty constant companion for a while now. Mornings and nights are worse, not much phlegm… and it doesn't seem to be aggravated by activity. Okay. And has anything changed about the cough recently?
PATIENT: Changed… let me think. No, not really. It's always been... pretty much the same. Maybe a little worse in the winter, when it's really cold. But nothing dramatic. I haven't… coughed up any blood, if that's what you're asking. My daughter, she worries sometimes. She keeps telling me I should see a doctor, which is why I’m here, I suppose. Though I don’t remember feeling particularly worse lately. Just… old. I feel old.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no blood, and that it hasn't significantly changed. It's wise of your daughter to encourage you to come in. And feeling old is perfectly understandable. Alright, let’s do a quick examination, just to listen to your lungs and get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Listening to my lungs… good idea. I don't have much faith in these newfangled machines, but if you think it’ll help… go ahead. I used to be able to fix anything with just my hands and ears. Cars, mostly. But lungs… that’s a different story.
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes a good listen is all we need! I’ll just listen to your breathing, both in the front and the back. I may also use my light to look at your throat. Just breathe normally, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. …Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay… and again… Good. I'm hearing some… decreased air movement, especially in the lower lobes. Not dramatically decreased, but present. And a few scattered… mild wheezes. Do you ever feel short of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezes… decreased air movement… Short of breath… not really. Not lately. Maybe when I’m climbing stairs, but I haven’t climbed stairs in… well, a long time. I mostly just sit. I used to be very active, working on cars all day, but that was… decades ago. I do get a little tired easily, but I just figured that was… age. Is that bad? The tiredness, I mean. Not the stairs. I don’t do stairs.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s not unusual to feel more tired with age, but it's good to explore all possibilities. The decreased air movement and mild wheezing could be from a number of things. I'd like to take a quick look at your throat and ears just to rule out anything obvious. …Throat looks clear. Ears are also clear. No signs of infection. Now, do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. Never been much for hay fever or anything like that. Used to work around a lot of dust and grease, fixing cars, but that didn’t bother me. My wife, she was allergic to cats. I used to have to clean up all the fur. But I wasn't allergic. I don't think. Maybe a little sniffly sometimes, but who isn't? It’s hard to remember things these days. Old age, you know. It steals your memory.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that it's hard to remember. No known allergies, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… just a little something for my blood pressure. The little white pill. I take it every morning. Can't remember the name of it, though. My daughter, she fills the little pill box for me, so I don’t have to worry about it. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little something for that too. But not every day. It’s… a yellow pill, I think. Or maybe orange. Honestly, I just take what she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, and occasionally something for arthritis. It’s good your daughter helps manage those for you. Do you know what the dosage is for your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Dosage… Oh, goodness no. I wouldn’t know a dosage if it hit me in the face. She writes it on the little label, but my eyes aren't what they used to be. I just see a bunch of numbers and letters. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just here because my daughter said I should come. She worries about me. I just… feel old. And cough. I keep forgetting what I was going to say. Is it alright if she comes in? She’s better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly alright if your daughter comes in. It's very helpful to have someone else’s perspective. And it's completely understandable that you're feeling this way. Based on what you've told me, and what I've heard during the exam, it sounds like you may have some underlying chronic bronchitis, possibly with a component of mild asthma. The decreased air movement and wheezing support that. The long-standing cough and lack of fever suggest it’s not an acute infection. However, to get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, if you're willing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… and a… pulmonary function test? Oh, goodness. Sounds… serious. What does it mean? Is it bad? I just want to stop coughing. My daughter, she'll probably want me to do it, whatever it is. She always wants the best for me. But… are they expensive? I don't have much money saved up. And I don’t want to be poked and prodded too much. I get tired easily, you know. Is the coughing… dangerous? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Pavlovic, and it’s important you feel comfortable. The X-ray will simply give us a picture of your lungs to rule out any other conditions like pneumonia or other structural issues. It’s non-invasive, doesn't involve any poking or prodding, and is very quick. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube, and it helps us measure how well your lungs are working. It's also non-invasive, but does require some effort. As for the cost, let me speak to the front desk and see what your options are. We can explore possible financial assistance programs, and I’ll only recommend what's absolutely necessary. The coughing itself isn’t necessarily dangerous right now, but it's important to figure out the cause of it. Chronic bronchitis can lead to more serious problems down the line if it’s not managed, which is why we need to investigate. It’s better to be proactive, and catch any potential issues early. Do you feel any chest pain or shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not at rest, anyway. Maybe a little when I… try to lift something heavy. But I don’t lift heavy things anymore. Mostly just… sit. And read. Sometimes watch television. Shortness of breath… not really. Unless I try to climb the stairs. But like I said, I don't do stairs. Financial assistance… that would be good. My daughter, she works hard, but money is tight. I don't want to be a burden. If it's just breathing into a tube, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And no poking. No poking is good. Is it cold? I get cold easily.
DOCTOR: No poking at all, I promise. And it shouldn't be cold; we'll make sure you’re comfortable. The breathing test shouldn't take too long – about 15-20 minutes. Alright. Let’s start with the chest X-ray. I’ll write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They’re very good there. And I’ll have the front desk schedule the pulmonary function test for you as well. We can also talk about some options for managing the cough in the meantime – like staying hydrated and avoiding irritants. Would you like me to call your daughter to let her know what we’ve discussed and get her input?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. She's always better at remembering things. And she can ask the questions I forget. Her name is May… May Pavlovic. She’s a good daughter. And… thank you, Doctor. For not… making fun of me. For being patient. It's just… hard to remember everything these days. And I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not a bother, Mr. Pavlovic. That's what I’m here for. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it’s good you have May to help. Let me just pull up her number… and I’ll give her a call. While I’m doing that, is there anything else on your mind?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please tell her not to worry too much. I’m old, Doctor. Things… break down when you’re old. It’s just… the coughing is annoying. And I want to be able to sit and read without hacking all the time. And thank you again. For being so kind. It’s… nice to have someone listen.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. I understand completely. And I will definitely let May know we’ll take things one step at a time. I’m glad I could listen. “Hello, May Pavlovic?
