DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it hurts. A lot. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Sorted quickly,” alright. Back pain is… common. But let’s get some details. Can you tell me where exactly is the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… lower back, mostly. Right in the small of my back. And it goes down my left leg sometimes. Not always, but when it does, it feels like… pins and needles. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Pins and needles, alright. Radiating pain is… helpful information. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It started… maybe six weeks ago? I think. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little ache after work. But it’s gotten worse each week, especially the pain in my leg. It’s making it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, progressively worsening… And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: I… erect fences. It's heavy work. Lots of lifting and bending and… well, you can imagine. It’s not easy, but it’s what I do. It's all I've done for a long time.
DOCTOR: Erecting fences... yes, that explains a few things. Do you recall anything specific that might have triggered the initial pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not really. Just… woke up one morning feeling it. It wasn’t after a particularly hard day, or anything. I just… felt it. I figured it would go away. I should have come sooner, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Right now? Hmm… I'd say a seven. It's a constant ache, and if I move wrong… it shoots up to an eight, maybe even a nine. It’s… distracting.
DOCTOR: Seven to nine… alright. And does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Not much, honestly. Sitting sometimes helps a little, but even that gets uncomfortable after a while. I’ve tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ones you take for arthritis, but they don't do much good. Mostly just upset my stomach.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications… right. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just need to check your range of motion and reflexes. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Just… be gentle, please. It hurts to bend.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as careful as possible. First, I’m going to have you bend forward and try to touch your toes. Only go as far as you comfortably can. Don’t push yourself. Okay, stop there. I see. Now, let’s try bending backwards… gently. Alright. Now I'm going to palpate your lower back to check for tenderness and muscle spasm. Tell me if anything is particularly painful. Hmm. Tenderness present at L4-L5. Muscle spasm palpable. Now, let's check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… tender right there. Yes, that’s where it hurts the most. That makes my leg jump a little. It's… uncomfortable. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness at L4-L5, muscle spasm, and positive reflex response… It’s likely you have a nerve impingement or a herniated disc, Ms. Reihner. But we need to confirm that with imaging. I’m going to order an MRI of your lower back. That will give us a clear picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory. Try to avoid any heavy lifting or bending as much as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. MRI… muscle relaxant… avoid lifting. But… I need to work. Fences don't build themselves. Is there… anything else I can do? Will the medicine let me work, at least a little? I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, I understand your concerns. But continuing to work in your current condition will only worsen the problem, potentially leading to more serious complications. The muscle relaxant will help with the pain and spasm, but it will cause drowsiness. And the anti-inflammatory takes time to work. I’m going to recommend you take a leave of absence from work until we have the results of the MRI and can develop a proper treatment plan. Prolonging this will only make things worse, and frankly, you risk permanent damage. Do you have any family or friends who can assist you during this time?
PATIENT: No. Not really. My husband… he passed a few years back. I've been on my own since then. I don't have anyone to help with bills, or… anything. A leave of absence… that means no money. Is there any way to… speed things up? I can't afford to be out of work for long. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t understand all this talk of ‘herniated discs’ and ‘nerve impingements’. Will this fix it? Can you fix it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, I understand your situation is… challenging. But I need to be clear: I can't ‘fix’ it without knowing the extent of the damage. The MRI is crucial. And rushing this process will not benefit you. I can prescribe you a stronger pain reliever to help manage the discomfort while we wait for the results. But that's a temporary solution. I also want you to contact your insurance company to inquire about disability benefits. Frankly, given your description, you may be eligible. I’m going to refer you to a specialist, a neurosurgeon, Dr. Evans. He's excellent. He can evaluate the MRI results and discuss all your treatment options, including potential surgery. I will have my nurse schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Not right now. Surgery… that sounds… frightening. But… I suppose I need to know what my options are. And disability… I’ll try. I don't know where to start, but I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. I… I think that’s all for now. I just want this pain to stop. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. My nurse will be in shortly to discuss the prescriptions and schedule the appointment with Dr. Evans. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. We'll figure this out. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
