DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it's my ears, actually. They've been ringing. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's… annoying, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears… that’s what we call tinnitus. And you said it's been happening for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's really loud, other times I barely notice it. It’s hard to explain. It's like… a high-pitched whine, mostly. Though sometimes it sounds different. I just want it to stop, you know? I’m trying to get back to work, and it’s making it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks, comes and goes, varying pitch… that’s helpful. And it's impacting your concentration at work. That's definitely something we need to address. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really, not that I've noticed. I work as a waiter, so it's pretty loud in the restaurant sometimes, but it happens even when it's quiet. I thought maybe it was the noise at work, but… it doesn’t seem to be just that. Maybe stress? I got divorced a while back, so things have been a bit hectic.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially stress related, despite also happening in quiet environments. You mentioned a recent divorce… I appreciate you sharing that. Life changes can definitely contribute to things like this. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. Besides the ringing, have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or anything like that. My hearing seems okay, I think. I can still hear everything normally. Sometimes my ears feel a little… blocked, maybe? But not always. It's hard to describe. It’s just… the ringing is the main thing. It’s driving me crazy. I just want to know if there’s something wrong, and if you can fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, hearing seems normal, occasional feeling of fullness. We'll definitely try to figure out what's causing the ringing. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t really taken anything regularly for years, except maybe the occasional painkiller for a headache. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I've got private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the insurance. And that’s good to hear you’re generally healthy. Alright. Now, let's do a quick examination of your ears. It'll just involve looking inside with a scope, and a simple hearing test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start with a look in your ears. This might be a little uncomfortable for a moment. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Okay… both ear canals appear clear. There’s no visible wax buildup or signs of infection. The eardrums look normal as well. Now, let’s do the tuning fork test. This checks how well sound travels through your middle ear. Okay, the Weber test… and now the Rinne test. The results are… subtle. The Rinne test is within normal limits. The Weber test is midline, which isn't indicative of any significant conductive hearing loss. So, there doesn't appear to be a blockage or structural issue causing the ringing.
PATIENT: Okay… so what does that mean? Is it something inside my head, then? I’m getting a bit worried now. I just want to be able to hear normally again. And I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried. Let’s not jump to conclusions. A normal examination doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. In many cases – especially when there’s no hearing loss or other obvious cause – tinnitus is related to the way the brain processes sound. Think of it like the brain is “filling in” phantom sounds. It could also be related to stress, as you mentioned, or even exposure to loud noises over time. In many cases, it resolves on its own, or with simple management strategies. To get a better idea, and rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a simple audiogram – a hearing test done by an audiologist. That'll give us a more detailed picture of your hearing across different frequencies. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An audiogram… yeah, okay. That sounds… thorough. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes. I’m just… tired of the ringing. It’s like a constant buzz in the background. Will the audiologist be here at the clinic? Or do I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Good. The audiologist isn’t here at the clinic directly, but we have a referral to a very good one nearby, Dr. Elara Vance. I’ll print out a referral form for you. The office is just a short drive away, and they usually have appointments available within a week. In the meantime, while we wait for the results of the audiogram, we can discuss some strategies to manage the tinnitus. Things like avoiding loud noises, reducing stress, and using white noise can sometimes provide relief. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on managing tinnitus?
PATIENT: Yeah, resources would be great. Anything to help. And thanks for the referral. Hopefully, they can figure out what’s going on. I really appreciate you not dismissing it. It’s just… annoying. And I need to work. Is there anything I should do before the appointment with the audiologist? Like, should I avoid anything specific?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. It’s important to me that your concerns are taken seriously. Before your appointment with Dr. Vance, I’d recommend avoiding exposure to very loud noises if possible. Also, try to get a good night’s sleep, and reduce your stress levels. It might also be helpful to keep a log of when the ringing is worse – what you’re doing, where you are, how stressed you are – that can be helpful information for the audiologist. I'll also write a note on the referral form about your recent divorce, as stress is a likely factor. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful. I’ll go ahead and schedule the appointment with the audiologist. Hopefully, they can give me some answers. I guess I’ll just try to avoid loud noises and relax… if I can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I hope you find some relief soon. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll follow up with you after you see Dr. Vance. Have a good day, and take care.
