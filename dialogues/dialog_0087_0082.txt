DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. I think… travel? My wife… she would always make the appointments. I work with the planes, you know? Building them. I don't… really remember where we were going. Something hot, I think. She liked the sun. It was… before. Before everything.
DOCTOR: I understand this is a difficult time, Mr. Tayar. It’s perfectly alright if you’re having trouble recalling details. We can take things slowly. Just tell me what you do remember, and we’ll go from there. You mentioned travel… and that your wife usually handled appointments. Can you tell me approximately when this travel occurred, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Before the… the big rains. That was… last year, I think? Maybe spring? She booked everything in March, usually. We… we had the tickets and everything. Small bags, just for a week or two. Not a long trip. She liked the beaches. Lots of sun. I don't… I don't know what month, exactly. Just… before.
DOCTOR: Okay, before the big rains in spring of last year. That gives us a starting point. And you mentioned tickets and small bags for a week or two. Do you recall where you were traveling to, even a general region?
PATIENT: Ugh. She always picked. Somewhere… far. Island, maybe? Lots of palm trees. Not… Europe. She didn't like the cold. Always said it was bad for her… her bones. Somewhere… warm. Very warm. I think… maybe south? Like… where everything is… sandy? I don't… I just followed her. She did all the thinking. I fixed the planes. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Tayar. You’re doing very well. It sounds like you and your wife enjoyed warm, tropical destinations. We’re trying to piece together when you might have been exposed to something that's causing your current symptoms, so any details, even small ones, are important. Before we go further, could you describe what symptoms are bringing you in today?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh. Right. I… I get tired. Very tired. And my stomach… it doesn't like things. Everything feels… wrong. And a fever, sometimes. Not a big one, but… warm. Like a little fire inside. And… aches. All over. Like I’ve been… working too hard, but I haven't been. Not really. Just… tired and warm and achy. That’s it, I think. It started… after I came back. From… wherever.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, gastrointestinal upset, intermittent fever, and body aches, starting after your return from travel. Can you tell me more about the gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Ugh. Just… bad. Everything goes right through. And… hurts. Lots of cramping. And… sometimes I just… feel sick. Like I’m going to… you know. It started a few days after I got home. I thought it was just… the food. But it hasn't gone away. It’s… annoying. I can't eat much, either. Makes it worse. Like a little fire in my belly. It's not… pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very unpleasant. We need to rule out a few possibilities. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Blood…? Uh. No. Not that I've seen. Just… soft. Everything is just… soft. And… dark. Not bright. Like… old coffee. That’s the color. Dark and… soft. I haven't really… looked closely, to be honest. I just… try to get it over with. It's embarrassing. And… upsetting. Makes me feel weak. Even weaker. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Tayar. Thank you for being so open with me. Dark, soft stools are certainly something we need to investigate. Now, let’s talk about the fever. Do you know what your temperature has been, or does it just feel warm to the touch?
PATIENT: Just warm. Like a little fire. I don't… own a thermometer. My wife… she always took it. She was good with things like that. I just… feel hot. Sometimes at night. And… sweaty. Just a little. Not… soaking wet. Just… warm and… bothered. It doesn't last long. Maybe an hour or two. Then it’s gone. But it comes back. A little fire. Is that… bad? I don't want to be sick. I just want to fix the planes. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent low-grade fever, fatigue, gastrointestinal upset with dark, soft stools. We'll need to do a physical exam and some lab work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Lab work…? More poking and prodding? My wife… she didn’t like the needles. I don’t either. But… if you think it's important. I just want to feel better. So… yes. Fine. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick, please? And… tell me what’s wrong, okay? Don’t just give me… fancy words. I won’t understand. Just… tell me. Plainly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. I will explain everything in plain language. And I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll examine your abdomen. After that, we'll take a small blood sample. It’s routine, and it will help us rule out some potential causes for your symptoms. Deep breaths, please. I'm listening now… everything sounds clear. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Just… tired. Hard to breathe sometimes, but that's just… the tiredness. Always tired. Even when I sleep. Like a weight on my chest. But no pain. Just… heavy. And warm. Everything is always warm. Even my hands. Is that… normal? My wife… she always said I was cold. But now… warm. Too warm. Maybe that’s the problem. Being too warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen now. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ugh. Here… a little. Not sharp. Just… achy. Like… a dull ache. All over. But here… a little worse. Just… a pressure. Like… something is pushing. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And… gassy. Lots of gas. Maybe that’s why it’s uncomfortable. I… I ate something bad, maybe? Before I came home. Some street food, I think. My wife… she didn’t like street food. She always said it was dangerous. Maybe she was right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to tap on your abdomen now. Just to check for any fluid or abnormalities. It sounds a little… full. Not dramatically so, but more than I'd expect. Do you experience any bloating or a feeling of fullness even after eating small amounts?
PATIENT: Bloating…? Yes. Always bloated. Like… a balloon. Especially at night. After I eat… even a little bit. I feel… stuffed. Like I can't move. And… gassy. Lots of gas. Makes me feel… ashamed. I try not to… you know. But it happens. And… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. My wife… she always said I had a delicate stomach. Maybe that’s the problem. A delicate stomach. And too much gas. And… tiredness. It’s all mixed up. I just want to fix the planes. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tayar. Based on the physical exam and what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing significant gastrointestinal symptoms – fatigue, fever, abdominal discomfort, bloating, and changes in your bowel habits. We need to run some tests to determine the exact cause, but it's possible you may have contracted an infection during your travels. I'm going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a stool sample analysis. The CBC will check for signs of infection, the CMP will assess your organ function, and the stool analysis will help us identify any parasites or bacteria. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood, and I’ll give you a container to collect a stool sample. I will explain everything. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh. More poking and prodding? And… collecting… that? My wife… she always did it. I… I don’t want to. But… if you think it’s important. Okay. Fine. Do what you need to do. Just… tell me what it all means. Plainly. No fancy words. And… be quick, please? It makes me… nervous. Collecting that. Very nervous. And… the needles. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mr. Tayar. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood draw will be quick, and the lab technician is very experienced. As for the stool sample, it's a simple process. I’ll provide you with a container and detailed instructions. You’ll collect a small amount of stool after your next bowel movement, and then we'll send it to the lab for analysis. I promise I will explain all the results in plain language, without any fancy medical jargon. We’ll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, I recommend you stay well-hydrated and eat small, bland meals. Avoid anything spicy or greasy. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, high fever, or bloody stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Hydrated… yes. I drink water. Bland… what does that mean? No spices? No… curry? My wife… she liked curry. A little spicy. Okay. No curry. And… no emergency room. I don't want to go to the emergency room. Just… fix the problem. That’s all. Ugh. Questions…? Hmm. Will it be… expensive? The tests? My wife… she handled the money. I… I don't know how much I have. Will it be a lot? That’s my question. Will it be a lot of money?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Mr. Tayar. The cost of the tests will depend on your insurance coverage. I will have our billing department contact you directly to provide you with an estimate. They can also assist you with any financial concerns you may have. I'm sending a request to billing now to contact you as soon as possible. They are very helpful and can work with you to determine your out-of-pocket expenses. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and finding out what’s going on. I will also provide you with a prescription for an anti-nausea medication to help with the stomach upset. It’s a low dose, and should help you feel a little more comfortable. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh. No. Not that I know of. My wife… she always asked. She always knew. I just… took what she gave me. No allergies. But… I get dizzy sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Is that… an allergy? No. Just… dizzy. Sometimes. Not often. No allergies. I promise. No allergies. Just dizzy. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but occasional dizziness upon standing. That’s good to know. It doesn’t sound like an allergy, but we’ll keep that in mind. Here is the prescription for the anti-nausea medication. You can fill it at any pharmacy. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. I will also give you the container and instructions for the stool sample. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is… a lot. Blood and… that. And now a prescription. I just want to feel better. That’s all. I… I don’t think so. No more questions. Just… let’s get it over with. Quickly, please? And… explain everything. Plainly. No fancy words. Just… tell me what’s wrong. When you know. Okay? Just… let’s get it over with. I want to fix the planes. That’s all. That's all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tayar. You just want to feel better and get back to work. And I promise, I will do everything I can to help you. I will explain everything in plain language, and I won't use any fancy medical jargon. The lab technician will be in shortly, and they’ll take care of the blood draw. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this together. .
PATIENT: .
