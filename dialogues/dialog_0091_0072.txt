DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s my memory. It’s… not what it used to be, and it's starting to worry me a little. I just feel like I’m forgetting things more and more often.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly wise to address concerns about memory changes, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good you're being proactive. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe some of the things you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not huge things, like appointments necessarily… though I did almost miss my dentist last month. Mostly it's… names. I’ll be talking to someone and the name just… slips away. And little things, like where I put my keys, or if I took my vitamins. It’s frustrating, you know? Like it’s right there, on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can appreciate how frustrating that must be. It's helpful to have specific examples. So, names are a primary concern, along with misplacing items and occasionally forgetting if you've completed tasks like taking your vitamins. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It's hard to pinpoint exactly… I think it’s been gradually getting worse over the last… six months, maybe? It started slowly, just being a little more forgetful than usual, but it feels like it’s picked up speed recently. It’s definitely more noticeable now than it was back in February.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Six months of gradual worsening, with a more noticeable increase recently, is important information. Ms. Heidenthal, have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. Not really… I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I just figured that was from work, honestly. I’m a dentist, so it can be a long day on your feet. I haven’t noticed anything major, no. I’m still… me, I think. Still enjoy my hobbies, still see my friends… everything feels pretty normal besides the forgetting.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear that you haven't noticed any other significant changes in your overall functioning or personality. Increased fatigue could be relevant, but as you mentioned, it’s understandable given your profession. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I do have Medicare, as I’m getting on in years, haha. No major illnesses, no chronic conditions… just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. And I take a daily multivitamin, like I mentioned before. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful information. The appendectomy is good to know for your record, and I appreciate you mentioning the Medicare coverage. The daily multivitamin is noted as well. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. I get my checkups regularly, and they've never told me anything like that. Blood pressure is always a little high at the doctor’s office, just because I’m nervous, but it’s always okay when I check it at home. Everything’s usually pretty normal, honestly. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Not a lot of junk food.
DOCTOR: That's reassuring. Regular checkups and normal results are excellent. We can always review those records if you’d like. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she… well, she was a bit confused towards the end. We just thought it was old age, really. She didn’t really know anyone towards the end, but we never had her officially diagnosed with anything. My mother always said she just “lost her marbles,” but that was just her way of talking. No one else that I know of, though. My father’s side of the family was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. A history of confusion in your grandmother, even without a formal diagnosis, is something we should keep in mind. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never really been interested in any of that, honestly. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's about it. And I definitely don't smoke or do any drugs. I try to stay healthy, as I said before. Is that… good? I hope that's good. I’m not sure what you’re looking for, exactly.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Heidenthal. A healthy lifestyle with limited alcohol consumption is very positive. It’s good you prioritize your well-being. Now, I'd like to ask about any recent changes in your life that might be causing stress or anxiety. Have you experienced any major life events, such as a loss, a relocation, or a significant change in your work situation?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, no. Work’s been… the same old busy. No major changes there. My practice is doing well, thankfully. I’m single, never married, so no changes on that front either. I see my friends regularly, we go out for dinner, things like that. No big losses, no relocations… honestly, it’s been pretty… stable. Which is maybe why this memory thing is so worrying, you know? It’s not like I’m stressed about anything. Is that… useful? I feel like I'm not giving you anything exciting to work with.
DOCTOR: You’re providing very useful information, Ms. Heidenthal. It's helpful to know that your life has been relatively stable. The fact that this memory issue is occurring without any obvious stressors makes it even more important to investigate. Now, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks to evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental functions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I mean, I'm already here, and if it helps figure out what’s going on, then absolutely. I'm a little nervous, to be honest, but… let’s get it over with. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable to be a bit nervous. It’s a simple assessment, nothing to worry about. First, could you please tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… today is… August… the second. 2025. Is that right? I think so. It's August 2nd, 2025. I’m pretty sure. Sometimes the days just… blur together.
DOCTOR: That’s correct. August 2nd, 2025. Knowing the date is good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s easy. We’re in… let me think. We’re in… well, I work downtown, so… is it okay if I say the name of the neighborhood? We're in the Financial District! Yes, that’s right. I’m a dentist here, so I should know where I am!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely correct. Knowing your location is good. Now, I'm going to say three words. Please repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I'll try my best. I hope I remember them! This is a little nerve-wracking, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Um… okay. Let me see… apple… table… penny. Is that right? Apple, table, penny. I think I got them. Hopefully. Is that what you wanted? I feel like my mind is already forgetting them! It's awful.
DOCTOR: That is correct. Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to subtract 7 from 100. And then subtract 7 from that answer, and continue subtracting 7 five times. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Okay. Um… 100 minus 7 is… 93. Okay, 93 minus 7 is… 86. Let me see… 86 minus 7 is… 79. Okay, 79 minus 7 is… 72. 72 minus 7 is… 65. And finally… 65 minus 7 is… 58. Is that right? I had to really concentrate on that. It's harder than it sounds! I used my fingers a little. I hope I didn’t mess it up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, and you are correct! You did very well. Now, I’m going to ask you to copy this simple drawing for me. Please take your time and do your best.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That looks… complicated. Um… alright, let me see… This is harder than it looks! I’m not very good at drawing, I’m a dentist, not an artist! It's... not going to be very good. Is that good enough? I'm sorry, it's a bit wonky.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Heidenthal. This isn't an art test, just a way to assess certain cognitive functions. You did your best, and that’s what matters. Now, let's move on to a simple recall test. I'm going to read you a short list of three items. Please repeat them back to me immediately. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Please read the list. I hope I can remember them this time. My memory feels so unreliable today! It's making me anxious, to be honest. I'm sorry if I seem flustered.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Take your time, and don’t worry about being perfect. The three items are: chair, socks, river.
PATIENT: Okay. Um… chair… socks… river. Chair, socks, river. I think I got them. Are those right? I said them right after you, didn't I? Please tell me if I messed it up. I feel like I'm failing a test! It's awful.
DOCTOR: You are correct. Good. Now, I'm going to ask you to name as many animals as you can in one minute. I will start timing as soon as you say your first animal. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… one minute? That's… pressure. Okay. Uh… dog! Cat! …horse! …lion! …tiger! …elephant… uh… bear! …wolf… monkey… kangaroo… Is that enough? My mind is blanking! It's so hard when you're thinking about remembering! Please tell me when the minute is up. I’m really stressed now!
DOCTOR: Okay, time’s up. You named eight animals, which is a reasonable number. Now, let’s switch gears. Can you tell me what year it currently is?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it’s… 2025. Right? 2025. Is that right? I'm so worried I’m going to mess something simple up. It feels like my brain is foggy today. Is this test telling you something bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly fine, Ms. Heidenthal. You are correct; it is 2025. This test is not about “passing” or “failing”, it’s about gathering information. Okay. Now, can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… that’s… I always have trouble remembering names… Let me think… Is it… Biden? Yes! Joe Biden. Is that right? Please tell me if I’m wrong. I’m so worried about this. It’s just names, though, right? I’m good at my job! I just can’t seem to remember things sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are correct. It is Joe Biden. Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. That concludes the brief cognitive assessment. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Is that it? So… what does this mean? What did I do wrong? Am I… losing my mind? Please tell me something. I’m really scared now. I’ve been so worried about this, and now I’m even more anxious. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Ms. Heidenthal, and it's good you're expressing your concerns. Please know that this assessment doesn't automatically mean anything is seriously wrong. The results showed some areas where you performed well, and some areas where you had some difficulty, particularly with recall and some aspects of concentration. It’s important to remember that cognitive tests are just one piece of the puzzle. There are many factors that can influence performance, including stress, fatigue, and normal age-related changes. Based on these initial findings, I believe further investigation is warranted to determine the cause of your memory concerns. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues, that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also recommend a structural MRI of the brain to rule out any anatomical causes. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. They will be able to perform additional testing and provide a more detailed assessment of your cognitive function. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s… a lot. Blood work, an MRI… a neurologist… It sounds serious. I was hoping it was just stress or something. Is it… is it possible it could be something like… Alzheimer’s? I’ve heard about that, and my grandmother… she was a bit confused towards the end. I guess… yes, I have questions. What kind of blood work? And what will the MRI show? And what does a neurologist do, exactly? I’m just… really scared, Doctor. I don't want to lose my memory. I love my job, and I love my life. Please tell me it’s not something terrible.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel scared, Ms. Heidenthal. It's good you're asking these questions. It's important to address your concerns directly. Let's take things one step at a time. The blood work will be a standard panel to check for common deficiencies, like vitamin B12 and folate, and to assess your thyroid function, kidney function, and liver function. These can sometimes cause cognitive symptoms. The MRI will provide a detailed image of your brain, allowing us to look for any structural abnormalities, such as strokes, tumors, or shrinkage in certain areas of the brain. It's a non-invasive procedure, meaning it doesn't involve any surgery. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system, which includes the brain. They will perform a more in-depth neurological examination and may order additional tests, such as an EEG or neuropsychological testing . Now, regarding your concern about Alzheimer's disease, it is possible, but it is far too early to make any definitive conclusions. The symptoms you’ve described are not specific to Alzheimer’s disease and can be caused by many other factors. Many people experience memory problems that are due to stress, anxiety, or normal age-related changes. The testing we're ordering is to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I want to assure you that we will work together to figure out what's going on and develop a plan to address your concerns. We're not jumping to any conclusions. We are gathering information to make an informed diagnosis. Would you like me to explain anything further at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that makes a little more sense. So it's just gathering information. Not… a death sentence. Thank you. What about the results? How long will it take to get them? And what happens after the tests? Will I have to… take medication? Or… will I need someone to take care of me? I’m sorry. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed. I’ve never been through anything like this before. I just want to know what’s happening. And what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Heidenthal. It's perfectly normal to be anxious when facing uncertainty. Let's address your questions. The blood work results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. The MRI will take a bit longer, usually 5-7 business days, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. After we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. At that point, we can determine the next steps. The treatment plan will depend on the cause of your symptoms. If the tests reveal a vitamin deficiency or other underlying medical condition, we can address that with medication or lifestyle changes. If the results are inconclusive, or if we suspect a more complex cognitive disorder, we will discuss further testing and treatment options with the neurologist. Regarding medication, it's too early to say whether that will be necessary. Many cognitive disorders can be managed with non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive therapy, exercise, and social engagement. And finally, regarding needing someone to take care of you, that is also something we don't know at this point. Many people with cognitive disorders are able to maintain their independence with the help of support services and family members. We will assess your needs and develop a plan to help you maintain your quality of life. I want to assure you that you are not alone in this. I will be here to support you every step of the way. We will work together to figure out what's going on and develop a plan to help you live your life to the fullest. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on cognitive health and support services?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I think knowing where to find information would make me feel a little less scared. And maybe a little less… alone. Thank you, Doctor Delacour. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I still feel anxious, but… a little better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It's my pleasure to help. Here are some resources that may be helpful. This brochure includes contact information for these organizations, as well as websites with additional information on cognitive health. I will also have my nurse email you a list of local neurologists who are accepting new patients. I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to discuss the results of your tests. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, two weeks sounds good. That gives me time to… process everything, and maybe do some research. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I think… I think I’m okay for now. I just want to get home and… relax.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Heidenthal. Please take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I will see you in two weeks. Have a good day.
