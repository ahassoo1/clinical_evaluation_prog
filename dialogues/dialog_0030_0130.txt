DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my family. Lots of… trouble with hearts, you see. My mother, my brother… both had problems. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I get a little worried, you know? Just want some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. Family history is very important, and it’s wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a concern like heart issues. Let’s gather some information, and we can assess your risk and determine if any further testing is needed. To start, could you tell me a little more about the heart problems your mother and brother experienced?
PATIENT: My mother… she had trouble breathing mostly. Always tired. Then one day… just stopped. They said it was her heart, something about… not pumping right. My brother, he had chest pain. Lots of it. He had… a thing put in. A little metal thing. Helped for a while, but he… he didn’t live long after that. I don’t know much about what exactly happened, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds very difficult for you and your family, Mr. Schwer. It’s understandable that you’d be concerned. And you mentioned you’ve been feeling worried. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms yourself – any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or unusual fatigue?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not yet. That’s why I came. I feel… okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m an old man, you know? I work hard, selling things… travels a lot. Could just be the work. I just don’t want to wait until something happens, like with them.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Mr. Schwer. It’s always better to be cautious. Alright. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, just to get a clearer picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… what was it? Blood… pressure? I think the doctor checked it once, a long time ago. Said it was a little high, but told me to… watch the salt. I try to. Not always good at it, though. Cholesterol? No, I don't think so. Never heard of it, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood, and high levels can increase your risk of heart disease. We can certainly check both your blood pressure and cholesterol today if you’d like. Besides the blood pressure check you recall, have you had any other significant medical problems, been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I broke my leg once, when I was a boy. Fell off a horse. Had to have it… set. And I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. Nothing else I can think of, really. Just the usual… colds and flus. I’m a pretty healthy man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… something for my knees. They ache sometimes. It’s a little pill, I get it from the drugstore. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take something for that too. Just when I really can’t sleep, though. Not every night. I can’t remember what they’re called… old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Schwer. It's common to forget names when you're taking multiple medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. I like food too much to worry about allergies!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no. Never smoked. Tried it once, when I was young, but didn’t like it. Made me cough. My father smoked, and he always smelled… bad. I didn’t want to be like that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Schwer. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little beer sometimes. With dinner. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing fancy. Just… to relax. I don’t drink to get drunk or anything. It’s just… a habit, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? Well… I walk a lot at work. Selling things… you’re on your feet all day. Does that count? I don’t go to a gym or anything. I’m too old for that!
DOCTOR: That definitely counts, Mr. Schwer! Being on your feet all day is good activity. Alright, now that we have a better understanding of your history, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t poke too hard, okay? My bones are a little… creaky.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Schwer. I'll be gentle. If you could please have a seat here, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then check your blood pressure and pulse. We'll also take a quick look at your reflexes and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Just… let me know if you’re going to be cold, okay? Old men get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. I'll make sure to keep you comfortable. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but it's something we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s slightly elevated. And your pulse is 76 and regular. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning. Do you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… feels a little strange, that’s all. A murmur, you say? Is that bad? And the blood pressure… is that the high thing you mentioned earlier? It sounds… worrying.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you don't feel any pain, Mr. Schwer. A murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes when it’s beating. Many murmurs are harmless, but it's important to find out what's causing it, just to be sure. And yes, 142/88 is a little higher than we’d like. It's not an emergency, but it does mean we need to investigate further and potentially manage your blood pressure. To get a better understanding of your heart, I recommend an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity. We should also do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG… and blood work. Sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I trust you. I just want to know I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, you know? So, yes, let’s do whatever you think is necessary. When can we do these things?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Schwer. I completely understand wanting to be proactive and avoid surprises. We can do the EKG right here in the office today. It’s quick and painless. And then I’ll give you a lab order for the blood work, which you can get done at the lab across the hall. They don’t require an appointment, and it usually takes about 30 minutes. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address your slightly elevated blood pressure and investigate the murmur. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. Across the hall, you say? Good. I can walk. And then we’ll talk about the results. Okay. Let’s do it. Do I need to… fast for the blood work? Like, not eat anything before? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schwer! Yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except water, during that time. Since it’s already the afternoon, you could have a light dinner tonight and then nothing until after you get the blood work done tomorrow morning. Here, I’ve written down the instructions, just so you have them. And the lab technician will remind you as well. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Eight to twelve hours… okay, I can manage that. Just no coffee in the morning? That’s the hardest part. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. And yes, no coffee until after the blood work. Alright. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the EKG. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you today. .
