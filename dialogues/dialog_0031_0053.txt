DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, you see. I’ve been having trouble…going to the bathroom. It just takes me a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I get everything out, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination. Could you tell me a bit more about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe six months ago? It wasn't bad at first, just a little slower. But these last couple of months, it’s gotten worse. I remember it being around the time of the spring rains… does that matter? I have a good memory for dates, you see.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Yadao. Knowing when it started is very useful. And yes, sometimes changes in the weather can affect certain conditions, though it's not always a direct link. So, it's been progressively worsening over the last six months, with a noticeable increase in the last couple of months. When you say it takes you a long time, could you estimate how long it typically takes you to start urinating, and how long it takes to finish?
PATIENT: Well… it used to be just a moment, you know? Quick as you please. Now… now it can be a good five, ten minutes, easy. Just standing there, waiting. And pushing. It's not painful, exactly, just… effort. I have to really concentrate. And sometimes I feel like I still have to go back, even after I’ve been. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, really.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss, Ms. Yadao, but it’s important for me to have a clear picture of what you’re experiencing to provide the best care. So thank you for sharing. You mentioned it takes five to ten minutes, and you sometimes feel the need to return shortly after. Do you find you're straining to urinate, or is it more of a slow, weak stream?
PATIENT: It’s a slow stream, definitely. And yes, I do have to push a little, like I’m… well, like I’m helping it along. Not hard pushing, but I have to think about it, you know? I can't just relax and let it happen like I used to. It’s… different. Very different. I don’t have any pain, though. Just the waiting and the pushing and the feeling of not being quite empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slow stream requiring effort to initiate and complete, and a sensation of incomplete emptying, without pain. Do you notice any urgency to urinate – a sudden, strong need to go?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's one thing that isn’t happening. I don’t suddenly have to rush, or anything like that. It's more… a gradual awareness that I need to go, and then the trouble getting it going. I can usually wait a little while if I need to, without feeling panicked. It's not like that at all. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things, thank you. So, no urgency. No pain. Gradual onset of needing to go, and then difficulty with initiation and completion, and a sense of incomplete emptying. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years. And I had a little bit of high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for a long time now. Just a small dose, Doctor Rakosky. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was in my forties. That was a long time ago, though. Other than that, I’m fairly healthy, for my age. I've always been a strong woman, you know? Do you need to know about any allergies?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Ms. Yadao. Thank you. Gallbladder removal, history of high blood pressure controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy in the past. And no known allergies, that’s good. Do you currently take any medications, other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just one. I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were a bit low during my annual checkup last year. It's just a small tablet, once a day. And… that’s it. Really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. I prefer to stay natural, you know? Everything in moderation.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Vitamin D supplement, and no other medications. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope, and a gentle external exam of your abdomen and pelvic area. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. As long as it’s not too…invasive. I trust your judgement, of course. I suppose it's necessary. Just be gentle, please. My skin is a bit sensitive these days. And I'm a little chilly. Do I need to take anything off?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We will keep it as comfortable as possible. And yes, I apologize for the room temperature. I will see if we can adjust the thermostat. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor Rakosky. I’m ready when you are. Just… take your time. And let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. I will start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your bowel sounds are present and normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. I'll also be checking your lower abdomen externally. I’m not detecting any significant tenderness or masses in your abdomen. Your external pelvic exam is also unremarkable. I do note a slight hesitancy upon initial palpation of the suprapubic area, but no acute pain. Alright, Ms. Yadao. You can sit up now, whenever you are ready. That concludes the physical exam portion.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, that wasn't too bad. What did you find, Doctor Rakosky? Is it something serious? You mentioned a hesitancy… what does that mean? I hope it's nothing too worrisome. I’ve always been a nervous sort, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be nervous, Ms. Yadao. The hesitancy I noted simply means there was a slight resistance when I initially pressed on the area above your pubic bone. It’s a subtle finding, and not necessarily indicative of anything serious. Based on your history and the physical exam, the most likely cause of your symptoms is a degree of bladder outlet obstruction, potentially related to age-related changes in the bladder and urethra, or possibly a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles. However, to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test. The urinalysis will check for any signs of infection, and the post-void residual volume test will measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. A urinalysis, I understand, but what about the other thing? Measuring what's left in my bladder… how does that work? And will it be uncomfortable? I really don't like anything poking around in there, you know. I'm a bit sensitive, as I mentioned. But if it's necessary… I suppose I can do it. As long as you explain everything clearly. And gently, please.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Yadao. It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious about it. The post-void residual volume test is relatively simple and non-invasive. After you urinate, we’ll use a small, handheld ultrasound device to gently scan your lower abdomen. It doesn’t involve any poking or insertion of instruments. The ultrasound waves will allow us to estimate the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s similar to what they do during pregnancy to check the baby. It’s painless and takes only a few minutes. We'll collect the urine sample first, and then do the scan. Would you like me to explain the process in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… less frightening than I imagined. No poking, you say? And it’s like a pregnancy scan? My sister had those done, and she said it was painless. So, I suppose I can agree to that. A urine sample and a scan. Yes. But what if something is wrong? What if it's something serious? You mentioned something about the bladder… and muscles… What are the possibilities, Doctor? I like to be prepared, you know. Even if it's bad news. Better to know what I'm facing.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Ms. Yadao. It’s always best to be informed. The possibilities range from relatively minor issues to more complex ones. The most common causes of symptoms like yours include: Age-related changes: As we age, the bladder muscles can weaken, and the urethra can narrow, making it harder to empty the bladder completely. Pelvic floor dysfunction: Weakening or dysfunction of the pelvic floor muscles can also contribute to difficulty with urination. Urinary Tract Infection : Although you don’t have any typical UTI symptoms, it’s always important to rule it out. Bladder outlet obstruction: This can be caused by an enlarged prostate in men, but in women it's often related to anatomical factors or previous surgeries. Less commonly: More serious conditions like bladder stones or even bladder cancer could cause similar symptoms. That's why we're doing the tests. The urinalysis and post-void residual volume test will help me narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. If the tests reveal any abnormalities, we may need to consider further investigations, such as a cystoscopy or urodynamic studies . But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. The tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to write out these possibilities for you to take home?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor Rakosky. That would be very helpful. Having it written down will ease my mind, even if it's just a little. It's good to know what to expect, you know? And it’s good of you to explain everything so clearly. Alright. So, a urine sample and the scan. And then we'll see what happens. Do I need to do anything special before the urine sample? Drink a lot of water, or… anything? I’m always a bit flustered when I’m at the doctor’s office, so I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will write down a summary of the potential causes for you now. As for the urine sample, I would recommend drinking a normal amount of water before you come in – not excessively, but enough to ensure you can produce a good sample. Avoid drinking caffeinated beverages for a few hours beforehand, as they can affect the results. When you arrive, you’ll be given a sterile cup, and you’ll be asked to collect a midstream sample – that means starting to urinate, then collecting the sample mid-flow. I’ll have a nurse explain the process to you in detail when you’re ready. We will have the nurse prepare the room for the scan after you give the urine sample. Does that sound manageable, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Yes, that does sound manageable, Doctor. Normal amount of water, no caffeine, and a midstream sample. I can remember that. Thank you for explaining it all so carefully. I suppose… I suppose we should get started then. Where do I go to give the sample? And will the nurse be a nice one? I’m a bit shy, you see. And I don't like being cold.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. The nurse’s station is just outside the door. I’ll let them know you’re coming, and they'll be expecting you. I’ll ask Nurse Chen to assist you, as she is very gentle and understanding. She'll guide you through the process and make sure you are comfortable. And she will make sure the room is warm for you. I’ll step out to let her know you're ready, and she’ll be right in.
