DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. It’s… going to the restroom, frequently. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn't say it’s painful, just… a constant need to go. It’s been happening for… some time now, I believe. Perhaps a few weeks? It's hard to be certain.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Frequent urination. And you’re certain it’s more frequent than your normal pattern?
PATIENT: Yes, quite certain. I… well, I live alone, you see. And I don't generally keep… meticulous records. But it's disrupting my routine, that much I can say. I find myself… planning my day around it, if that makes any sense. It's not something I've experienced before, not to this degree. Though, to be honest, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Disrupting your routine is… inconvenient. And a decline in memory is not uncommon at your age. Let's try to get some specifics. When you say “frequent,” roughly how many times would you estimate you're urinating in a 24-hour period?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a specific question. Hmm… Let me think. I suppose… before, I would say… two or three times a day, perhaps? And now… well, it feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six or seven times? It’s difficult to be precise, Doctor. Truly. I don’t… measure these things. And sometimes at night, too. Which is new.
DOCTOR: Six or seven times a day, including overnight. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No… not really. I feel… a little tired, perhaps? But that could be anything. I haven’t been sleeping particularly well lately, and I am getting on in years, after all. No pain, no burning… just the constant need to go. And a slight… thirst, maybe? But I drink a fair amount of tea, so that’s not necessarily unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no burning, some fatigue, and a slight increase in thirst. You mentioned tea – how much tea would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, a good question. I do enjoy my tea. Perhaps… four or five cups? Maybe six on a colder day. Mostly black tea, with a little milk. Not much sugar, I assure you. I’ve always preferred a stronger brew. I suppose I could cut back, if necessary. Is that what you’re thinking, Doctor? That the tea might be contributing to this?
DOCTOR: It's possible. Though frankly, I find patients often overestimate their intake. We’ll need to rule out other causes before attributing it to tea. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… Now that's a question. I hadn't really paid much attention, to be honest. Is there something I should be looking for? I suppose… it looks normal. The usual colour, I believe. Nothing… cloudy or anything like that. I really haven’t scrutinized it, Doctor. I am an environmental engineer, not a medical professional, you understand. I deal with water quality on a much larger scale. A few drops in a porcelain bowl doesn’t generally concern me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Well, let's proceed with a physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I am happy to cooperate. Do tell me if anything feels… unpleasant. Though I suspect my understanding of “unpleasant” may be somewhat limited these days.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just follow me. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll also perform a quick digital rectal exam. Routine procedure, to assess prostate size and check for any abnormalities. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief.
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. I see. Well. Yes. Routine, you say? Brief, you assure me? I suppose… if it's necessary. I wasn't anticipating that, to be perfectly honest. Lead the way, Doctor. I trust you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's a standard part of evaluating urinary symptoms in men of your age. Now, if you'll just lie on your side… We'll get this over with quickly.
PATIENT: .
