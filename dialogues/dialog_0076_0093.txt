DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s… sleep, mostly. And, I guess, feeling a bit… off. Not exactly unfit, you understand. I keep things in order. Always have. But it's just… not right, lately. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. It’s been a while since… things. But I figure a tune-up couldn’t hurt. Like with a violin, you know? Gotta keep everything properly adjusted.
DOCTOR: "A tune-up," right. Vague is… unhelpful, frankly. But alright. Let’s try this. When did you first notice this 'off' feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? Weeks ago, probably. Months? Time… it all blends together, doesn’t it? After… well. Look, I’m not good with dates. It was after a particularly… upsetting incident, I suppose. Though whether that caused it, or it was just… coming anyway, I couldn’t say. I just know I haven’t been sleeping properly since. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning all night, just… not restful. And I wake up… not feeling… sharp.
DOCTOR: "Upsetting incident," you say. And not "sharp"… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? It's hardly something one elaborates on, is it? It was… a loss. A significant one. My wife, you see. Happened a while back now. Honestly, I try not to dwell. But… it’s hard to explain. I just don’t have the… drive I used to. The focus. Used to be able to work on an instrument for hours without a break. Now? I find myself… distracted. Losing track of small details. It’s… irritating, frankly.
DOCTOR: Right. A loss. And this lack of focus… is it impacting your work?
PATIENT: Impact? It’s… slowing things down. I still get the jobs done, of course. I’m a professional. But I have to check my work twice now. Sometimes three times. Little things, you understand. A slightly off-key tuning, a loose screw… things I’d have caught immediately before. It’s… beneath me, really. And it takes longer. Which… means less time for other things. Though, to be honest, I’m not exactly overflowing with… interests these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said sleep is… not restful?
PATIENT: Not restful. It’s… I fall asleep alright. No trouble with that, thankfully. But it’s… shallow. Like I haven’t properly… sunk in. I wake up feeling… disconnected. Not tired, exactly. More like… unrefreshed. And I find myself… drifting off during the day. Not full-blown naps, just… little moments. While I’m working, even. It’s… unsettling. Makes me wonder if I’m coming down with something. Though, honestly, I haven't been feeling ill, per se. Just… out of sorts.
DOCTOR: Out of sorts. Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… well, my appetite’s been… variable, I suppose. Some days I could eat a horse, others I barely touch a thing. And… I wouldn't say I’m irritable, but… people are more… trying lately. It’s not their fault, of course. They just… lack a certain… finesse. And… occasionally, my hands… tremble a bit. Nothing major, just… a slight wavering when I'm doing particularly delicate work. But it’s enough to throw off my timing.
DOCTOR: Tremors… when were you first aware of those?
PATIENT: Aware of them? Oh, it’s been… recent. Within the last month, I’d say. Maybe six weeks? It’s hard to pinpoint. They’re not constant, mind you. Only when I’m… focused. When I’m really concentrating on a small detail. Like tightening a bridge or adjusting a soundpost. It’s… frustrating, really. I have steady hands. Always have. It’s essential for my work. Makes me wonder if I should… retire, perhaps. Though what would I do all day?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any family history of… tremors, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions? Family history? Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea. My parents… well, they’re gone now. And we weren’t exactly a family for… detailed medical discussions. My father was… a man of few words. And my mother… she was preoccupied. Mostly with… social engagements. I doubt either of them ever spent much time considering such things. So, no, I can’t tell you anything about family history. I’m afraid I’m rather… disconnected from that side of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh. Well, nothing regularly. The doctor gave me something for… the nerves, after… after my wife. But I didn’t… take to it. Made me feel… sluggish. So, I stopped. That was… a while ago now. Just… some over-the-counter things occasionally. For headaches. Aspirin, mostly. And sometimes, if I’m really struggling to sleep, I’ll take a… a herbal remedy. Something with chamomile, I think. But it doesn’t really do much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Is that really necessary? I assure you, I'm in perfectly good… working order. But… Very well. If you insist. Though I warn you, I haven't been properly… exercised in some time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. Let's see your reflexes... And how about this side... Good. Now, walk a few steps for me. And can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Honestly, I feel like a… specimen. But very well. There. Is that satisfactory? Perfectly steady, you see. Always have been. There. Perfectly accurate. Though, I confess, my hands are feeling a bit… unsteady today.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Your gait is… stable, but a little stiff. And I observed a slight tremor in your hands when performing the finger-to-nose test. Given your history and these findings… it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause without further investigation. We should rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a brain MRI, just to rule out any structural issues. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? An MRI? Honestly, this is all rather… excessive. I came in complaining of a bit of sleeplessness and a slight tremor, not… a full-blown medical overhaul. An MRI… is that absolutely necessary? It sounds… invasive. And expensive, no doubt. I assure you, I'm perfectly… functional. A bit tired, perhaps, but… Very well. If you insist. But I trust this won't be a prolonged affair. I have work to do, you understand. I don't have time for… endless tests.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concerns. The blood work is fairly routine. The MRI… is precautionary. It will give us a clearer picture. I'll write the orders now. In the meantime, I recommend you try to establish a regular sleep schedule, and avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed. I also suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. The lab and imaging center are both located nearby. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A regular sleep schedule… yes, I suppose. Though I assure you, I'm quite capable of managing my own affairs. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol… hardly a hardship. Honestly, I feel like I’m being treated like a… child. But very well. Two weeks, you say? I suppose I can spare the time. But I expect a definitive answer. I don’t appreciate wasting my time. And if it turns out to be nothing… I trust I won't be presented with a hefty bill.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll see you in two weeks, Mr. Redfern. Please let the front desk know if you have any questions regarding the billing. And… try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Rest. As if that's simply a matter of… trying.
