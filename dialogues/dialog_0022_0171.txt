DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. The... nails. They look funny. Not good funny. Just... funny. I don't remember how they got funny, exactly. Been a long time, I guess. They just... changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, your nails… they've changed recently, and you're not sure how. That's alright, we can figure it out. Could you describe what you mean by "funny"?
PATIENT: Well... they're not smooth. You know? Like, they got... ridges. And the color... it's not pink anymore. It’s kinda... yellowish. Like old teeth, maybe? I don't know. I don't usually look at my hands, to be honest. Too busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, ridges and a yellowish color… I understand. And this has been happening for a while now, you said?
PATIENT: A while. Yes. Not like yesterday, definitely not. Maybe… months? I don't keep track of these things. I got better things to do than stare at my nails, you know? It’s not like it’s a big problem, really. Just… noticed it. It’s kinda gross, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you brought it to my attention. Even if it doesn’t seem like a big problem, it’s always best to check these things out. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes to your skin or if you have any other symptoms alongside the nail changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm... Let me think. No. Not really. I get tired, but everyone gets tired, right? And my knees ache sometimes, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. Nothing with the nails, though. Just the nails. And they're kinda brittle. Keep breaking. It’s annoying. I always have to file them. You know? Is this going to take long? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: We'll try to be as efficient as possible. I just want to gather a bit more information to get a better idea of what’s happening. You mentioned tiredness and knee pain - are those new symptoms, or have you been experiencing those for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the tiredness... that's been forever, honestly. Always tired. And the knees... maybe a year? Two? I don't know! It comes and goes. I take some pills for it, sometimes. The orange ones. I forget what they’re called. My neighbor gives them to me. She's a nurse. Much more organized than I am. This nail thing isn’t like the knees, though. This is... new-ish. A few months. Definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tiredness and knee pain are ongoing issues, and the nail changes are more recent. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh dear. That’s… a lot. I go to the doctor sometimes. For check-ups. And when I fall. I get Medicare, so I should be keeping track of things, but… I don’t. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And I think I had pneumonia once? Or maybe it was my neighbor. She gets sick all the time. I honestly can’t remember. Is this important? I'm not usually sick. Mostly just tired.
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don’t remember everything precisely. Just any major illnesses or surgeries you recall are helpful. You mentioned having your gallbladder removed, that’s good to know. And you think you may have had pneumonia at some point. We can try to look up your records if that’s alright with you to confirm, if you'd like?
PATIENT: Oh, records. That sounds… complicated. No, no, it’s alright. Don’t bother with records. It was a long time ago, probably. I just want to know about the nails. Are they serious? Are they going to fall off? Because that would be awful. I need my hands. I do… things. Important things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s unlikely they’ll fall off, Ms. Thut, but let’s take a closer look to see what we’re dealing with. Would you mind if I examine your hands and nails?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, okay? They're sensitive. And don't take too long. My lunch date is getting closer. What is lunch, anyway? Is it a fungus? I don't like fungus.
DOCTOR: No, lunch isn't a fungus! It's a meal. Don't worry. Okay, I see the ridges you mentioned, and the color is indeed yellowish. The nails are also quite brittle, as you said. I don't see any signs of inflammation around the nail beds, which is good. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, this could be a number of things. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, a fungal infection—though, as you said, we don't see any clear signs of that right now—or even just a sign of aging. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order a simple blood test. It will check for common vitamin deficiencies and help rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood test? Oh dear. I hate needles. Is it a big needle? And will it hurt? I get dizzy easily. And what if it shows something bad? I don’t want to know about bad things. I just want normal nails. Can't you just… give me a cream? Or some pills? Something easy? My neighbor has lots of creams. She probably has a nail cream. I'm sure she does.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needles, Ms. Thut. It’s a very common fear. The needle is quite small—standard for a blood draw—and the discomfort is usually very minimal, just a quick pinch. We'll have you lie down during the draw to prevent any dizziness. While I understand the desire for a quick fix, a cream or pills without knowing the underlying cause might not address the problem effectively, and could even mask a more serious issue. A blood test will give us the information we need to make an informed decision about the best course of treatment. However, I respect your anxiety. If you're truly uncomfortable with the blood test at this time, we can discuss alternative options. We could start with a topical antifungal cream as a trial, but I would still strongly recommend the blood test to rule out other possibilities. Would that be a compromise you’d be comfortable with?
PATIENT: Oh dear, this is all so complicated. A compromise... yes. That sounds... less scary. A cream first. Just a cream. But if it doesn't work, I'm not doing any blood tests. Promise? My neighbor said doctors like to do too many tests. She said it's a way to make more money. What kind of cream is it? And how long do I have to use it? I have a lunch date, you know. Can't be putting smelly creams on my hands before lunch.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. We can start with a topical antifungal cream, and if it doesn’t show improvement, we’ll respect your decision about the blood test. I understand your concerns about unnecessary tests, and I assure you, my priority is your well-being, not maximizing tests. The cream is called clotrimazole, and it’s a common antifungal medication. It’s generally odorless or has a very faint scent, so it shouldn't interfere with your lunch date. You'll apply a thin layer to each affected nail twice daily for about six weeks. It’s important to be consistent with the application, even if you don’t see immediate results. To be thorough, I also want to ask about your diet. Do you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables?
PATIENT: Fruits and vegetables? Hmm... sometimes. I like ice cream better, to be honest. And cookies. And cake. My neighbor makes a very good chocolate cake. It has lots of frosting. I don't eat much green stuff. Makes me feel… funny. Does it matter? I thought we were talking about nails. So, just put the cream on? Twice a day? For six weeks? And then what? Will my nails be normal again? I have a very important event next year, and I need my hands to look nice. It's a... a celebration.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Thut, everyone enjoys treats! Dietary changes aren’t essential right now, but a balanced diet can contribute to healthy nail growth. Yes, just apply the cream twice a day for six weeks. And then we'll re-evaluate. Most people see improvement with this treatment, and it's very possible your nails will return to normal. However, if you don’t see any improvement after six weeks, or if the condition worsens, we'll need to consider other possibilities. At that point, we can discuss the blood test again, or refer you to a dermatologist for further evaluation. Here's the prescription. The pharmacist will provide instructions on how to apply the cream properly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Dermatologist? Oh dear. That sounds… expensive. And scary. No, I don't want to see a dermatologist. No questions. Just... the cream. And hopefully, that's all I need. Six weeks. Right? Thank you, Doctor. I have a lunch date. I should go. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Thut. I hope the cream helps! And enjoy your lunch date. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll see you back in six weeks to check on your progress. Have a good day! .
