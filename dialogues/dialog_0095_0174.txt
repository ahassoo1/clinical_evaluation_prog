DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… a pleasure, I suppose. Honestly, I’m not usually one for… well, this. But my daughter insisted. She says I haven’t been myself lately. I believe the word she used was “down.” I just… haven’t been feeling quite right. If you want to get straight to it, I suppose it’s depression, as she says. Though I’d hardly call myself an expert on such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good of your daughter to look out for you, and it’s perfectly alright to not be sure what’s going on. We’ll figure it out together. “Not feeling quite right” can mean a lot of things. Could you tell me a bit more about what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? I suppose… a lack of interest in things I used to enjoy. I've been a lifeguard – and ski patrol, believe it or not – for… well, a very long time. Always liked being useful, keeping people safe. Lately, even the thought of the beach… or the slopes… feels tiring. And I sleep… too much, I think. Or maybe not enough. It's all a bit muddled. And I just feel… heavy. A weight on my chest, you know? It’s been going on for… oh, a few months now, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Loss of interest in activities you usually enjoy, changes in sleep, and feeling weighed down… those are all things we'd want to explore further. You mentioned this has been going on for a few months. Has anything specific happened around the time these feelings started?
PATIENT: Specific? Not that I recall. My divorce was… some years ago now. It’s not… that. My ex-husband and I, we simply grew apart. It was amicable, as such things go. I’ve kept busy since, always something to do. Oh… my oldest grandson, he moved away for university. That was… bittersweet. He’s a good boy, always a good student. But… it left a bit of a hole, I suppose. Nothing major, though. Just… life.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it’s not one big event, but a series of smaller changes that can add up. And it sounds like your grandson moving away was definitely a significant change. You mentioned feeling "down"—have you noticed any other changes in your mood?
PATIENT: Well… I wouldn’t say I’ve been happy. Not joyful, like I used to be. I find myself… irritable, perhaps. Snapping at people over small things. And I… I cry more easily, I think. Silly things will make me tear up. I don’t… I don’t usually cry. It's rather embarrassing, actually. And my appetite… it’s all over the place. Some days I don't want to eat anything. Others… I just… eat. Without even tasting it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Irritability, increased tearfulness, and changes in appetite—those all fit with what we're discussing. Have you had any difficulty concentrating or remembering things lately?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. A bit. Nothing… debilitating, you understand. But I’ll forget where I put things. Or… what I was saying mid-sentence. My daughter keeps telling me I repeat myself. She says it’s “concerning.” It’s… annoying, to be honest. I've always had a good memory. Lifeguarding requires attention to detail, you know. And ski patrol… well, people’s lives depend on it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It is concerning when things start to change, especially when it affects your memory and concentration. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not particularly. My blood pressure’s a little high, but it's managed with medication. Nothing else… Oh, I had a knee replacement a few years back, but that healed well. I'm otherwise… fairly robust, for my age, I think. I've always been active. I've never been one for sitting still. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee replacement. We'll make a note of those. And yes, your insurance information is helpful. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for my knee, if it's acting up. That's it, I believe. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand. My mother always said… "too much medicine will do more harm than good." Though I suppose times have changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril and ibuprofen as needed. And noted about your mother’s advice. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat most things, thankfully. I used to live near a lot of dust when I was younger, but never had a reaction. I suppose I’m fairly… unremarkable in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, just a few more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean? I… I keep to myself mostly. I have a few friends from my lifeguarding days, but we don't see each other often. I have my daughter, of course, and my grandchildren. I'm divorced, as I mentioned. Never remarried. Not much to tell, really. I’ve always preferred a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's perfectly alright. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Especially on Fridays. It helps me relax. But… not every week. And certainly not to excess. I’m not a big drinker, never have been. My mother didn’t approve, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a dreadful habit. My late husband… he smoked for a while, but he gave it up years ago. Good for him.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking. Now, just one last thing before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have any family history of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Now that’s a difficult question. My mother… she was a very private woman. She never spoke much about her family. I know my aunt… on my father's side… she was… “difficult,” my father used to say. He wouldn’t elaborate. But I believe she spent some time in a hospital, many years ago. Perhaps for… nerves, or something similar? I honestly don’t know. It wasn't something discussed. And my father… he was a very stoic man. He wouldn’t have admitted to anything like that. So, I'm afraid I can't really answer your question with any certainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Limited information regarding family history. That's alright, we can proceed without it. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As long as it won’t take too long. I have… appointments later this afternoon. And honestly, I'm not fond of doctors. Not that you’re doing anything wrong, of course. It's just… I prefer to be proactive, not… poked and prodded. But if you must, I suppose. Please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Derasmo. I'll be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you are. Do be careful with that cuff… it always feels so tight.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not significantly different from what you've likely been told before. Now I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I haven’t had my heart checked in… a long time. I try to stay active, as I said. Swimming keeps me fit, I believe.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, good air entry. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is everything alright? I sometimes feel a little… off balance, especially when I stand up quickly. I thought it was just my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. And now, stand up slowly for me, if you can. Your balance is a bit unsteady, as you mentioned, and it takes a moment to stabilize. I'm noting that. Now, sit back down please. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable, given your age and medical history. The slightly elevated blood pressure and mild balance issues are the main things I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t as dreadful as I feared. But… what does it mean, Doctor? Am I… seriously ill? My daughter will be beside herself if she finds out.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say you're seriously ill, Ms. Derasmo. It's more likely that we're dealing with a combination of factors – your age, your blood pressure, and potentially some early signs of balance issues. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect we're looking at possible depression, as your daughter mentioned, and a need to further investigate your blood pressure and balance. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical causes for your symptoms. I also recommend a basic neurological assessment to evaluate your balance and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: More tests? Oh dear. Well… I suppose it’s better to be thorough. But I really don't like being poked and prodded. And the thought of waiting for results… it’s all rather stressful. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose. Yes, go ahead with the tests. But please, make it as quick and painless as possible. And… tell me what I'm supposed to do, clearly. I don't want any misunderstandings.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Derasmo. I'll make sure everything is as quick and painless as possible, and I'll explain everything clearly. I'll order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. These are standard tests, and they'll give us a good baseline. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take a small blood sample from your arm. It should only take a few minutes. After the blood tests, I'll give you a referral to a neurologist for a brief assessment of your balance and coordination. They may do some simple tests, like walking and standing exercises. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your usual activities as much as possible. And if you find yourself feeling particularly down or anxious, please don't hesitate to reach out. Here are the instructions for the lab, and the contact information for the neurologist. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A neurologist… oh dear. More specialists. It’s all rather overwhelming. I suppose… no. Not at the moment. Just… where is the lab, exactly? And… will I need to make an appointment? I really dislike making appointments. It takes forever to get one.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. You don't need to make an appointment; it's a walk-in clinic. Just tell them Dr. Vanochten sent you for the blood tests. They'll take care of everything. They'll give you a slip to bring back to me with the results. And don’t worry too much, Ms. Derasmo. This is just a precaution, to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. We'll take things one step at a time. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient. Though I still think all these tests are unnecessary. But… my daughter would insist, I suppose. Very well. I’ll go to the lab, and then… I’ll schedule an appointment with the neurologist. Though I’m not looking forward to it. Goodbye, Doctor. And… please, don’t expect miracles. I’m an old woman. Things don’t improve at my age.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Derasmo. And I understand your concerns. We're not expecting miracles, just trying to get a clear understanding of what's going on. Remember, even small improvements can make a big difference. Here's my card. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and please, don't worry too much. I’ll be in touch once we have the results.
