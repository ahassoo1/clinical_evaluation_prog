DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on and on about it. Says it’s good for everything. I just want to see if it’s…suitable, shall we say, for a woman of my standing. And if it’s even legal, properly. I don't want any trouble with the authorities, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. It's wise to be cautious and get proper information. We can certainly discuss medical marijuana – its potential benefits, risks, and legality. It’s a complicated topic, and regulations do vary. Before we get into that, could you tell me a little more about why your daughter suggests it?
PATIENT: Well, she says it’s good for sleeping, mostly. And…aches and pains. She's always going on about inflammation. Honestly, I manage just fine with a hot bath and a good cup of chamomile tea. But she insists it’s better. And she reads all sorts of things online, you know how young people are. She’s very…enthusiastic. I just thought, perhaps, if it truly could help…I wouldn’t want to be left behind, would I? Though I do find it a bit…undignified, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're approaching this with thoughtful consideration. It’s common to explore different options for sleep and pain management. And it’s perfectly reasonable to want to stay informed. So, to clarify, you're mainly interested in whether medical marijuana might be helpful for sleep and aches and pains?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, I must say, my aches and pains are perfectly normal for a woman of seventy-four. It’s not as if I’m…falling apart. But if it could improve my sleep, that would be…acceptable. I do find myself waking up a bit earlier than I’d like these days. And my husband, Harold, he snores, you see. It's a constant disruption. Perhaps this…marijuana…would help me ignore him. Is that terribly selfish, do you think?
DOCTOR: Not at all selfish, Ellan. A good night's sleep is essential for everyone, and it sounds like Harold's snoring is definitely a factor. We can certainly explore options to address that, medical marijuana being one of them. Before we delve further into that, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had the measles as a child, naturally. And chickenpox. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu in 1987, but recovered splendidly. Harold always said I had a constitution of steel. I’ve never been one for complaining, you see. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but it was a very routine procedure. No complications whatsoever. And…let me see…oh, I do have slightly elevated blood pressure, the doctor tells me. But it's managed with a small pill each morning. That’s…that’s about it, I think. I’m generally a very healthy woman. Do you need specifics? I don’t see why that matters for…this.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Knowing about the elevated blood pressure is important, even if it's well-managed. And the gallbladder removal is good to know as well. It's good you're generally healthy. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Well, let me think…Harold’s arthritis flares up sometimes, and he makes me rub a cream on his knees. It smells terribly strong, something like wintergreen. Does that count? Aside from that…no. Just a multivitamin every now and then. And, of course, chamomile tea. I make it myself, you know. Fresh chamomile from the garden. It’s far superior to those bagged teas. Really, I don’t take much at all. I believe in natural remedies whenever possible. Is this becoming tedious? I apologize. I’m not usually one to ramble.
DOCTOR: Not at all tedious, Ellan. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture. Knowing about the cream Harold uses is good to note, but it doesn’t sound like something you’re taking yourself. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies…let me think. I had a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin as a child. A rash, mostly. Harold says I turned as red as a beet. I've avoided it ever since. And…I don’t care much for shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy, I suppose. Dust bothers me a bit, makes me sneeze, but I hardly think that’s relevant. And…I’m slightly sensitive to strong perfumes. They give me a headache. That’s all I can think of, really. Nothing terribly serious. Do you need a list? Harold keeps all sorts of medical records, you know. He’s very meticulous.
DOCTOR: Thank you. The penicillin allergy is important to note, and the sensitivity to perfumes is good to know as well. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, let's quickly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history…that’s a difficult one. My mother, bless her soul, she had…arthritis, I believe. Badly. Couldn’t knit anymore, poor thing. My father, he had a weak heart. Passed away rather suddenly, actually. My brother, he has…diabetes, I think. And my sister…she’s always been a bit…delicate. Prone to colds and flu. Honestly, it’s not a particularly healthy lineage, if you want to know the truth. Mostly aches and pains and…general fragility. Is that helpful? I feel I’m not being very precise. I never paid much attention to medical details, you see. Harold was always the one for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ellan. Knowing about the arthritis, heart condition, and diabetes in your family is good information. Don’t worry about being precise; you’re providing what you recall, and that’s perfectly fine. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I always thought it was a terribly unhealthy habit. My father warned me about it when I was a little girl, said it would ruin your lungs. And Harold…well, Harold wouldn't dream of it. He's a very proper man. Never touched a cigarette in his life. I can’t imagine what you’re getting at, honestly. Are you suggesting I…engage in such a…debauched activity? It’s quite shocking, really. I merely want to explore the possibility of medical marijuana, for a bit of sleep, you understand. Not…this. It’s rather insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Oh, my apologies, Ellan. I assure you, I wasn’t suggesting anything of the sort. It’s standard medical questioning, as the method of delivery for medical marijuana can vary. I simply needed to know if you had any history of smoking to rule out any potential complications. Alright. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana itself, let's talk about your social habits. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, well, yes. A little. Just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Harold enjoys a sherry before bed. It helps him sleep, he says. And during the holidays, we might have a small cocktail party. But nothing excessive, you understand. We’re not…bohemians. It’s just a civilized habit, really. We certainly don’t have any problems with alcohol. I wouldn’t dream of getting…intoxicated. It’s quite undignified, frankly. We simply enjoy a small glass of wine with our meals. Is that…satisfactory? I hope I’m not being difficult. It’s just…I’m not accustomed to answering such personal questions.
DOCTOR: Not at all difficult, Ellan. It's helpful to have a complete picture, and I appreciate your honesty. A small glass of wine occasionally is perfectly fine. Now, to get back to your initial concern, medical marijuana. As you know, it's becoming increasingly available for various conditions. However, it's important to understand its potential benefits and risks, as well as the legal considerations here in the city. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about it before we proceed?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Several, actually. Firstly, will it…make me feel…odd? My daughter keeps talking about being “relaxed,” but I’m perfectly capable of relaxing on my own, thank you very much. I don’t want to be…giddy. And secondly, is it legal? I certainly don’t want to end up in trouble with the authorities. Harold would be terribly upset. And thirdly, will it interfere with my chamomile tea? I’ve been drinking it for years, and it works wonders. And finally, and perhaps most importantly, will it make me…forgetful? I already have enough trouble remembering where I put my glasses, you see. I don’t need any additional complications. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ellan, and perfectly reasonable concerns. Let’s address them one by one. Firstly, regarding feeling “odd,” the effects of medical marijuana vary greatly depending on the strain, dosage, and individual. The goal isn’t to get “giddy,” but to manage symptoms. We would start with a very low dose and carefully monitor your response. We can also discuss strains known for their calming effects without being overly psychoactive. Secondly, legality is a complex issue. Here in the city, medical marijuana is legal with a doctor’s recommendation for qualifying conditions. We would ensure you meet the criteria before proceeding. Thirdly, there's no known interaction between medical marijuana and chamomile tea. However, both can have a calming effect, so you might want to start with a smaller dose of both to see how you feel. And finally, regarding forgetfulness, it's true that marijuana can affect short-term memory. However, this is usually temporary and more pronounced with higher doses. Again, starting with a very low dose and monitoring your response is key. Does that answer your questions, or would you like me to elaborate on any of those points?
PATIENT: That’s…somewhat reassuring, I suppose. But I’m still rather hesitant. It all sounds terribly complicated. And frankly, a bit…undignified. I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own, you see. Hot baths, chamomile tea, a good night’s sleep…that’s all I’ve ever needed. But my daughter…she’s been so insistent. She says it could improve my quality of life. And Harold…well, he’s starting to look at me with a rather…concerned expression whenever he sees me struggling to sleep. Perhaps…perhaps I should just try it. But only a tiny amount, you understand. And only if it’s perfectly legal. And only if it doesn’t interfere with my chamomile tea. And only if it doesn’t make me forget where I put my glasses. Is that…possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ellan, that is absolutely possible. We can proceed very cautiously and address all of your concerns. We would start with the lowest possible dose, ensure you understand the potential effects, and monitor your response closely. We will only proceed if it's legal and doesn't interfere with your current routine, including your beloved chamomile tea. And we’ll keep a close eye on any potential side effects, such as memory issues. If you’re willing, we can start with a consultation to determine if you qualify for a medical marijuana recommendation. We would review your medical history in more detail and discuss the potential benefits and risks specifically for your situation. Would you like me to schedule that consultation for you?
PATIENT: Well…alright. If you insist. And if it truly is perfectly legal. And if it doesn’t interfere with my chamomile tea. And if it doesn’t make me forget where I put my glasses. And if it’s only a tiny amount. And if Harold approves. Yes. Schedule the consultation, I suppose. But only if it's convenient. I have my book club meeting on Wednesdays, you see. And Harold has his…pigeon fanciers club on Thursdays. It’s terribly busy, you understand. But yes, schedule the consultation. But only a tiny amount. And please, no funny business. I’m a woman of a certain age, you know. I don't need any complications.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. I understand completely. We'll make sure to accommodate your schedule. Let me see… we have an opening next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
