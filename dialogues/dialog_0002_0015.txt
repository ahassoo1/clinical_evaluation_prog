DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… it’s my sinuses, I think. They been… bothering me. For a little while now. I don’t… remember exactly how long, but a few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of sinus trouble. I understand it can be hard to pinpoint exactly when things started. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you describe the bother?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like… pressure. Mostly here, and… around my eyes, sometimes. And my nose feels… stuffy. Not always, but often. It’s not… a bad pain, not like a headache. Just… uncomfortable. And I feel… tired, maybe because of it? I don’t know. It's difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure around your forehead and eyes, stuffiness, and some fatigue. That does sound uncomfortable. Is the stuffiness on one side more than the other, or is it pretty equal?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe a little worse on this side. But not much. It changes, I think. Some days it feels more on the right, and some days… both sides are the same. It’s… confusing. I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates and seems to be slightly more prominent on the left side at times. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure and stuffiness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Sometimes I cough. Not a lot, but a little bit. And… I think my nose… runs sometimes. But not always. It’s hard to tell with the stuffiness, you know? Everything feels… blocked. I don’t know if it’s running or just… stuck. And… maybe a little bit of a sore throat? But it’s not a bad sore throat. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we've got cough, some nasal discharge – though it's hard to tell with the congestion – and a mild sore throat. Have you had a fever, or felt like you’ve been running a temperature at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. No fever. I haven’t… checked. I don’t have a thermometer. I just… feel tired, like I said. Not hot, not cold… just tired. And achy, sometimes. But not a bad ache. It’s… hard to explain all of this. It’s just… not feeling right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like a lot of subtle symptoms, which can make it tricky. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. I don’t know. I don’t… really pay attention to smells and tastes. I eat… what my husband makes. And I don’t… notice if things smell different. Sorry. I don’t think I can help you with that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in smell or taste that you've noticed. Have you been around anyone who’s been sick recently – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well… my grandson, little Mateo, had a cold last week. He was sneezing a lot. But I only saw him for a few hours. He stayed… over there. I don’t think I was very close to him. And my husband… he sometimes coughs in the mornings. But that’s just… his cough. He’s had it for a long time. I don't know if that counts?
DOCTOR: Okay, possible exposure to your grandson’s cold and your husband’s chronic cough. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that you’re aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't… been to a doctor in a long time. I usually just… rest when I'm sick. My husband, he takes care of me. He says I'm… strong. I don't have any… conditions. Just… old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. No surgeries, no hospital. I've been… lucky, I think. Just… a few bad colds when I was a little girl. But nothing serious. My husband says I have a strong immune system. He always says that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I don't take… many medicines. Just… sometimes, for headaches. But… I don't remember what they're called. And I eat… everything. Well, almost everything. My husband makes good food. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. But I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, for my headaches. Like I said. But… not right now. I haven't had a bad headache in a while. And… no vitamins. My husband says I get enough from my food. He worries about me. I don't take anything regularly. Just… when I need to. I think. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Now, just to finish up with the history, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My… family? Um… my mother… she had… problems with her heart, I think. But she lived a long life. And my father… he had… trouble breathing when he got old. But he smoked a lot. My husband’s family… they’re all very healthy. He says it’s the good food. I don’t… know much about their history. They live… far away. It’s hard to remember everything. I think… everyone gets sick sometimes. It’s just… life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, some heart problems with your mother and breathing issues with your father, likely related to smoking. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and maybe take your temperature. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My husband always says I should listen to the doctor. But… will it hurt? I don’t like… pain.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all. It's very gentle. I'm just going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then feel around your sinuses to see if they're tender. Okay, take a deep breath for me... and again... Good. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some mild congestion. And now, let me just check for tenderness here... and here... Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Okay… Ooh… that’s… a little tender. Here. Not a bad pain, but… uncomfortable. And… maybe a little bit here, too. But not as much. Just… a little. It's hard to say. I don’t like being touched, you know? It makes me… nervous. But… it’s okay. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side is more pronounced, but also some mild tenderness on the right. I also noticed a slight nasal discharge when I examined your nose. Your temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, an inflammation of your sinuses, probably caused by a viral upper respiratory infection. The congestion I heard in your lungs is likely related to this as well. The mild fever and slightly elevated temperature are also consistent with a viral infection. It's not surprising that you feel tired and achy. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Sinusitis…? Viral… infection…? Um… yes, I think so. A little. So… it’s not… serious? I don’t want to… be sick for a long time. And… what does that mean? What do I… do? My husband, he likes to know what’s going on. He always says knowledge is power.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound serious at all. Viral sinusitis is very common and usually resolves on its own within 7-10 days. Think of it like a bad cold that settles in your sinuses. For now, I recommend focusing on symptom relief. That means getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids—water, tea, broth—and using a saline nasal spray to help clear out the congestion. You can also take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you're feeling uncomfortable. A warm compress over your sinuses might also help. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest… fluids… saline spray… acetaminophen… Saline spray… I don’t think I’ve ever used that. Where do I… find that? And acetaminophen… is that like… Tylenol? My husband, he buys Tylenol sometimes. He uses it for his back. And… how much should I take? I don't want to… mess anything up. And… if it doesn’t get better in ten days…? What then?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions. Yes, acetaminophen is the generic name for Tylenol. You can find it at most pharmacies, usually in the cold and flu aisle. For a mild infection like this, 500mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain or fever is a good starting point, but always follow the instructions on the label. As for the saline nasal spray, you can find that at most pharmacies as well. It comes in a spray bottle and you just gently spray it into your nostrils a couple of times a day to help moisten the nasal passages and clear out congestion. If your symptoms don't improve within ten days, or if they worsen at any point—if you develop a high fever, severe headache, or facial pain—please schedule another appointment, or go to an urgent care clinic. It's possible you might have a bacterial infection, which would require antibiotics. However, for now, let's try this conservative approach first. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. Rest, fluids, saline spray, Tylenol… and ten days. And… see you again if it gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. My husband will be… happy to hear all of this. He worries about me a lot. Is there… anything else I should know? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Just one more thing: try to avoid close contact with others if possible, to prevent spreading any potential infection. And make sure to wash your hands frequently. I'm going to print out a summary of our conversation and the recommendations for you to take home. It includes information about the saline spray and acetaminophen dosage, as well as signs to look out for that would warrant a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before I finish that up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that’s all. You’ve answered everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. I will… rest and drink fluids. And… wash my hands. My husband will be… very pleased.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. Get some rest, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s that summary for you. Take care of yourself, and have a good day. .
