DOCTOR: Hi Aldine, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. I've been having a headache, right at the back of my head, you see? It started a couple weeks ago, not too bad at first, just a little ache. But it’s been getting worse lately, and that’s why I thought I better come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that's been gradually worsening over the past couple of weeks. Can you tell me a bit more about the ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not a throbbing headache, not like a migraine. More of a… a constant pressure, if that makes sense? Like someone is tightening a band around my head, right at the back. Sometimes it feels a bit like a dull ache, other times it’s more like a tightness. And it seems to be worse in the evenings, after I’ve been on my feet all day. I do a lot of work with my hands, you see, being a manicurist.
DOCTOR: Alright, a constant pressure at the back of your head, worse in the evenings after being on your feet, and you're a manicurist. That's helpful. Has anything specific triggered the headache, or made it noticeably worse besides being on your feet all day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… not really anything specific, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, some days are just worse than others. I did try a new polish formula last week, one of those gel ones, but I don’t think that had anything to do with it. It started before that. Maybe stress? My wife and I are planning a trip back to Jamaica to see family, and all the arrangements… well, it can be a bit much sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear triggers besides activity and possibly some stress related to travel planning. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache – things like nausea, vomiting, changes in your vision, dizziness, or any weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No nausea, no vomiting, my vision is fine, and I haven’t felt dizzy or weak or anything. Just the headache. I have been a bit tired lately, but I put that down to getting older, you know? And the heat we've been having. It’s been awfully hot this summer.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other associated symptoms. Just the headache and some fatigue, which you attribute to age and the heat. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis, for example?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. My wife always says I'm too stubborn to get sick! I don’t have any diagnoses like that - no high blood pressure, no diabetes. My joints ache a bit sometimes, especially after a long day, but the doctor years ago said it’s just wear and tear. Nothing serious. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the last few years, to be honest. Just for check-ups, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy with some joint aches, no major medical diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. I've been lucky enough to avoid all that. Always been careful, you see. I believe in keeping active and eating well. My wife is a fantastic cook, helps a lot with that part!
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: What do you want to know about my family, Doctor? My mother, she lived to be 95, very strong woman. My father died younger, in his 70s, heart problems. He didn't take care of himself like he should have. My wife's mother has arthritis, bad in her hands. And my brother, he has high blood pressure, but he's on medication for it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. So, mother lived to 95, father died in his 70s from heart problems, wife’s mother has arthritis, and your brother has high blood pressure. Okay. And what about any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with food or medications or anything like that. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife is the one with sensitive skin, but I’m pretty robust, as I said!
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't take any medications regularly. I used to take something for my joints a few years back, but I stopped and it didn't seem to make much difference. Occasionally, if my head is really bothering me, I'll take a couple of paracetamol, you know, just a simple painkiller. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional paracetamol for the headache. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. It'll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's check your blood pressure. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic nerve function. All right, everything seems normal so far. I'm going to gently palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness. There's some slight tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. That could be contributing to your headache.
PATIENT: Oh, right there, yes, that's where it hurts a bit. It's not a sharp pain, just… tight. My wife sometimes rubs it when I’m complaining, and that helps for a little while, but it always comes back. It feels like those muscles are knotted up.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness at the base of your skull, with some muscle tightness. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds most likely like a tension headache. The muscle tenderness and tightness at the base of the skull are consistent with that. However, given your age and the gradual worsening of the symptoms, I’d like to be cautious. To rule out anything more serious, I’m going to order a simple blood test to check your inflammatory markers and a complete blood count. And just to be extra safe, I'd like to schedule you for an X-ray of your cervical spine. It's just a precaution, to make sure there aren't any underlying structural issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I don’t mind having the tests done if it puts my mind at ease. I’m not keen on being poked and prodded any more than necessary, but I’d rather be safe than sorry. So yes, please go ahead and schedule those tests for me. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me so carefully. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for blood work at the lab across the street - you can go any time next week. And I've requested the X-ray to be done at the imaging center down the block - they have appointments available on Wednesday afternoon. I'll have the results sent to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re back – probably next week as well. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and you can continue using heat or ice packs to your neck and shoulders. Avoid any strenuous activity that might aggravate your headache, and try to manage your stress levels. Are there any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. Ibuprofen or naproxen, heat or ice packs, avoid stress… I can manage all that. I suppose I'll just wait for the test results now, and hopefully everything is alright. Thank you again for your time. You've put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, if anything does change – if your headache suddenly worsens, you develop a fever, or you experience any new symptoms – don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Here's a summary of the appointment and instructions. Have a good day, Aldine. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
