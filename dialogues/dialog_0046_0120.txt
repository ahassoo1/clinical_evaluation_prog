DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be… easy, you know? My husband… well, was a good man, and we always… planned carefully. Now I just want a baby, and I don't want any trouble. Is that so much to ask? I have good insurance, so hopefully we can just make it happen.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Carmaleta. It’s very common to want things to go smoothly when you’re planning a family. And yes, it's perfectly reasonable to want to explore options to help make that happen. It sounds like you and your husband were very conscientious about family planning in the past, and now you're ready for the next step. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit more about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I don't pay that much attention. They come and go, I guess. Regular enough. I mean, I haven't been keeping a calendar or anything. Why does that even matter? I just… want to know what tests I need to get this moving. It’s not like I’m going to start charting things now. It feels a bit… silly, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel a bit tedious, Carmaleta, and I certainly don’t want to make you feel like you need to start a detailed log right away. Knowing the general pattern of your cycles—how often they come, how long they typically last—gives us a baseline. It helps us identify if everything is functioning as expected and can pinpoint the best time for certain tests or interventions. Roughly, how often would you say you get your period?
PATIENT: Ugh, look, every month, mostly. Sometimes a little… off. I don't know, maybe every 28 days? Give or take. Honestly, it's probably been a bit more irregular since… well, since he passed. Things just haven't been the same. Are you going to quiz me on this all day? I just want a quick check-up and then a plan.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta, and I apologize if I’m pressing too much. It's completely normal for cycles to be irregular, especially during times of stress or significant life changes, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's important to consider all factors. Since you mentioned things haven't been the same since your husband’s passing, have you noticed any other changes in your body or overall health?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I'm… older. That’s a change. I’m 43, you know. Things start to… slow down. I’m a bit tired, I guess. And maybe a little… heavier than I used to be. But who isn't? Honestly, I’m not sure what you’re getting at. Is this about my weight? Because I don't need a lecture on that, thank you very much. I just want to know if I need a bunch of tests and how long this is going to take.
DOCTOR: No, Carmaleta, absolutely not. I wasn’t implying anything about your weight. I’m simply gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It’s very common for changes in weight, energy levels, and overall well-being to occur with age, and these things can sometimes impact fertility. Since you've mentioned fatigue and a change in weight, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or mood?
PATIENT: Look, I eat when I’m hungry. I sleep when I’m tired. What kind of question is that? Honestly, this is just… frustrating. I've been through a lot, and I don’t need to rehash every little detail of my life. I just want to get pregnant, and I thought a doctor would, you know, do something, not ask me about my sleeping habits. Can we please just move on to the tests? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. You're right to want to focus on moving forward, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive or like they’re delaying things. It's clear you've been through a difficult time, and I respect your boundaries. Let's shift our focus to the tests. To start, I'd like to perform a basic physical exam, including checking your blood pressure, pulse, and weight, just to establish a baseline. Then, I recommend a blood test to check your hormone levels, specifically FSH, LH, and estradiol, as well as a complete blood count. We can also do a urine test to confirm you're not pregnant. Would that be alright with you?
