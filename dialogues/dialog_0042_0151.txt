DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Teretha Uzarski. It’s… well, it’s my hand. It’s been tingling, you see? Feels like little pins and needles. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and I thought I should probably get it checked out. I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hand. That's definitely worth getting checked out. When you say "a little bit now," can you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe three, four weeks ago? It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. Some days it's barely noticeable, other days… well, it's more annoying. I’m a mail carrier, so I’m always using my hands. Makes it a little harder when it's acting up.
DOCTOR: I see. Three or four weeks, comes and goes, and it's impacting your work as a mail carrier. That gives me a good starting point. Does the tingling affect all of your hand, or is it more localized to certain fingers or areas?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my thumb and the first couple of fingers, you know? Not so much the pinky. And sometimes it goes up my arm a little, just a little bit, but mostly it's in my hand. It’s hard to explain… it’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily thumb and first couple of fingers, sometimes a little up the arm, and more uncomfortable than painful. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that specifically brings on the tingling, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: Well… carrying the mail, definitely. Especially when the bags are heavy. And… I do a lot of sorting, you know? Lots of little movements with my hands. I thought maybe it was just from that, but it happens even when I’m not working, sometimes. Like, when I’m knitting, or just holding a cup of tea. Not always, but… yeah. It's funny, isn’t it? Seems to bother me no matter what I do.
DOCTOR: It’s not funny at all, it’s frustrating! And it's good you're paying attention to what triggers it. Okay, so it seems aggravated by repetitive movements, but also occurs with less strenuous activities. Let’s talk a little more broadly now. Have you had any other symptoms along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I mean, I'm getting older, so things ache here and there, you know? But nothing specific connected to the tingling. No weakness, no numbness, no pain anywhere else. Just… the pins and needles. And a little worry, I guess. Is it something serious? I haven't been to a doctor in a while, and… well, I’m a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Teretha. It's good you're here, and we'll figure this out together. No weakness or numbness is good to hear. Now, thinking about your medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with anything like arthritis, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. Arthritis, no. My mother had it, but I haven’t been diagnosed. Diabetes, no. My husband… he had some problems with his sugar, but I don’t. Thyroid… I think the doctor checked it once, years ago, but nothing came of it. Honestly, I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and I don’t keep very good track of things like that. I just try to stay active, you know? That’s what I always did.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known history of arthritis, diabetes, or thyroid problems. And that’s wonderful that you stay active! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or any serious injuries to your hand or arm?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky, that way. Just a few scrapes and bruises over the years, working with the mail. Nothing that needed a doctor. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, falling off a swing, but that healed up just fine. It was a long time ago, though. Doesn't bother me at all now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or significant injuries. Let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, she had the arthritis, like I said. And her mother, too. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And heart trouble, towards the end. My husband’s side… mostly just old age, you know? Nothing specific that I can think of. Everyone lived to be pretty old, thankfully. It’s just… I worry it’s something new, something I haven’t seen before.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis on your mother's side, and high blood pressure/heart trouble on your father's side. That’s good information. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I want to ask about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have.
PATIENT: Oh, medications… none. I don't take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, if I really need them. And allergies… I think I’m allergic to penicillin, but it was a long time ago. The doctor told me to avoid it, but honestly, I can't really remember all the details. It was when I was younger. I just know to tell doctors I might be allergic. It’s probably not a big deal, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, occasional over-the-counter pain relief, and a possible penicillin allergy. Thank you for letting me know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your hand and arm, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I’ll be checking your range of motion, strength, and reflexes, and feeling for any tenderness or swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing it, you know? It’s starting to worry me, especially with my job. I need my hands for my work. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. I'm noticing some mild tenderness along the base of your thumb, and a slight decrease in range of motion when you bend your wrist outwards. Your grip strength seems good, and your reflexes are normal. I don't feel any obvious swelling or masses. These findings are consistent with possible De Quervain's tenosynovitis, which is an inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. However, the tingling you described warrants further investigation to rule out other possibilities, like carpal tunnel syndrome or nerve compression in the arm. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: De… what now? Tenosyn… oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Is that serious? And carpal tunnel? I’ve heard of that… My friend used to get it, I think. Does that mean I need surgery? I really don’t want surgery. And nerve compression… what does that mean? I'm getting a little overwhelmed, Doctor. Maybe you could explain it in simpler terms? I’m not a medical person, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Teretha. It is a lot of information. Let’s break it down. De Quervain’s tenosynovitis, simply put, is inflammation of the tendons on the thumb side of your wrist. It can cause pain and difficulty moving your thumb, especially when gripping or twisting. Carpal tunnel syndrome is different. It’s caused by compression of a nerve in your wrist, and it often causes tingling and numbness in your fingers—which is what you're experiencing. Nerve compression means the nerve is being squeezed, like a hose that’s been kinked. Whether you need surgery depends on how severe it is and how well you respond to treatment. We'll start with conservative measures—things like a wrist splint, anti-inflammatory medication, and physical therapy—to see if we can relieve your symptoms. Surgery is usually only considered as a last resort. To be sure, I’d like to order a nerve conduction study. It's a painless test that measures the electrical activity in your nerves and can help us determine if carpal tunnel syndrome is the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A nerve… conduction study? Sounds a little scary, to be honest. Is it painful? Will it take long? I do have work, you know. And will insurance cover it? Oh, wait… I don’t have insurance. Will that be expensive? I’m a widow, and… well, money is a little tight. I just want to get this fixed, but I don’t want to get into a lot of debt over it. I'm sorry to ask about money, but I have to think about these things.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Teretha, and I understand your concerns completely. It's perfectly reasonable to think about the cost and time commitment. The nerve conduction study is not painful. It involves small electrodes being placed on your skin, and a mild electrical stimulation is used to measure the speed of the nerve signals. It feels like a tiny zap, but it’s generally well-tolerated. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. Regarding the cost, since you don’t have insurance, it can be expensive. Let me check the approximate cost with our billing department and see if there are any options for financial assistance or a payment plan. I will also see if we have any discounted rates for patients without insurance. Okay, the approximate cost of the nerve conduction study is $250. Our billing department has informed me that we do offer a 10% discount for self-pay patients, which would bring the cost down to $225. We also have a payment plan option where you can pay in installments. I will also ask our medical social worker to see if there are any local resources available to help with the cost of care. Would you like me to proceed with scheduling the test, and I’ll get you information about the payment plan and financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Okay… $225 is… still a bit much, but better than $250. A payment plan would be good, if possible. And yes, please ask about any other help available. I really appreciate you looking into that for me. It’s just… I didn’t expect this to be so complicated, or so expensive. Yes, go ahead and schedule the test, then. Whatever day is easiest, I guess. I’m pretty flexible. And please give me the information about the payment plan. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind to help me with this. I feel a little better just talking about it, even if I’m still worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I completely understand your worries, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for a nerve conduction study next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. The order will be sent to the neurology department, and they will contact you to confirm the appointment and provide instructions on how to prepare. I’m also printing out information about our payment plan options and a list of local resources that may be able to assist with the cost of care. Before you leave, I want to recommend that you wear a wrist splint for the next few days, especially when you're doing activities that aggravate your symptoms. You can purchase one at most pharmacies. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
