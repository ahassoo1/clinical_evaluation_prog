DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received a letter regarding some test results from a GI examination I had done recently, and it indicated some… abnormalities. I must admit, I was a bit concerned, and that’s why I scheduled this appointment. I’d be grateful if you could explain what those results mean, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A letter from the GI specialist… I see. And you’re concerned about the abnormalities noted. Do you recall what specifically the letter mentioned?
PATIENT: Let me see… it wasn’t terribly specific, to be honest. I recall something about… inflammation, and a slightly irregular shape in the lower part of my digestive tract. And a note about needing further investigation. It was quite a bit of medical wording, I confess, and I didn’t understand the majority of it. That's why I came to you – to get a clearer explanation. Do you have access to the report itself, Doctor? Perhaps that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, let me pull up the report now. Ah, here we are. Denis Minatra, August 2nd, 2025… Yes, I see the findings from Dr. Ramirez’s office. It does mention inflammation in the sigmoid colon and a… polyp noted during the colonoscopy. A polyp is a growth, Ms. Minatra. They're fairly common, though it's important to determine what kind of polyp it is. Do you have any family history of colon cancer or polyps?
PATIENT: A growth… Oh dear. No, Doctor, to my knowledge, there’s no family history of anything like that. My mother passed away from pneumonia, and my father… well, he was lost in an accident when I was quite young. I don’t recall any mentions of such things on either side of the family. It’s a bit unsettling to hear, frankly. Is this something I should be very worried about? I’m perhaps being dramatic, but it’s difficult not to be anxious when one hears about growths…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to be anxious, Ms. Minatra. We're going to approach this systematically. Most polyps are benign – harmless. However, some can become cancerous over time, which is why we investigate. The report indicates this polyp was approximately 8 millimeters in size. Size does correlate with risk, but isn't the only factor. Did Dr. Ramirez take any biopsies during the colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe he did. I remember something about a small clip being taken… a tissue sample, I think he called it. It wasn't particularly painful, just a bit of discomfort afterwards. He said he would send the results to my general practitioner, who then forwarded the letter to me. I assume the report you’re looking at includes those biopsy findings, then? Are they available, Doctor? I’m terribly curious – and a bit frightened, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are… The pathology report confirms the presence of tubular adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. That means the polyp is a type that can become cancerous over time, Ms. Minatra, but currently shows only early changes. The dysplasia is low-grade, which is… less concerning than high-grade, but it does require follow-up. We’ll need to schedule a repeat colonoscopy in one year to monitor it. And I recommend discussing with a gastroenterologist the possibility of a polypectomy—surgical removal—sooner, rather than later. It's a simple procedure, usually done during a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A polypectomy… another procedure. I confess, Doctor, I'm not a fan of these things. Though I understand, if it prevents something more serious, it’s probably best. So, to be clear, this isn’t cancer now, but it could become cancer if left unattended? And the repeat colonoscopy is to watch for changes? This low-grade dysplasia… is that something common? I feel like I’m asking a great many questions, and I apologize if I’m being difficult. I simply want to understand everything as clearly as possible.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Ms. Minatra. It's good to ask questions. In fact, I expect them. You are correct—currently, there is no evidence of cancer. The dysplasia indicates precancerous changes, essentially. The polyp itself hasn’t become malignant, but has the potential to do so. Low-grade dysplasia is fairly common, thankfully. It's often found during routine colonoscopies. The repeat colonoscopy is to monitor for progression – to see if the dysplasia worsens or if new polyps develop. Now, given your age—67—and the fact that you are currently asymptomatic, we can proceed with surveillance. However, I also want to discuss your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's… somewhat reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. Asymptomatic, yes, that is correct. I have been quite healthy, all things considered. Though… …my eyesight has been deteriorating somewhat in recent years. I wear glasses, as you’ve observed, and the prescription keeps needing adjustments. Other than that… I do have a touch of arthritis in my hands, which flares up occasionally, but it’s manageable with over-the-counter remedies. And I'm widowed, Doctor, if that’s relevant. My husband passed away five years ago. I have no other significant medical history, I believe. Do you require any further information regarding my lifestyle? Diet, exercise…?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Widowed, arthritis, deteriorating eyesight… all noted. Lifestyle is pertinent, yes. Let’s start with diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you, Ms. Minatra?
PATIENT: Well, I do most of my own cooking. I’ve always enjoyed it, though it can be a bit lonely these days. Usually, I have a light breakfast – perhaps some toast with a little jam and a cup of tea. Lunch is typically a simple salad or a sandwich – nothing too elaborate. And for dinner… I try to have something with a good amount of protein and vegetables. Perhaps grilled fish with steamed broccoli, or a chicken stir-fry. I do enjoy sweets, I confess – a small piece of chocolate after dinner is a bit of a habit. I drink plenty of water throughout the day, and I haven’t smoked or consumed alcohol in many years. Is that sufficient information, Doctor? I attempt to maintain a healthy diet, but I’m not particularly strict about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good, a balanced diet overall. No smoking or alcohol is excellent. And regarding exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… that is where I fall a little short, Doctor. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s become a bit difficult with my arthritis. I do a bit of walking, perhaps a short stroll around the neighborhood a few times a week, but it’s not terribly strenuous. I'm not very active, I’m afraid. I spend most of my time indoors, reading or doing crossword puzzles. It's a rather sedentary lifestyle, I confess. I should probably make more of an effort, but… it’s easier said than done, at my age. Is that a concern, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is something to address, Ms. Minatra. Even moderate exercise can be beneficial, especially given your age. It can aid digestion, help manage arthritis, and improve overall health. We don't need to start with strenuous activity, just incorporating more movement into your daily routine. Now, let’s talk about insurance. You mentioned earlier that you were not insured. Do you have any resources available to help cover the cost of the polypectomy and repeat colonoscopy?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. My husband and I had some savings, but they were largely depleted by medical expenses towards the end of his life. And I… I didn’t qualify for any assistance programs. I’m afraid I’m on a fixed income, and the cost of healthcare is… daunting. I had hoped my general practitioner would have a solution, but… she recommended I consult with you. I hadn’t anticipated such significant expenses, and I’m not sure how I will manage. I apologize for the financial burden. I wish I had better news.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Minatra. Healthcare costs are a significant concern for many patients, especially those on fixed incomes. Let me see if I can locate any local resources that might be able to assist you. There are a few programs available in the rural area—a charitable fund with some coverage, a free clinic with limited resources, and perhaps we can work with the gastroenterologist’s office to explore payment options. I will have my assistant prepare a list of these resources for you. In the meantime, let’s focus on scheduling the polypectomy. Do you have a preference for which gastroenterologist you’d like to see?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor, thank you so much. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. As for a gastroenterologist, my general practitioner recommended Dr. Alvarez. She said he has a good reputation and is very thorough. I have no objections, if he is available. I am happy to follow your recommendation, Doctor, as I trust your judgement. I simply wish to address this matter as soon as possible. I am grateful for your kindness and assistance.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Dr. Alvarez is a good choice. I'll have my assistant schedule a consultation for you with him right away. She’ll also provide you with the list of resources for financial assistance. We'll get the repeat colonoscopy scheduled for a year out, contingent on Dr. Alvarez's findings. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, incorporating some gentle exercise when possible, and contacting my office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or rectal bleeding. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve addressed all of my concerns. You’ve been most thorough and patient. I am truly grateful for your kindness and assistance. I feel much more at ease now, knowing that we have a plan in place. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. Please extend my thanks to your assistant as well, for their assistance. I will contact my general practitioner to inform her of our discussion. And I will, of course, contact your office if any new symptoms arise. Thank you once more. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the future. My assistant will be in touch shortly with the appointment information and resources. Have a good day. .
