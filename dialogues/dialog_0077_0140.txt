DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's rather inconvenient to be here, but my wife insisted. It's… a bit embarrassing, really. I have something going on in my mouth. A white coating, mostly on my tongue. It's… unpleasant. I haven’t a clue what it is, and frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be unsettling, Mr. Schieber, and I appreciate you coming in despite your busy schedule. It's good you're addressing it. A white coating on the tongue… alright. Has this been happening long?
PATIENT: Oh, I don't know… a week, maybe? Possibly longer. It’s not as if I spend my days examining my tongue, Doctor. It just… appeared. And it hasn’t gotten better, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s just… there. Is it contagious? My wife would have my hide if I gave her something.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not spending one’s time scrutinizing one's tongue is perfectly normal. And your wife's concern is sensible. Contagious is a good question. It could be several things, Mr. Schieber. Let's try to narrow it down. Does it cause you any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Pain? Doctor, I fall trees for a living. A little white coating isn’t going to cause me pain. It’s… annoying, perhaps. A slight burning sensation sometimes, but nothing I can’t ignore. Really, I’m not one to complain easily. Is it something serious? Because if it’s not, I’d like to be on my way. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain, just a slight burning sensation. I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Schieber. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what, Doctor? I haven’t suddenly sprouted feathers! No, I haven’t noticed anything else particularly. Perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but that’s likely from the heat. I work outdoors, you see. It's August. It's hot. Are you asking if I have a fever? Because I haven't checked. I don’t go around taking my temperature for no reason.
DOCTOR: No, not a fever necessarily. Just… any changes in your appetite, or difficulty tasting things?
PATIENT: Appetite is fine. I eat plenty. As for tasting… well, food tastes like food. I'm not a gourmet, Doctor, I don’t need to distinguish between subtle flavors. I eat to live, not live to eat. Honestly, are you going to examine my mouth or just ask me endless questions? I really haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schieber. Apologies. Let's have a look. Could you please open wide and say "ah"?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Get it over with. I have timber to sort.
DOCTOR: Alright… yes, I see a fairly thick, white coating covering much of the tongue. It doesn’t appear to be easily scraped off. No obvious lesions or redness. Mr. Schieber, your oral mucosa appears normal aside from the coating. Your lymph nodes don't seem swollen. Let's rule out some possibilities. Do you use any kind of mouthwash?
PATIENT: Mouthwash? No. Why would I use mouthwash? I’ve always just… brushed my teeth. Is that even relevant? This is ridiculous. My wife is going to be furious if I’m here much longer. She’s relying on me. Is this something… serious? Or can I just ignore it and hope it goes away? I really need a straight answer.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. It could be a number of things. Given your history and the appearance, it's likely oral thrush – a fungal infection. It's not usually serious, particularly in otherwise healthy individuals. However, it can be uncomfortable, and we should confirm it. I'd like to take a quick swab to send to the lab, just to be certain. It's a simple procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? More poking and prodding? Fine. Get it over with. But if this takes much longer, I’m leaving. Honestly, Doctor, I have a business to run. And tell me straight, is this going to require… medication? Because if it is, I really don’t have time for that. My wife handles the health insurance, and… well, let’s just say it’s complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright, that was quick. It shouldn’t take more than a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, while we wait for the lab results, I can offer you a provisional diagnosis of oral thrush, as I mentioned. It's often treated with an antifungal mouthwash or lozenge. If it is thrush, that's a relatively simple treatment. Given your concerns about insurance, we can discuss some over-the-counter options as well, if that's preferable. Would you like me to write you a prescription, just in case, or should we wait for the lab results?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… that sounds… preferable. I don’t want to get involved in a whole insurance mess. What does this “over-the-counter” stuff involve? And how long until I see some improvement? Because if I’m still dealing with this white coating in a week, I’m going to be very unhappy. And tell me… is it contagious? I really don’t want to give this to my wife. She’s already been giving me grief about spending time at the clinic. .
DOCTOR: Alright, here's a handout with information about over-the-counter treatments for oral thrush, specifically lozenges containing clotrimazole. They usually take a few days to show improvement, but it's important to continue the treatment for the full course, even if you feel better. And regarding your wife, thrush isn't highly contagious, but it can be spread through saliva. So, avoiding sharing utensils and close contact, like kissing, for a few days would be advisable. We'll follow up once the lab results come in, just to confirm. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
