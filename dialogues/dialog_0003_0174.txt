DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I am Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s…well, it’s been a bit of everything lately. I don’t quite know where to begin, to be frank. I suppose…just not feeling myself. I haven’t been happy in a long time, and it’s…wearing me down. I’d really like to get this sorted, if you don’t mind my saying. I haven’t got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Not feeling yourself.” Vague, unfortunately. And time is certainly…valuable. Let’s try to be precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise…yes, of course. It's just…difficult to put into words. It's not a physical thing, you see. My body is…fine, mostly. It's more…an emptiness, I suppose. A lack of…joy. Everything feels…flat. And I've been sleeping poorly. Not nightmares, just…restless. I toss and turn. Is that…precise enough? I really don’t understand why you need so much detail.
DOCTOR: “Flat,” and “restless.” Still…not particularly helpful. When did you begin noticing this “flatness,” Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I begin…? That's a difficult question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It sort of…crept up on me. Perhaps…six months ago? Around the time of my grandson's birthday, I believe. Yes, that sounds right. After the party. Though, even before that, things weren't quite…right. It's all a bit muddled, if I’m honest. I apologize for not being more…organized.
DOCTOR: Six months…and preceding that, a gradual decline. Do you find yourself withdrawing from social activities, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Withdrawing…? Yes, I suppose I have. Not intentionally, you understand. It's just…what's the point? My friends…they don’t really understand. They talk about their grandchildren, their gardens…and I just…smile and nod. It's easier than explaining. And honestly? I haven't the energy for explanations. I used to enjoy my book club, but I haven't gone in months. Everything feels like…effort. A very great effort.
DOCTOR: And has this withdrawal been accompanied by any changes in your appetite, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Appetite…? Hmm. Now that you mention it, yes. I haven’t been eating properly. Not much of an appetite, really. I used to love cooking, Nigerian food especially, but these days…I just pick at things. A little soup, perhaps. A biscuit. Nothing substantial. My daughter keeps bringing me food, but I just don’t want it. It’s not that it doesn't taste good, it just…doesn't appeal. Is that what you're asking? I really wish we could hurry this along a bit, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite, social withdrawal, changes in mood…and for how long exactly has this loss of appetite been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, about as long as the…flatness, I suppose. Six months, give or take. Maybe a little longer with the appetite. I've just…not been myself, as I said before. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when things changed. It wasn't a sudden drop, you understand, it was…gradual. Like a slow leak. And I'm not the type to bother people with…feelings. So I just…kept to myself. I really don't understand why this is taking so long. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Derasmo, I am documenting everything. Now, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Hopelessness…yes. Perhaps. Not in a…dramatic way, you understand. More like…what’s the point of anything? I used to have such plans, such energy. Now…it all seems rather futile. As for…self-harm…no. Never. That’s a dreadful thought. I’ve never even considered such a thing. Absolutely not. Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather…intrusive. I came here because I’m unhappy, not because I’m… unwell in that way.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your medical history…are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Let me see…Just the usual things. For my blood pressure, a small dose. And sometimes a pain reliever for my arthritis. Nothing serious, you understand. Just the aches and pains of getting older. I'll have to check the names, to be honest. I leave all that to my daughter. She keeps track of everything. I truly don't understand why you need to know all these details. It's my feelings that matter, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Knowing your medications is crucial, Mrs. Derasmo, to avoid potential interactions. Do you recall the names of these medications, even approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I really don't. One is a small white pill, I think. The other is a pink capsule. My daughter has a list. She’s far more organized than I am. It's… Lisinopril, I believe, for the blood pressure. And…Naproxen for the arthritis. Is that sufficient? I truly don’t see the point of recalling every little detail. It’s wasting both our time. I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergic…? No, not that I know of. I’ve never had any…reactions, you understand. My daughter always checks when she gets my prescriptions. She's very careful. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like you are questioning my very sanity here. I'm just a little…down. I'm not a complicated case. Are we nearly finished? I have to pick up my grandson later.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, based on what you’ve described – prolonged sadness, loss of appetite, social withdrawal – it’s possible you are experiencing symptoms of depression. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying physical causes. And I would strongly recommend a referral to a psychiatrist for a more thorough evaluation.
PATIENT: Depression…? Oh, honestly. I simply haven’t been feeling myself. It's a temporary thing, I assure you. Blood work and a…psychiatrist…? That seems…rather extreme, don’t you think? I don't need a psychiatrist! I just need a little…encouragement, perhaps. Or a nice long rest. Honestly, Doctor, I’m perfectly capable of sorting myself out. I've lived a long and full life. I don't need labels and…specialists. I think I'll just go home now and have a cup of tea. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Derasmo. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider the referral. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please contact my office immediately. Here's a prescription for a mild sleep aid, to assist with your restlessness. And a number for a local support group, should you change your mind. .
