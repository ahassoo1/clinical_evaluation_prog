DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Nestingen. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well, now, let me think… it’s me ears, I reckon. They just don't work like they used to. Everything's a bit muffled, ya know? Not awful, just… quieter. I have trouble hearin’ folks sometimes.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, alright. And you've noticed this…when exactly did you start noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Seems like…a while now. Not all at once, more like it just slowly crept up on me. Maybe a year or so? It's hard to say, really. Time kinda gets away from ya when you get to be my age, ya know?
DOCTOR: A year…gradual onset. Alright. Have you noticed it's worse in certain situations?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… yes, I suppose so. Big crowds are a bit of a nightmare. And when folks don’t look at me when they’re talkin’. Makes it even harder to pick up what they’re sayin’. Quiet places are better, naturally. But even then, sometimes it's just… faint.
DOCTOR: Worse with background noise and when you can't see the speaker's face. Okay. Now, have you ever had any ringing in your ears, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that is a good question. Let me think… sometimes, yeah, I think I do. Like a high-pitched whine, but it's not constant. Comes and goes. Mostly when things are very quiet, I reckon. It doesn't bother me too much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Intermittent tinnitus. Alright. And have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises – perhaps at work, or hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, work, yes. I worked in a shoe factory for… Lord, must be fifty years or more. Lots of machines, lots of noise. Clatterin’ and thumpin’ all day long. They didn’t give us much ear protection back then, not like they do now. Hobbies… not much, really. Just liked to garden a bit. That wasn’t too loud.
DOCTOR: Prolonged noise exposure during your employment. That’s helpful. Now, let’s do a quick exam of your ears. Just want to take a look, make sure there isn't anything obvious going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. Just let me know if it’ll be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. This won’t be painful, just a little cool. I’m going to look in your ear canals. Hmm. Mild cerumen impaction in the right ear canal. The tympanic membrane looks a little dull, but otherwise normal. Similar findings in the left ear – mild cerumen buildup and slightly dull tympanic membrane. No obvious signs of infection or structural abnormalities. Okay. It appears you have some wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to your hearing difficulty. It's also possible there's some age-related hearing loss beginning.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? Well, that makes sense, I suppose. Never really paid much attention to cleanin’ ‘em, to be honest. Age-related, you say? Everything goes eventually, don't it? What do you think we should do about it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We can start by removing the wax. It’s a fairly simple procedure. We have a few options: I can manually remove it with special instruments, or we can try some ear drops to soften the wax, and you can gradually work it out at home. I usually recommend the drops first, as it's less invasive. Would you prefer to try the ear drops first, and if that doesn't work, we can consider manual removal?
PATIENT: Oh, the drops sound a lot nicer, thank you. I’d rather not have anything poked around in there, if I can help it. Gentle seems better, at my age. So yes, the drops sounds grand. How do I use 'em, then?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a prescription for some ceruminolytic ear drops - that’s just a fancy word for wax-softening drops. You’ll want to lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Put 5 drops into the ear canal, and gently massage the base of your ear for about a minute. Stay lying on your side for 5-10 minutes to allow the drops to soak in. Do this twice a day for about a week. You may experience some slight bubbling or a temporary feeling of fullness in your ear, that’s normal. If you don’t notice any improvement after a week, or if you experience any pain or discomfort, please call the office, and we can schedule another appointment to discuss other options. Does that sound clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable enough. Twice a day, five drops, massage, lie down… I think I can remember that. And if it hurts, or doesn't work, I call you. Good, good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it so clearly. Is there anything else I should be doin’? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid getting water in your ears while using the drops. And try to avoid using cotton swabs, as those can actually push the wax further into the ear canal. If you feel any blockage or discomfort after starting the drops, stop using them and let us know. Given your age and the gradual onset of hearing loss, I also recommend a hearing test. It will give us a more accurate understanding of your hearing levels and help us determine if you might benefit from a hearing aid in the future. Would you be interested in scheduling that?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Better to know, right? If it shows I need somethin’, then we’ll deal with it. Yes, alright, go ahead and schedule one for me. Whenever’s convenient for you, Doctor. I'm not in a rush.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see… we have an opening next Tuesday at 10:30 AM with our audiologist, Sarah Miller. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten-thirty… yes, that sounds fine. That'll give me plenty of time to get ready. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think that's all I need for today.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. We'll get you scheduled for that hearing test. Here’s a summary of our plan: use the ear drops twice a day for one week, avoid getting water in your ears and using cotton swabs, and attend the hearing test next Tuesday at 10:30 AM with Sarah Miller. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Schneer. Take care. .
PATIENT: Nice meetin’ you too, Doctor. And thank you again for everythin’. I will. You have a good day now.
