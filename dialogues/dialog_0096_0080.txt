DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Good to meet you too, Dr. Burlingham. Well, it's not really a visit, visit. Just need to get some forms filled out for Medicare, you know? They sent 'em in the mail and figured it was easier to do it here if I needed help with anything.
DOCTOR: Medicare forms, eh?
PATIENT: Yep. Lots of questions, and some of 'em...well, they don't quite make sense to me. That's all. I just wanna make sure I get it right. Don't want any trouble with my coverage.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly go through them. Though, honestly, I’m a doctor, not a paperwork specialist. But we'll do our best. Let's start with the first one. Do you have your glasses?
PATIENT: I am wearing 'em! See? Right here on my face. Just sometimes the print is small, you know? And some of the words…they use fancy words for things.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, medical terminology is rather specific. Alright. Let’s start with this first section – it’s about your medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor in the last year?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. I saw Dr. Reynolds back in November for my yearly check-up. Just the usual stuff, blood pressure, weight, you know. Nothing major. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that counts. And did Dr. Reynolds mention anything concerning at that visit?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. He said my blood pressure was a little high, but told me to watch my salt intake and get more exercise. Same old, same old. He didn’t find anything wrong, wrong, just… things to keep an eye on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before that?
PATIENT: Before that…honestly, it’s been a while. I mostly just go when I need to, you know? I don’t really like going to the doctor if I don’t have to. I think maybe… I had my flu shot a couple years back. But I can't remember who gave it to me. It was at a clinic somewhere… not Dr. Reynolds.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's alright. We'll just document what you remember. Now, this next section asks about any surgeries or hospitalizations. Have you ever had any operations or been admitted to the hospital?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery, thank goodness! And I've only been to the hospital once, when I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree, trying to get a kite down. Silly kid stuff. They set the bone, and I was fine. That was… a long time ago. Definitely before I turned ten.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, what about serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… Well, I had pneumonia once, when I was in my twenties. It was pretty bad, I was in bed for a week. But I recovered. Other than that… nothin’ too major, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, this asks about family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mom had… diabetes, I think. She passed away a few years ago. And my dad… he had heart trouble. He passed away when I was pretty young, though, so I don’t remember a whole lot about it. I have one brother, and he's perfectly healthy as far as I know. He lives out in California.
DOCTOR: California, alright. And did your mother or father have any other medical problems that you recall?
PATIENT: Let me think... Mom, she had some trouble with her knees, arthritis, I think. She was always complaining about them. And Dad… honestly, I don’t remember much. He passed when I was only twelve. It was a long time ago. I mostly just remember he didn't feel well a lot, but I was a kid, you know? I didn't really understand what was going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've tried all sorts of things, and never had a reaction. No trouble with penicillin or anything like that, either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, like Dr. Reynolds prescribed. A small white pill. I take it every morning. That's it. Nothing else. I don’t really like taking pills if I don’t need to, you know?
DOCTOR: And what is the name of that medication, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: Oh. Um... Geez, I should know this, shouldn't I? It's... it's a little white pill. I think it starts with an 'A'. Dr. Reynolds just told me to take one every morning with breakfast. I don't really pay attention to the names, just that it helps with my blood pressure. I keep the bottle at home. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, it’s important to know what medications you are taking. Especially the name and dosage. I can’t properly assess your medical history without that information. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: No, I don't. It’s at home. Like I said, I just take what Dr. Reynolds gives me. I figured he'd have it on file here. Is it really that important? I’ve been taking it for months, and I feel fine. Maybe we can just skip that part? I'm really just here to get these forms filled out for Medicare. I don’t like all these questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, with all due respect, these questions are important. You are presenting me with incomplete medical information, and expecting me to sign off on these forms. If something were to happen, and you were unable to tell me what medications you were taking, it could have serious consequences. I need to know the name of that medication. If you don’t know, you’ll need to contact Dr. Reynolds’ office, or go retrieve the bottle. We can reschedule this appointment once you have that information. I understand Medicare forms can be frustrating, but your health is my priority.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right. I'm sorry. I just... I don't like being told what to do, I guess. And I thought Dr. Reynolds would have it all written down. It’s… Amlodipine. That’s it. Amlodipine. Five milligrams, I think. I’ll have to check the bottle to be sure. Is that enough? I really just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, Amlodipine 5mg is good. Thank you, Ms. Fabing. That is much better. Now, about your social history... Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a glass of wine maybe once or twice a year. Usually with dinner. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don't hold with any of that. I like my tea, that’s about it. Helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn't take long. If you’ll just have a seat up there.
PATIENT: Oh. Um… I wasn't expecting that. I thought this was just paperwork. Is it really necessary? I feel fine, you know? I’m really not a fan of doctors, and all that poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, as I've explained, I need to have a complete picture of your health before I can sign off on these forms. A brief physical exam is standard procedure. It allows me to assess your current condition and identify any potential issues. It’s not about "poking and prodding," it’s about providing you with the best possible care. It will only take a few minutes. Please, just let me listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It's for your benefit.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You're right. I just... I don't like doctors. Let's just get it over with. I'm not gonna be happy if you tell me I need to lose weight.
DOCTOR: We'll see, Ms. Fabing. Now, please, have a seat and relax. Deep breaths. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not surprising given your earlier history. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Everything sounds normal at this time, but we should monitor your blood pressure regularly.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that it? Can I go now? I'm starting to feel a little anxious. I really don’t like being poked and prodded, even if you say it’s not poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all for now. Yes, you can go. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, everything appears stable. We'll need to keep an eye on your blood pressure, and I recommend a follow-up appointment in six months. I’m going to write you a prescription refill for your Amlodipine. And I’ll send the completed Medicare forms to their office. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Dr. Burlingham. I appreciate you taking the time to explain things, even if I was being difficult. And thank you for getting these forms done. It was… a process. I’m glad it’s over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. Just remember to schedule that follow-up appointment. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your health. Have a good day. .
