DOCTOR: Hello Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, ringing in the ears, alright. That can be… unsettling. Let's see if we can figure out what’s going on. When you say "a bit now," could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Um, maybe… three weeks? It started quietly, I thought it was just the fan at first, you know? But it hasn’t gone away, and it’s gotten louder, especially at night when it’s quiet. It’s hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks. And it's worse at night… that's helpful. Is it just one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly my right ear, but sometimes I hear it in my left too. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes. Like… waves, almost. Sometimes it's a high-pitched ring, other times more of a buzzing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Waves of ringing, different pitches… alright. Have you noticed anything that triggers it, or makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I dunno. Not really, I don’t think. I work, you know, waiting tables… it’s pretty noisy sometimes in the restaurant. But it started before it got really busy again, so I don’t think that’s it. Maybe when I’m stressed? I got divorced a few months ago… so, yeah, probably stress.
DOCTOR: Right, a lot going on. Stress is definitely a factor we need to consider. Okay, let’s do a quick check of your ears. Just want to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Go ahead. I just hope it’s not something serious. This noise is really getting on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s have a look… Hmm. Your ear canals look clear. No wax buildup, no signs of infection. Eardrums look normal as well. No obvious damage. That's good news. Now, have you noticed any hearing loss, or dizziness along with the ringing?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing seems okay. I can hear everything normally, as far as I can tell. And no dizziness, thankfully. Sometimes I feel a little… off-balance when I stand up too fast, but I always have, so I don't think that's related. It's just my normal clumsiness.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And you mentioned a recent divorce... has there been any significant change in medication, or any head injury recently?
PATIENT: No changes to my meds. I just take a daily vitamin. And no head injuries, thankfully. I’m pretty careful, usually. It was just… a difficult time, a lot of arguing, a lot of sleepless nights… you know? Maybe that’s it? Stress messing with my head.
DOCTOR: Okay. It certainly could be stress-related. Tinnitus – that’s the medical term for ringing in the ears – can be caused by a lot of things, but stress is a common one. Do you have any other symptoms I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. Just tired, I guess. And a bit grumpy. Sorry if I'm being difficult, it's just hard to concentrate when there's this constant noise in my head. Is there anything we can do about it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to apologize at all. It’s completely understandable. Let’s see… Since we've ruled out any obvious physical cause, and you have no other neurological symptoms, it's likely we're dealing with tinnitus potentially linked to stress and possibly some acoustic overload from your work environment. I'm going to recommend a hearing test just to get a baseline and confirm there's no underlying hearing loss we’re missing. And we can discuss some strategies for managing the tinnitus itself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A hearing test is fine. And yeah, any strategies to manage it would be amazing. I'm really hoping it goes away. This is… it’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get you scheduled for a hearing test with our audiologist, Sarah Chen. We can usually get you in within the week. In the meantime, things like relaxation techniques - deep breathing exercises, meditation – can sometimes help. Avoiding loud noises when possible is also a good idea. We can also explore some sound therapy options if the relaxation doesn't help – things like white noise machines or apps. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements besides your daily vitamin?
PATIENT: Just the daily vitamin, like I said. Nothing else. And I try to avoid loud noises at work, but it's hard, you know? It's a restaurant, there's always something going on. Deep breathing... I guess I can try that. I'm not very good at relaxing though. I always feel like I should be doing something.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, it takes practice. We have some resources on relaxation techniques available in the clinic, I'll print you off a handout. I'm also going to write a referral for a short course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy . Sometimes, learning strategies to cope with the perception of the noise can be really helpful, especially given the stressful life event you've recently experienced. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good, actually. CBT, huh? I’ve heard of it. If it helps me deal with the noise, then I’m willing to try anything. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve been really helpful. I feel a bit better just knowing there's something we can do.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I'm glad I could help. To recap, we've scheduled a hearing test for you with Sarah Chen, and I'm writing a referral for a short course of CBT. I’ve also provided you with a handout on relaxation techniques. I’ll also put an order in for a basic blood panel just to rule out any underlying medical causes that could be contributing to the tinnitus. It’s a pretty standard precaution. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Blood panel too, okay. Just want to get to the bottom of this. You’ve really put my mind at ease, Doctor. Thank you. I think that’s everything? Or is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That’s everything for today. The nurse will draw the blood before you leave, and they’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the hearing test results and the CBT referral. If the tinnitus gets significantly worse before your follow-up, or if you develop any other symptoms – dizziness, hearing loss, pain – please give us a call immediately. I think that’s all. Get some rest, and try those breathing exercises. Hopefully, we can get this under control.
