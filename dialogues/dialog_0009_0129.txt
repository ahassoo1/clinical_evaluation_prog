DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Honestly, it’s about my…well, my stool. It’s black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis, pretty regularly. Been happening a bit lately, and frankly, it’s unsettling. I’ve had this happen before, years ago, and it wasn’t good. Don’t really want to bother you with details, but I figured it was worth checking.
DOCTOR: I understand. Black stools can definitely be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It's important to rule out any serious causes, especially given your history and the fact you take pain pills regularly. To start, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the black stools?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates…let me think. It wasn't just yesterday, that's for sure. Probably… maybe a week ago? No, wait. Closer to ten days, I reckon. It's not every time, mind you. Just…sometimes. It's not like it's bright black, either. More…dark. Like very, very dark coffee grounds, if that makes sense. And frankly, I don’t pay attention to every little thing I do in the bathroom, you know? I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Dawnetta. It's very helpful to have even a rough estimate, and "dark, like very dark coffee grounds" is a good description. It sounds like it's been intermittent over the past ten days or so. Now, besides the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes…well, now that you mention it, I suppose it's been a bit… looser than usual. Not full-blown diarrhea, mind you, but not…solid, either. And I’m… regular, usually. Always have been. This is a bit off. Don’t ask me how off, I don’t keep a logbook, Doctor! Honestly, do you expect me to examine everything? Some things are best left unsaid. I just want to make sure it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Dawnetta, I don’t expect you to examine everything! I just need to gather enough information to understand what’s going on. “Looser than usual” is good to know. Have you noticed any blood in your stool – bright red blood, or anything darker mixed in with it?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Absolutely not. I would know if there was blood. That would be…alarming. None whatsoever. I’m telling you, it’s just dark. Like I said, dark coffee grounds. And it comes and goes. It's not like there's a constant stream of… well, you get the picture. I take my pain pills, and that’s all I’m saying. Could be related, right? They mess with everything, those things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no blood. And yes, pain medications can definitely affect the digestive system. Now, let's talk about those pain pills. What medication are you taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s…Naproxen, I think? Yes, Naproxen. And I take… two in the morning, and two at night. Sometimes three at night if my arthritis is really acting up. Doctor, honestly, I don’t measure everything perfectly. It depends on the pain, you see? If it hurts, I take one more. It's not an exact science. They're supposed to help, but…well, everything has a downside, doesn't it? And I’m starting to think this black stool is the downside.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen, two twice a day, and up to three at night as needed for arthritis pain. That's helpful information. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, where to begin? Arthritis, obviously, that’s why I’m on the pills. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. It’s controlled with… a little white pill, I think. And… I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. No problems with that since. And I suppose that’s it. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know? I’m not made of iron. Honestly, Doctor, are we done soon? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're making good progress. Arthritis, high blood pressure, and gallbladder removal – thank you. And I appreciate your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, another thing? Honestly, Doctor. Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke and prod too much, alright? I bruise easily, you know. And I don't want to be walking around like a pincushion all day. Just make it quick. I really do have things to do. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Dawnetta. I'll be very gentle. Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now... Your abdomen is soft, and I don't hear any unusual sounds. There is no tenderness to light palpation. I don’t feel any masses. Everything seems normal, but that doesn't rule things out. Now, given your history of taking Naproxen, the intermittent dark stools, and the fact that you’ve experienced this before, my concern is that this could be bleeding in your upper gastrointestinal tract. Naproxen, like other NSAIDs, can sometimes cause stomach irritation and bleeding. The dark, coffee-ground-like stools are a sign of partially digested blood. However, we need to confirm this. I’d like to order a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to see if you’re anemic. We may also need to consider an upper endoscopy if the stool test is positive or if your symptoms worsen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, bleeding? See, I knew it was something serious! Endoscopy… that sounds dreadful! I had a friend who had one of those… not a pleasant experience, I can tell you. Look, Doctor, can’t we just… stop the pain pills? Will that fix it? I’m willing to suffer a little if it means avoiding all those tests and procedures. Honestly, I don’t want any poking around inside me. And suffering a little is better than all this… drama. So, can’t we just try stopping the pills first? And if it doesn’t work, then maybe we talk about the tests. But please, no endoscopy. That sounds awful. Just… stop the pills first. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about the endoscopy, and I respect your wishes. It’s certainly reasonable to try stopping the Naproxen first, given your concerns and the potential for it to be the cause of the bleeding. We can absolutely try stopping the Naproxen. However, it's important to understand that stopping it suddenly can sometimes cause withdrawal symptoms or a flare-up of your arthritis pain. I’ll write you a prescription for a different pain reliever – something milder, like acetaminophen – to help manage your pain while you’re tapering off the Naproxen. I also want you to monitor your stools closely. If you notice any bright red blood, or if the dark stools continue or worsen after a week of stopping the Naproxen, it's very important to contact me immediately. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss your symptoms and see how you’re doing. If the symptoms persist or worsen, we may need to reconsider the stool test or endoscopy. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… that’s the stuff for headaches, right? Well, it’s better than nothing, I suppose. A week… alright. A week of monitoring. And if it gets worse, I contact you. Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Finally. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate you listening to me. I just want to feel better, and I don’t want a lot of unnecessary poking and prodding. And please, write down those instructions clearly, alright? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. And I don’t want to forget anything. A week, monitor the stools, acetaminophen… and contact you if it gets worse. Right? Now, can we get this prescription sorted? And then I can be on my way? I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dawnetta. I'm happy to accommodate your wishes and glad we could come to a plan you're comfortable with. Here’s the prescription for the acetaminophen, and this instruction sheet summarizes everything we discussed – the symptoms to watch for, the medication dosage, and my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ve also noted in your chart that we’ve discussed the possibility of a stool test or endoscopy if your symptoms don’t improve. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Honestly, Doctor, thank you. You’ve been very helpful. And I really appreciate you not pushing for all those tests right away. I think I’m good to go now. I have a lot to do. And I promise to monitor those stools… and contact you if anything gets worse. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dawnetta. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you next week. .
