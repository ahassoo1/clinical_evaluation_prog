DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve got the hiccups. And they won’t stop. It’s been over two days now.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Just… hiccups. I’ve tried everything I could think of. Drinking water really fast, holding my breath… even getting someone to scare me! Nothing seems to work. It’s just… hic… going on and on. It’s tiring, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can be quite disruptive, and exhausting as you said. Two days is… longer than most hiccups last. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on. Can you tell me a little bit more about when they started?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… It was Sunday, I believe. I was at a friend’s barbecue. I laughed really hard at something – honestly, it was a silly joke – and then hic… they just started. I didn’t think much of it at first, you know? Hiccups come and go. But they haven't gone. It’s just been… hic… constant since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started after a good laugh at a barbecue on Sunday. And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms alongside the hiccups, have you?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I’m a little tired because of them, but that’s it. No pain, no shortness of breath, no… hic… anything else unusual. Just the hiccups. I ate a normal amount at the barbecue, nothing out of the ordinary. I had some chicken, salad, a little potato… nothing spicy or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had hiccups like this before, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: No, never this long. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, you know? But they always stop after a few minutes. Maybe an hour, tops. This is… hic… completely different. It’s really strange. I'm starting to worry a little bit, if I’m honest. It just doesn’t seem normal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Prolonged hiccups can be a little unusual, and it's good you're seeking medical attention. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just feel around your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want them to stop, honestly. It's… hic… really getting on my nerves. I’m happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Here we go. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. hic... I hope you find something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I’m not detecting anything concerning. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Respiratory rate is 16, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. hic… You seem otherwise well. Did you experience any recent weight loss or changes in your diet, aside from the barbecue?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss. My appetite is normal, I think. hic… I haven't really changed my diet, no. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Chicken, fish, vegetables… mostly Egyptian food, to be honest. I cook a lot at home. Everything’s normal… or was normal, until these hiccups started! Do you think… hic… it could be something serious? I worry a lot. My mother always said… well, never mind. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're sharing all of this with me, Ms. Redeye. It's unlikely to be something serious, but prolonged hiccups can sometimes be a sign of an underlying issue, even if it's uncommon. Given the duration, and since the simple remedies haven't worked, I think we should run a few basic tests, just to be on the safe side. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and perhaps a chest x-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help figure out what's going on, then yes, please. I just want them to stop. hic… I'm starting to feel ridiculous. What does the chest x-ray look for, exactly? Is it to see if something is… pressing on my diaphragm? I hope it's not anything bad.
DOCTOR: We’ll check for a variety of things with the chest x-ray. Yes, we will look to see if anything is pressing on your diaphragm, but also to rule out any issues with your lungs or heart. It's a routine precaution, Ms. Redeye. The blood tests will give us a better idea of your overall health and identify any potential imbalances. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye or any other medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I haven’t had much need for medication, thankfully. I’m usually quite healthy. hic… just this. This awful hiccup. So, where do we do these tests? Is it here, in the clinic? And will I need an appointment? I don't like waiting around.
DOCTOR: We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic, yes. The chest x-ray will require a visit to the imaging center across town. I'll have my assistant schedule those for you now. She’ll work with your schedule. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, if the hiccups become severe or if you experience any new symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or vomiting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Emergency room if anything gets worse. Okay. Good. hic… I’m glad we’re doing something. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully, we’ll find out what’s causing this soon. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any special diet, or anything?
DOCTOR: For now, there's no need for a special diet. Continue eating a normal, healthy diet. Avoid carbonated beverages, as they can sometimes worsen hiccups. And try to avoid sudden changes in temperature. Otherwise, just try to rest and stay hydrated. My assistant will be in shortly with the paperwork for the tests. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. I appreciate your help. hic... I just want to be able to eat a meal without sounding like a broken accordion. I’ll see your assistant.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand your frustration. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
