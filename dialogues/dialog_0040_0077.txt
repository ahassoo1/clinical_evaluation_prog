DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Bigger, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Delmon Bigger. And you are…? You look…young for a doctor. Not that’s a bad thing, mind you. Just…surprising.
DOCTOR: Dr. Osga. Sam Osga. And yes, well, people often say that. Now, let’s not dwell on my age, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmph. Alright, alright. Just saying. So, what exactly are we doing here today? My son, he filled out all these papers. Too many questions, if you ask me. I feel fine, perfectly fine. Been working hard all my life, never had time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Well, your son clearly has concerns, and filling out paperwork is part of the process. But alright. "Perfectly fine," you say?
PATIENT: Perfectly fine! I told him. He worries too much. Always has. Something about the dust at the mine, he said. Dust! I've been breathing dust for fifty years! Never killed me yet. What kind of dust is so special now? It’s not like I’m coughing up my lungs, or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no cough?
PATIENT: No cough! I just told you! Look, I come here because he makes me. He pays for the insurance, so I humor him. He keeps talking about “evaluation” and “exposure.” Sounds like a lot of nonsense to me. I need to get back to my garden, you know. Tomatoes don't grow themselves.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, let's just go through the motions, then. Fifty years in the mine…what exactly did you do in the mine?
PATIENT: Loading and moving. Big machines. Digging things out. I operated them. Made good money, good money. Not fancy work, but honest work. Been doing it since I was a young man. What good will knowing all that do? It’s not like I wanted to be breathing dust, but I needed to feed my family.
DOCTOR: It's relevant, Mr. Bigger. Now, any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No! I walk to the market every week, don’t I? Up and down those hills. It’s… strenuous, maybe. But I don’t go collapsing or anything. You think I'd be here talking to you if I couldn't breathe? Use your head. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And any wheezing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What is wheezing? Sounds like a cat. I haven’t been wheezing. I breathe. In and out. That’s it. This is a waste of my time. And yours, probably. My tomatoes are going to be overripe at this rate.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? I’m eighty-six years old! What do you expect, to be bouncing off the walls? I get tired, of course. But I always get tired. That’s just getting old. It doesn't mean the dust is doing something special. I still work in my garden. I still manage. I’m not laying in bed all day, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see here your son mentioned some…chest tightness?
PATIENT: Chest tightness? He said that? That boy! Probably something I said, arguing about him spending too much money. My chest gets tight when I’m upset, not from dust! He always exaggerates everything. Always has. Makes a mountain out of a molehill, that one. It’s probably heartburn, if anything. From the spicy food my daughter-in-law makes. Not dust. Definitely not dust.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Deep breath? Fine. But don’t expect anything. You’re going to hear old lungs. Lungs that have seen things. Lungs that have earned their rest. inhales deeply, then exhales with a slight cough There. Happy? Now can I go?
DOCTOR: I do hear some diminished breath sounds, particularly on the lower lobes. And a slight…wheeze, actually. Though faint. It could be a number of things. Now, do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? Pneumonia? Good heavens, no! I haven’t got time for fancy illnesses. I told you, I worked hard all my life. No time to be sick. My mother, she had something with her chest when I was a boy. But that was a long time ago, and I didn’t catch it. I was a strong boy. I never had any of those…things. This is all nonsense. I’m telling you. Dust! It’s just old age and a little bit of stress from my son worrying too much. That's all it is. Now, can we be done here?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. We'll get some imaging done – a chest X-ray, just to rule things out. And I'll order a pulmonary function test. It will give us a better idea of how well your lungs are working. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Imaging? Tests? More waiting around? Look, I appreciate…well, I guess I appreciate you trying to figure things out. But frankly, I don't like the sound of any of this. Is it absolutely necessary? I feel fine. Mostly. My son will be happy, I suppose. If it makes him stop worrying. Fine. Do the tests. But if they tell you it’s just old age, I’m not coming back. And tell that machine operator to hurry up, I’ve got tomatoes to tend to. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I’ll have the nurse schedule those tests for you. We’ll get you in and out as quickly as possible. Try not to overexert yourself until we have the results. And, yes, I’ll tell the operator to hurry. .
