DOCTOR: Hi Venna, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s why I’m here. My son, Dale, told me I needed to get it checked. He worries somethin’ awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good Dale is looking out for you. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to keep an eye on. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “actin’ up”?
PATIENT: Well, I get these headaches sometimes, mostly in the back of my head. And I feel kinda dizzy when I stand up too fast. Not all the time, just sometimes. It’s been goin’ on for…oh, I don’t know, a couple months now, maybe longer. It's hard to remember these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be tricky to keep track of things. Headaches and dizziness can certainly be related to blood pressure. And you're right to bring it up. Do the headaches feel constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, mostly. Not every day. Some days I feel fine, and other days… well, they just kinda bother me off and on. It’s not a real sharp pain, more like a… a pressure, I guess. Like somethin’s tight around my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure-like headache. And you mentioned the dizziness when you stand up quickly. Does anything else bring on the dizziness, or does it only happen with standing?
PATIENT: Just standin’ mostly. Sometimes when I bend over too fast too, but mostly when I stand. I try to take it slow, but sometimes I forget and… whoosh… there it is. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But it’s enough to make me grab onto somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not really. I wear glasses, you know, for readin’ mostly. They work fine. I don't think my vision’s gotten any worse. Everything looks kinda blurry up close without 'em, always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, my arthritis acts up sometimes, in my hands mostly. Makes it hard to knead dough, which is a shame, seein' as I’m a baker. And I had a bad bout of the flu a couple winters ago, but I got over it. Other than that… nothin' major, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and a past case of the flu. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a young woman, I had my tonsils taken out. A long time ago now. And I was in the hospital when I had my son, Dale, but that weren't a surgery, just…havin’ a baby. Other than that, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mama… she had a bad heart. Passed away when she was pretty young, not even sixty. And my brother, he had… what was it? Diabetes, I think. He wasn't too good at takin' care of himself, poor thing. Lots of sugar in his tea, he always said.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your brother. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m workin’ with flour, but that's just from the dust, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s called… Ibuprofen, I think. Dale gets it for me. And sometimes I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, ‘cause I don’t get out in the sun much. Other than that, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ibuprofen for arthritis and Vitamin D. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just don't poke me too much, alright?
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Venna. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Here you go, Doctor. Hope it’s not too high. Dale’s been givin’ me the side-eye somethin’ fierce lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 162 over 94. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds a little… robust, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, but you do have some mild wheezing. I also noticed some swelling in your ankles. Is that normal for you?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, yes, sometimes. Mostly at the end of the day. I’ve always been a bit prone to it. Dale says it's ‘cause I’m on my feet too much, bakin’ all day. He keeps tellin’ me to put my feet up, but… well, there’s always orders to fill, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand. Being on your feet a lot can certainly cause swelling. Venna, based on what you've told me and the exam, your blood pressure is elevated, and the wheezing and swelling suggest some potential underlying issues. It's unlikely to be an emergency, but we definitely need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete metabolic panel. I also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like… a lot. Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I just wanted to get my blood pressure checked, not… all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venna. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize if it's overwhelming. It’s not necessarily serious, but it’s important to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Elevated blood pressure can lead to heart problems, kidney issues, and stroke if left untreated, and the wheezing could indicate something going on with your lungs. These tests will help us determine the cause and create a plan to get you feeling better. It's better to be proactive and catch things early. We can discuss all the results and options thoroughly before making any decisions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Well… if you think it's best. Dale would want me to get it checked out, I suppose. He’s always worryin’ about me. Alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. But please, explain everything to me afterwards, alright? I don’t understand all that fancy medical talk.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I promise to explain everything in plain English, and I won't move forward with any treatments without your full understanding and consent. I'll also make sure Dale is involved if you'd like. Okay, let me get the lab orders and EKG requisition for you. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will draw some blood. Then, we'll do the EKG right here in the room. It's a painless test where we put some sticky pads on your chest. It will take just a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And will it cost a lot of money? My insurance is…okay, but… well, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The lab results usually come back within a couple of days, so I should have them for you by next week. As for the cost, it will depend on your insurance coverage, but we have a billing department that can help you understand the costs and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. They can also check what your insurance will cover beforehand. I'll have the nurse provide you with their contact information before you leave. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. The more information we have, the better we can help you. I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and set up the EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds fine. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins aren't always easy to find. And thank you, Doctor. For explainin' everything so clearly, and for not makin' me feel like an old fool.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. I’m happy to help. And I will certainly let the nurse know to be gentle. She’s very skilled and experienced. I’ll let her know about your veins. I’ll leave you to get ready, and I'll check back in with you after the tests are done. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The nurse will be in shortly. And again, thank you for coming in today. It takes courage to address these concerns, and I appreciate you trusting me with your health.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I reckon it’s best to know what’s goin’ on, even if it ain’t good news.
