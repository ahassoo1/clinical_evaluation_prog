DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… my stomach. Been having problems for weeks now. Just… constant diarrhea. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? It just keeps happening. It’s really inconvenient, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Constant diarrhea” for weeks… that is inconvenient, and certainly not something you want to deal with. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say "weeks," roughly how long?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I've lost track. Maybe… six weeks? Seven? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, lurking. It’s not like a one-time thing. It’s just…persistent. I really don’t see what’s taking so long to figure this out, it’s not like it’s a mystery illness.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent diarrhea for approximately six to seven weeks. And you’ve tried some over-the-counter remedies, you mentioned. Can you tell me what specifically you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Well, I tried… Immodium, I guess? And something with bismuth, like for upset stomach. Pink stuff. I don’t really pay attention to names, I just grab whatever the pharmacist recommends. It helps for, like, an hour maybe, and then it’s right back to… well, you know. It's not exactly effective, and frankly, it’s embarrassing to even be talking about this.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing, Ms. Woodring, but that's why you’re here, and we’ll figure this out. It sounds like those medications haven’t provided lasting relief. Have you noticed anything with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Like… what do you mean? Look, it’s just…diarrhea. What else would there be? It's not like it comes with a party favor. But… okay, fine. Sometimes there’s… cramps, I guess. And I've been really tired lately, but I figured that’s just…life. Does that answer your question? I really don't like dwelling on this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Cramps and fatigue… okay. And is there any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Don’t ask me that. Really? That's a terribly rude question. I came in here because I have a stomach problem, not… that. Are you even a real doctor? It’s…disgusting to even ask.
DOCTOR: Oh, my apologies, Ms. Woodring. That was… poorly worded. I assure you, I am a doctor. It's a standard question to rule out certain causes, but I understand your discomfort. We don’t need to discuss it further. Let me ask this instead: Have you noticed any fever, or chills?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. Honestly, I just want something to stop it. I’ve got things to do, you know? I’m a painter, I need to be… functional. This is cutting into my work. Is it possible you could just… prescribe something stronger? I don't have time for tests, I need a solution, not a scientific investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand you're frustrated and need a solution quickly, Ms. Woodring. Before prescribing anything, though, I need a little more information to ensure I'm not masking a more serious problem. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Look, maybe five or ten pounds? I don't weigh myself obsessively, okay? I've been… stressed. And I haven't been eating as much. Honestly, this whole thing is just… draining. I just feel awful all the time, and it's impacting everything. Are you going to actually help me, or just keep asking questions? It's getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I want to help. Weight loss, fatigue, persistent diarrhea… Those can all be related. Just to be thorough, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven't left the state in… years. I live here. I work here. What are you even getting at? Is this going to take all day? I’m starting to regret even coming in. You're just making me more anxious with all these questions. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
