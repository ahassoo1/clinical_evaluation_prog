DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Roseburrough. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. I have a lot of it. More than usual, you see. It is… embarrassing, sometimes. I am hoping you can help me understand why.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a lot of gas,” more than usual. I understand it can be embarrassing, so don’t hesitate to be completely honest with me. Let's try to pinpoint what might be causing this. When did you first notice this increase in gas?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, about maybe three weeks ago, I would say. Around the middle of July, yes. July 15th, if I remember correctly. It was not sudden, just… gradually more and more. Before that, normal, you see. A little gas after a meal, perhaps, but nothing… problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around July 15th, gradually increasing. And before that, normal, occasional gas. Have you noticed anything specific that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have been thinking about that. I… well, I started eating more beans. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she makes a lovely bean soup, and she gave me some. I quite enjoy it. But I think… maybe that has something to do with it? I also had a very large cabbage at the market, and I made coleslaw. Perhaps that is also a factor? I do not know, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased bean intake and a larger serving of cabbage. Those are both known to cause gas in some people. Have you noticed any other changes in your diet around the same time?
PATIENT: Let me see… besides the beans and cabbage, no, not really. I have been drinking the same amount of water. I still have my usual breakfast, toast and a small amount of jam. Lunch is usually a sandwich. Dinner… varies, but nothing dramatically different. Oh! Wait. I did try a new brand of bread. It is whole wheat, very dark. I bought it at the new bakery, down on Elm Street. I suppose it is possible that could be it, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a new whole wheat bread from the bakery on Elm Street. We're building a good list here. Now, besides the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the gas. No… stomach pain, no bloating, no… anything else. It is just… a lot of it. Sometimes it smells… unpleasant, if I am being honest. But no pain. It is just… disruptive. And embarrassing, you see. It does not keep me from sleeping or anything, but it is… a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just increased gas, no pain, bloating, or other symptoms. And the smell is sometimes unpleasant. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to anything, not food or anything else. I can eat anything, usually. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though, this gas… perhaps she was wrong! But no, no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I do not take any pills, or anything like that. Just… regular food, and water. My Medicare covers my check-ups, and that is all I need, usually. A strong constitution, you see. Except for this gas, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else going on. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and just feel around. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I am happy to cooperate. I just want to understand why all this gas is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein. Just relax and breathe normally. …Sounds are normal. No unusual gurgling or anything concerning. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. It feels… normal. A little pressure, of course, but no pain. It feels just like my stomach usually does. Perhaps a little… empty, but not painful. You may continue, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, no tenderness in any area. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly detected. Sounds good. Given your symptoms – increased gas with no other complaints, and a normal physical exam – it’s most likely related to something you’re eating. The beans, cabbage, and new bread are all potential culprits. It’s a common issue. We can try an elimination diet, where you remove those potential triggers one by one to see if your symptoms improve. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If it is something I am eating, then removing the possible causes makes perfect sense. An elimination diet… I believe I can manage that. Perhaps I will start with the bread, since that is the newest addition. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any other foods I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Okay, starting with the bread is a good approach. Beyond that, generally, foods high in FODMAPs – that’s F-O-D-M-A-P-S – can contribute to gas. They are fermentable carbohydrates that can cause digestive upset. Things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, and some dairy products. But let’s not get overwhelmed right now. Start with the bread. Eliminate it for a week, and see if your symptoms improve. Keep a food diary – write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas. If the symptoms don’t improve, we’ll move on to eliminating other potential triggers. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I will eliminate the bread, and keep a detailed food diary. FODMAPs… I will need to write that down. F-O-D-M-A-P-S. I will pay attention to everything I eat, and when the… gas occurs. I am grateful for your help. It is a relief to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad we have a plan. And don’t hesitate to call if your symptoms worsen or if you have any questions. I'm also going to print you a handout about FODMAPs to help you identify foods to potentially avoid. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You have been very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my… problem. I will follow your instructions, and keep the food diary. Thank you again. I think… I think that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I’ll have the nurse print that handout for you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and let me know how the elimination diet goes.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. I will be in touch.
