DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bigger, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Delmon Bigger. Like the name say. I’m here ‘cause they tell me I gotta come. Been workin’ down in that mine a long time, you know. Long, long time. They say… something about the air? I don’t rightly remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, your employer flagged some concerns during a routine screening. Something about potential pneumoconiosis, or “miner’s lung.” Though frankly, at your age, a lot of things could be causing shortness of breath. Let's try to get a clearer picture, shall we?
PATIENT: Pneumo… what now? Look, I ain’t no fancy doctor. Just a man who work hard. “Miner’s lung” sound bad. I don’t feel bad. I walk here, didn’t I? And I climb stairs at home. Maybe a little slow, but still. What they want me to do, exactly?
DOCTOR: “Pneumoconiosis” simply means dust in your lungs, Mr. Bigger. It's…common in your profession. And while you can walk here, that doesn’t preclude a serious underlying condition. We need to rule things out. Now, I’ll need some details. Have you had a persistent cough?
PATIENT: Persistent… you mean, one that don’t go away? Not really. I cough sometimes, when the dust get in my throat. But that’s just dust! Everyone coughs when they breathe dust. Old man cough. Not a sick cough. I used to smoke a little too, back when I was younger. But I stopped that… oh, must be twenty year now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, the smoking history is…relevant. And your dismissal of the cough is noted. Alright. Have you noticed any wheezing or tightness in your chest?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Like… a whistling sound? No. Never noticed that. Tightness… sometimes my chest feel a little… heavy. But that's just from work, you know? Lifting things, bending over. Old man problems. Not like a sickness tightness. You askin’ about sicknesses? I ain't sick. I just need to get this over with so I can get back home. My wife… well, she passed on last year. I gotta check on the garden.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we still need to proceed with a basic examination to get a baseline. I'll listen to your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and perhaps order a chest X-ray. It’s standard procedure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not that I know of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, the little white pill. But that's all. Never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I get a little itchy sometimes from the mosquito bites, but that's not a medication! This sound like a lot of fuss for nothin’, if you ask me. But if you gotta do it, I guess you gotta do it. Just be quick, eh?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I’ll start with listening to your lungs. Breathe deeply through your mouth. There is some mild bilateral wheezing present. Not alarming, but warrants further investigation. Oxygen saturation is 93%. Again, not critical, but below optimal.
PATIENT: Wheezing again? See? I told you it's just dust! And 93… what’s wrong with 93? My grandson, he plays soccer, he gets winded all the time! This is just old man stuff, doctor. You makin’ a mountain outta a molehill, I tell ya. What’s next? The X-ray, right? Let's just get it done. I don’t want to be stuck here all day.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration, but dismissing potential concerns based on your grandson’s athletic activity is…unhelpful. While your grandson may experience temporary shortness of breath, we are evaluating your respiratory health in the context of decades of occupational dust exposure. The chest X-ray is necessary. I’m ordering a standard posteroanterior and lateral view. The radiology department is down the hall. They’ll call you when they’re ready. The results will be sent to me, and we can discuss them at a follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Follow-up appointment? Now you're talkin' about comin' back again? Look, I came here to get cleared, not to make a new home. Is this X-ray gonna tell you anything I ain't already told you? I feel fine! Just a little tired, like any old man after a hard day. Is it gonna take long? My garden… I gotta water the tomatoes. They need me. .
DOCTOR: The X-ray will provide a visual assessment of your lungs. It's a necessary step, Mr. Bigger. It won’t take long. Perhaps 15-20 minutes. And frankly, if you’re so concerned about your tomatoes, you should prioritize your health. Here's a requisition form. Go to radiology. They're expecting you. And I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment before you leave, just to be thorough. .
