DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Shely. It’s… nice to meet you too. Um, well, it’s about my speech, I suppose. It's been a bit… off, lately. Hard to explain, really. It feels slurred sometimes, and I’m not sure why.
DOCTOR: I understand. “A bit off” and slurred speech can certainly be concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a tricky one. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t the best. Vaguely… a few weeks, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint. It didn't happen all at once, more of a gradual thing. I don’t recall anything specific that caused it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Swaby. Gradual onset can often be harder to track. A few weeks is helpful, though. And it’s perfectly alright if you aren’t certain on exact dates. Could you describe what you mean by “slurred”?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s like… when I talk, the words don’t come out as clearly as they usually do. Like I’m mumbling, maybe? Or like… trying to say something with a mouthful of food, even when I haven’t eaten anything. My husband, he’s noticed it more than I have, actually. He says I sometimes repeat syllables. I don’t always feel like I’m having trouble, but he points it out.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Ms. Swaby. Repeating syllables and difficulty with clarity are important details. And it’s good your husband has noticed – sometimes an outside perspective is very helpful. Has this been constant over the past few weeks, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days I hardly notice it at all, and I feel perfectly normal. Other days… it’s more pronounced. It seems to be worse when I’m tired, I think. Or when I’ve been talking for a long time. It’s not every single moment, thankfully. It's just… unpredictable, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, unpredictable is a good way to put it. It’s helpful to know it's related to fatigue and length of speech. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the speech changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not that I can recall, really. No headaches, no dizziness. No trouble with my vision, and my arms and legs feel fine. I haven’t felt any weakness or numbness. Honestly, it's mostly just the speech. Everything else seems normal, as far as I know. I suppose I've been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No associated weakness, numbness, or vision changes is reassuring. And attributing the fatigue to work is reasonable. Now, I'm going to ask some more general questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses or surgeries… Let’s see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a long time ago. And… honestly, Doctor, I can’t recall anything else major. Just the usual childhood things – chickenpox, that sort of thing. I've been pretty healthy overall, thankfully. No ongoing conditions that I’m aware of. I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Tonsillectomy as a child, and otherwise healthy, is helpful information. And thank you for mentioning your insurance. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything, as far as I remember. No food allergies, no reactions to penicillin or any other medications. I don't take any regular medication at the moment. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. My husband might know more, he keeps track of those things. But I'm pretty sure I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies or regular medications. That simplifies things. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a bit tricky, Doctor. My parents… they both passed away a few years ago. And I didn't have a lot of close relatives. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some heart trouble, but I don’t know the specifics. It wasn’t a very close family, unfortunately, so I don’t really know much about their medical history. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. It’s not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Swaby. That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for family medical history to be limited. High blood pressure and heart trouble in your parents is still useful information, thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I'm a construction manager, so I'm on my feet a lot. It's a pretty physical job, you know? I work long hours, usually five or six days a week. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat healthy, but it can be hard with the job, sometimes. Mostly I'm just… busy. And tired, as I mentioned before. I am married, and my husband is very supportive. That's about it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Swaby. That gives me a good understanding of your background. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam to assess your speech and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezes or crackles detected. Now, I'd like to check your cranial nerves. This will involve me asking you to follow my finger with your eyes, and testing your facial muscles. Your eye movements are normal, and your facial muscles appear symmetrical. Next, I’ll test your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Finally, I'm going to ask you to say a few sentences and repeat some words to assess your speech articulation. I notice some mild slurring in your articulation, particularly with longer sentences. The slurring is intermittent, as you described. It is not consistent. There is also some slight difficulty with rapid speech. Overall, the exam is largely normal, but the intermittent slurring is concerning and warrants further investigation. Do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… alright, I suppose. Though it is a bit worrying to hear about the slurring. I knew something wasn't quite right, but I wasn’t sure how to explain it. So, what does this mean, Doctor? What kind of investigation are you thinking about? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Swaby. It's natural to be worried when you hear something isn't quite right. The intermittent slurring, while not immediately alarming, does need to be investigated. Several things could be causing this. It could be related to fatigue, as you’ve mentioned, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Some potential causes include: Early signs of a neurological issue: While I don’t want to jump to conclusions, it’s important to consider conditions that affect the nerves controlling speech. Transient Ischemic Attack : A temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain, sometimes called a “mini-stroke.” Medication side effects: Although you aren't taking any current medications, we should consider this. Inner ear problems: Issues with balance and hearing can sometimes affect speech. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I'd also like to order a speech evaluation with a speech-language pathologist. They can assess your speech in detail and provide a more comprehensive analysis. I also recommend a complete blood count to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds a bit scary, Doctor. But if it’s necessary to find out what’s going on, then I suppose so. A speech evaluation and blood work sound fine too. I trust your judgment. What’s involved with the MRI? Will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Swaby. An MRI can sound daunting, but it's a very safe and painless procedure. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. You won't feel anything at all. It can be a bit noisy, so we’ll provide you with earplugs or headphones. The scan usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. I'll send the order to the radiology department, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. The speech evaluation will involve a meeting with a speech-language pathologist who will assess your speech and language skills. It typically takes about an hour. I'll also send an order for the blood work, which can be done at our clinic lab. The results of the MRI usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The blood work results should be available within a few days. Once I have those results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness, numbness, vision changes, severe headache, or difficulty understanding speech, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the procedure or the follow-up plan?
PATIENT: No, I think that explains everything quite well, Doctor. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. It’s a bit overwhelming, but I feel better knowing we're doing something to figure out what’s going on. I will be sure to contact you immediately if anything changes or gets worse. Thank you again, Dr. Shely. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Swaby. It's my pleasure. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. I’ll have my nurse schedule your appointments for the MRI and speech evaluation before you leave. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns, even if it's just to talk. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. We'll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Shely. I really appreciate it. I feel a bit better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Swaby. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please let my nurse know if you have any trouble scheduling your appointments. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if needed.
