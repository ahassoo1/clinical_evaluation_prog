DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Don't bother with the niceties, really. I haven't got all day. It's my stool, alright? It's…black. Like tar, practically. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. That's all you need to know. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta. I understand you’re concerned about your stool being black and tarry, and that you take pain medication for arthritis. It’s good you mentioned the pain pills. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. A few days, maybe? It’s not like I sit and examine everything, you know. I just noticed it and thought, well, this isn't right. Why does it matter when? It's black now. Is it something serious? Because I have things to do, and I don't have time for…complications.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. It’s helpful to know when it started because it can give us clues about the cause. But a few days ago is a good starting point. Black, tarry stools can be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is why it’s important to investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Good heavens. Well, I have been a bit tired lately, but who isn’t at my age? And my stomach…it’s not exactly happy all the time. Those pills aren't exactly gentle, you know. But no, I haven’t been sick or anything. Just…old, mostly. And irritated. Is it the pills, then? I knew I shouldn't have listened to Mildred about taking them every day! Though, she swears they're the only reason she can still garden. Honestly, people…
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some stomach upset along with the black stools and you're taking pain pills regularly for arthritis. It could be related to the medication, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I see here you’re currently on… let me see… naproxen 500mg twice daily. Do you take anything else regularly, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Naproxen, yes. And sometimes I take something for heartburn, you know, when the naproxen gets to me. Tums, I think. The pink ones. Nothing fancy. And…oh! Sometimes a little bit of iron, because the doctor said my levels were low last year. But I forget to take it half the time. It's a little pill, and I just…forget. Is that important? Honestly, you're asking a lot of questions for a simple black stool.
DOCTOR: Okay, so naproxen twice daily, occasional Tums for heartburn, and sometimes iron supplements. That's helpful to know. It is important, Dawnetta, because iron supplements can also cause black stools, but so can bleeding. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any major medical problems in the past, like heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you're going way back. Let's see… My husband had heart trouble, but I didn't. And no, no diabetes, thank the Lord. My mother had it, dreadful thing. And…kidneys? I don’t think so. I had a bladder infection once, a long time ago, but that’s it. I go to the dentist regularly, if that counts. This is all so tedious, really. Are you sure it’s not just the pills? Because if it is, I'd like to know right now. I have a bridge game at two.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I appreciate your patience. I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Okay, no history of heart disease or diabetes. Have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Surgery… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. Must have been thirty years ago, at least. And…oh, I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, falling on the ice. That’s it, I think. A long time ago. They didn’t do much, just put a cast on it. Honestly, I’m a perfectly healthy woman for my age, except for the arthritis. It’s just this stool thing! Is it going to take all day to figure this out? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your family. Has anyone in your family had a history of stomach ulcers, bleeding problems, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, now you're asking about everyone? Family history... My father smoked, and he had a cough. That's about it. My mother’s side…well, they all lived to be old, mostly. No ulcers that I know of, no bleeding problems, and certainly no colon cancer. We didn't talk about such things. It was considered…indelicate. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I really must go. My game...
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of stomach ulcers, bleeding problems, or colon cancer. Alright, Dawnetta. I understand your frustration and the fact that you have a bridge game to get to. Based on what you’ve told me, it could be related to the naproxen or the iron supplements, but given the black, tarry stool, it’s important to rule out any internal bleeding. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, listen to your abdomen, and check your vital signs. I may also need to order a simple blood test to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod me? After all these questions? Honestly. Fine, alright. Get it over with. But make it quick. I have a reputation to uphold at bridge, you know. And if I miss a hand because of this, I'm sending you the bill. Though, I doubt you understand the seriousness of a good game. Just…hurry. And don't tell me anything terrible, alright? I don’t want to ruin my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ll be as quick as possible. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table. Your abdomen sounds… normal. Not distended, no obvious masses. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little bit, yes. Right…there. On the left side. It’s always been a bit sensitive, really. But I blame that on Mildred and her constant advice about posture. Honestly, she thinks she’s a doctor. Don't press so hard, alright? It's my arthritis, you know. Everything hurts. Just get it over with. I’m starting to get anxious. What does it mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, just a bit of tenderness on the left side. I'll be very gentle. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 76. That’s within a normal range. Given the tenderness, the black stool, and your history of taking naproxen, I'm concerned about a possible ulcer or gastritis. While it could be something minor, it’s important to investigate further. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for blood. I'm also going to order an upper endoscopy. This is a procedure where we use a small camera to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. I understand this sounds a bit daunting, but it's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis and rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain the endoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? A camera down my throat? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I knew it. I knew it wouldn’t be anything simple. Mildred will be insufferable. Honestly, I just wanted someone to tell me to stop taking the pills! That's all. An endoscopy... it sounds dreadful. I don’t want to hear any more about it. Is there… is there anything else we can do? I really, really don’t want a camera down my throat. Are you sure it’s necessary? And what if it finds something terrible? This is just awful. I’m going home. I've wasted enough time already.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Dawnetta. It’s perfectly normal to be worried. The endoscopy is the most accurate way to determine the cause of the black stool and any tenderness you're experiencing. While it’s not the most pleasant procedure, it's very safe, and we can provide sedation to make you comfortable. However, if you absolutely refuse the endoscopy at this time, we can start with a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, a medication that reduces stomach acid, and stop the naproxen immediately. We can also closely monitor your symptoms. But please understand that without further investigation, we can't rule out a more serious condition, like a bleeding ulcer. Would you be willing to try the medication and close monitoring?
PATIENT: A medication… and stop the pills? Alright. Fine. But only if I don’t have to have that… that camera thing. And you have to promise me you’ll explain everything very clearly. And no more prodding! I’m not a science experiment. And if I start feeling worse, I want to be able to come in here right away. No waiting around. And I'm blaming you if it's anything serious. Honestly, I should have just stayed home and played bridge. This is all very upsetting. Now, what does this medication do, and how long will it take? And do I need a special diet? I really don’t want to change my diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. We can definitely start with a medication called omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, to reduce your stomach acid. We’ll stop the naproxen immediately. Omeprazole works by blocking the production of acid in your stomach, which can help heal any inflammation and prevent further bleeding. You’ll take one 20mg tablet once daily, preferably in the morning, 30 minutes before a meal. As for a special diet, you don't need one, but I recommend avoiding spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomatoes, as they can irritate your stomach. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or feeling dizzy or lightheaded – please come to the emergency room immediately. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to assess your response to the medication. If your symptoms haven’t improved by then, or if they worsen, we’ll need to reconsider the endoscopy. Here’s a summary of the instructions, as well as the number for the clinic and the emergency room. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks, alright. And no endoscopy if I'm feeling better. You promised. And I don't want to be on this medication forever, alright? I have enough pills as it is. No spicy food… no caffeine… honestly, what am I supposed to eat? This is ridiculous. Alright. Fine. I think that's all. I need to get home now. I’m sure Mildred is already planning her next lecture. Thank you… I suppose. But I'm blaming you if this doesn't work. And tell your nurses to be gentle. I have a very low tolerance for prodding. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dawnetta. We’ll do our best to make you comfortable, and I’m hopeful the medication will help. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. And please, do come back immediately if you experience any worsening symptoms. Mildred, it seems, is a force to be reckoned with. .
