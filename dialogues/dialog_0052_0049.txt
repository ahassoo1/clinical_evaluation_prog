DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor... Shely, was it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s me ears, see. They ain't what they used to be. Things are just… muffled, like talkin’ underwater, almost. Not painful, just… hard to hear. It's been gettin' worse, I reckon. Not sure how long, though. Time just slips away, don't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does, Mr. Schneer. Thank you for explaining that. "Muffled hearing that's been gradually worsening" – that’s helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if this is happening in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Hmm... I think... both, yeah. Both ears. But maybe one's a little worse than the other? It's hard to say, honestly. Everything just sounds... distant, no matter which ear I'm listenin' with. I used to be able to hear a pin drop, ya know? Now… not so much. Used to work in a noisy factory, maybe that had somethin' to do with it. Shoe factory, it was. Lots of clatter.
DOCTOR: I see. "Bilateral muffled hearing, gradual onset, with a history of noise exposure at a shoe factory." That is important information, Mr. Schneer. When did you retire from the shoe factory, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, land, that was... a long time ago now. Let me think... Must've been… the early nineties, I reckon. Ninety-two, maybe ninety-three? It's all a bit of a blur, ya know? It was a good job, though. Steady work. But noisy, awful noisy. They didn’t have much in the way of ear protection back then, either. Just kinda… got used to it, I suppose. Not the smartest thing, lookin’ back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That helps me build a clearer picture. Beyond the hearing loss, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see… Well, sometimes I get a bit of a ringin' in me ears, especially when it’s quiet. Just a faint ringin', though. Not constant. And sometimes… feel a little unsteady on me feet, but I figured that’s just gettin’ old! Everything creaks a bit more these days, ya know? It's hard to say what's related to the ears and what's just… me.
DOCTOR: "Intermittent tinnitus, and occasional unsteadiness." Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schneer. The unsteadiness is something we'll need to explore further. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… The doctor told me somethin' once about me blood pressure bein' a little high, years ago. I think I was on somethin' for it for a while, but I can’t rightly recall if I still am. And… I think I had a bit of trouble with me heart a long time back, but it was a long time ago and they fixed it, I think. I see a doctor regularly, but I forget what they tell me half the time! Medicare pays for it, ya know, so I go. Old age, it’s a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to forget details, Mr. Schneer, especially with everything going on. We have access to your electronic health records here, so I can review your history of hypertension and any cardiac issues. Do you recall the names of any medications you are currently taking, even if it’s just a general idea?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a tough one. I take a little white pill every mornin’, I think. And a bigger blue one at night, maybe. But what they are for… I honestly couldn't tell ya. They come in bottles, ya know? I just take 'em like I'm supposed to. I have a daughter, bless her heart, she helps me keep track of things sometimes. But she doesn’t always know either, I reckon. It's just a jumble in me head these days. I really don’t keep up with all that stuff. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common, and not something to worry about. Let's focus on getting a clearer picture. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination, including an examination of your ears, to assess the hearing loss and rule out any obvious causes. Would that be alright with you?
