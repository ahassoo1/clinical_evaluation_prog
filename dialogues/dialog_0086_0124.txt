DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it's hard to explain. I’ve just been feeling really tired lately, and my skin seems to be getting darker. Not like a sunburn, but… just darker all over, I think. It’s a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Darkening of the skin, you say. And fatigue. Okay. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The tiredness has been building for maybe… two, three months, I’d say. But the skin thing… that’s newer. Maybe a month? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It just seemed to… happen gradually.
DOCTOR: Two to three months of fatigue, a month of skin darkening. And is this darkening all over, or are there specific areas that you’ve noticed it more prominently?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty even, I think. Maybe a little more on my hands and feet? And my face, probably. It’s not like patches or anything, just… everything looks a bit… dingier, if that makes sense. I’m not getting much sun these days either, so it's not like a tan.
DOCTOR: No noticeable patches, just a general darkening, despite limited sun exposure. Alright. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. I’ve been… a little more thirsty than usual, maybe? And I feel like I'm going to the bathroom a lot more often. Not painful or anything, just… more trips. I thought it was just getting older, honestly.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and frequency of urination… Okay. And have you experienced any weight loss, changes in appetite, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss. Actually, I think I might have gained a little, to be honest. My appetite is normal, and no pain, no. Everything feels… normal there, just tired and… darker. It’s just all a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some medicine and it's been okay ever since. I take that every day. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy, I think. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication… good. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. That’s it. I take one tablet every morning. And I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now? Something like that. It seems to keep things under control, the doctor checks it regularly.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily for five years. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything as long as I can remember and never had a reaction. And I haven’t changed any soaps or anything like that recently. I’m pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2 I think, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems, but I don’t know much about it, to be honest. He passed away a long time ago. My brother is healthy as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in mother, heart problems in father. And finally, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had a drink in… oh, a long time. And definitely no drugs. I work at the chemical plant, I need to be clear-headed!
DOCTOR: Chemical plant work, no smoking, limited alcohol, no drugs. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Skin is noticeably darker than expected, particularly on the palmar surfaces and soles. No lesions or rashes noted. Capillary refill is slightly delayed at 3 seconds. Okay. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel and a hemoglobin A1c. Also, a thyroid stimulating hormone test. It's best to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Blood work, you said? What exactly will those tests tell us? And is the delayed capillary refill something to worry about? I’m starting to get a little anxious, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a better understanding of your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. The A1c will tell us your average blood sugar over the past few months, and the thyroid test will check if your thyroid is working properly. The slightly delayed capillary refill… it's not necessarily alarming, but it could suggest some minor circulatory issues. We’ll need the blood work to get a clearer picture. It's likely nothing serious, but we have to be thorough. It's probably just dehydration, to be honest. We'll start there. We'll get the lab results back in a few days, and then we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… so it could be a lot of things. Kidney problems, sugar levels… Oh dear. And dehydration? I do feel thirsty a lot, you’re right. Will I need a fasting test? I hate those. And where do I go for the blood work? Is it here at the clinic? It’s just… a lot to take in, Doctor. I'm a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, the A1c test does require fasting for eight hours beforehand. I’ll give you a slip for the lab; it’s located across the parking lot. You'll need to schedule an appointment. And honestly, Ms. Paes, you’re perfectly healthy, probably just a minor issue. Don’t worry yourself sick over this. We’re just covering all the bases. Here’s the lab order and some instructions for the fasting test. Come back in a week to discuss the results. Is there anything else?
