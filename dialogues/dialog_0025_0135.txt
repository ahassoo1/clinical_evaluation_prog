DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is my ear. It… has liquid coming from it. For maybe three days now. It is not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Liquid… alright. And is it painful, or just… irritating?
PATIENT: It is not… a strong pain. More… a fullness. And sometimes, a small… ache. But not a pain that makes me yell, you understand? Just… bothersome. And the liquid… it smells a little. Not good smell.
DOCTOR: A fullness and a small ache, and it smells… not good. Okay. Have you noticed any hearing loss with this ear, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Yes. The hearing… it is not as sharp. Like… cloth over the ear. And… one time, I stood up quickly and felt… the room move. Just for a moment. It was yesterday. But it did happen. I was careful after that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not… put things in my ear. My wife… she always said it is dangerous. She is… not here now. But I remember her words. I waited to come to a doctor. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: That is correct. It's good you didn’t try to self-treat. We need to take a look. I'm going to examine your ear. It'll only take a moment. I'll need you to sit forward a little. Alright, let’s take a look… Hmm. There’s quite a bit of discharge, and the canal is inflamed. The tympanic membrane looks… obscured. It’s difficult to get a good view. I see some redness, but no visible perforation at this time. Your temperature is 98.7, pulse is 72, and blood pressure is 130 over 80. Nothing concerning there.
PATIENT: Inflamed? Obscured? I do not… understand these words, Doctor. Is it… serious? Is my ear broken? My wife… she had an ear infection once, but it did not sound like this. She took… pills. Will I need pills?
DOCTOR: "Inflamed" means it's red and swollen. "Obscured" simply means I can't see the eardrum clearly because of the discharge. No, your ear isn’t broken. It sounds like you have an infection of the outer ear canal – otitis externa, we call it. It’s not uncommon, especially with summer weather. Your wife's infection may have been a middle ear infection, which is different. We’ll need to send a sample of the discharge to the lab to see what kind of bacteria is causing it. This will help me choose the best medication. I'm going to prescribe you some ear drops with an antibiotic and some pain drops. You’ll need to clean the outside of your ear canal gently with a cotton swab before each application. I will also give you a prescription for oral pain medication to help with discomfort.
PATIENT: Antibiotic? Oral? Cotton swab… I remember my wife… she used those. But… the lab? Will they… take blood? I do not like needles, Doctor. And how long… how long will I be sick? I teach students… I cannot miss many days. They need to learn. Is it… contagious?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Radillo, we won’t be taking blood. The lab just needs a small sample of the fluid from your ear. It's a quick swab, nothing like a needle. As for how long you'll be sick, it depends on how quickly the infection responds to the medication. Usually, it’s a week or so with the ear drops. The oral pain medication is just to manage the discomfort while the drops start to work. And no, it’s not contagious. You won’t be spreading this to your students. I'm printing out detailed instructions for cleaning your ear and applying the drops. It’s very important you follow those carefully. I'm also writing a note for your school explaining you are under my care for an ear infection. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes… cleaning… two times a day… drops… three times… It is… many things to remember. And… what if the drops do not work? What if it gets worse? My wife… she always knew what to do. I… I am not good with these things. Could you… write down the most important parts? Just… the cleaning and the drops. Only those. Please?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. Here. This is just the essentials. Clean the outside of your ear canal gently with a cotton swab two times a day. Then, put three drops in your ear three times a day. It’s really that simple. If it doesn't improve after three days, or if you develop a fever, then you need to come back immediately. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Three days… and fever… Yes. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very patient with me. My wife… she would be pleased. Is there… anything else I need to know? Before I forget? Perhaps about… swimming? I like to swim sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. Avoid swimming until the infection has completely cleared. Water can worsen it. And try to keep your ear dry in the shower. You can use earplugs if you need to. I've noted all of this in your chart. I want to see you back in one week for a follow-up to ensure the infection is resolving. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you again. You have helped me very much. I will… remember the drops. And the swimming. And I will see you in one week. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Get well soon, Mr. Radillo.
