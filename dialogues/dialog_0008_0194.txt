DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's…well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, she insisted I come. Something about a family thing, too. I don’t quite remember everything, to be honest. It feels like it comes and goes, this…problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. No worries at all, it's common for things to be a little hazy. Let’s focus on your ears first. When you say “acting up,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, sometimes it’s like everything gets muffled, you know? Like someone turned the volume down really low. And then…oh dear…sometimes the room just spins. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s…unsettling. Like being on a boat, I suppose, but I haven’t been on a boat in years. It doesn't last long, usually. But it’s enough to make me a bit wobbly.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and dizziness… that’s helpful. And you said this doesn’t happen constantly?
PATIENT: No, no. Not constantly. It comes in waves, I think. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and then other days…well, like today, it’s a bit off. It’s hard to say when it will happen. And it’s not always the same, either. Sometimes just the muffling, sometimes the spinning, sometimes both. It’s…frustrating, to be honest. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Terasa. Okay, let's try to get a better picture of this. When did you first notice these episodes of muffling and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…that’s a hard one. My memory isn't what it used to be. I want to say…maybe a few months ago? It started gradually, I think. At first, I thought it was just me getting older. But then it started happening more often, and my daughter, Lani, she got worried. She's the one who really pushed me to come in. I honestly can’t pinpoint a specific date, I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Terasa. It’s perfectly alright. “A few months ago” is a good starting point. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm…not that I’ve noticed, no. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything in particular. I haven’t been sick or anything. I haven’t bumped my head. I’ve just…woken up with it sometimes, or been going about my day and suddenly felt a bit off. I work at the club, you see, dealing cards…it hasn't happened at work, not that I recall, but it’s busy there. Lots of noise. Maybe that has something to do with it? I really don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, working at the club, dealing cards…lots of noise. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Let’s talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. Well, I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure sometimes, the doctor told me. I take a little pill for it, I think. And my knees…they ache something awful, especially when it’s cold. But other than that…not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor much, to be honest. I don't like going. It's usually nothing serious. My daughter worries too much. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Terasa. High blood pressure and achy knees. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear…no, I don’t. I just take the little white pill every morning. I have Lani fill my prescriptions, she handles all that for me. I really don't pay attention to the names, I just know I need to take it. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's just…a lot to keep track of when you get to my age, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Terasa. We can look that up in your records. And we will. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young, a long, long time ago. That’s the only surgery I can think of. And…oh, I was in the hospital once, years ago, when I broke my wrist. Fell down the stairs, silly thing. But that was decades ago. Nothing since then, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy, considering. Until these ears started acting up, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a broken wrist. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any family members who have experienced similar problems with their ears, dizziness, or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, that's what Lani was worried about, I think. My mother…she had trouble with her balance when she got older. She fell a lot, and the doctor said it was something to do with her inner ear. And my brother, he had ringing in his ears for years. Constant ringing, he said. It drove him mad. I don’t know if that’s the same thing, though. It all feels a bit…confusing, to be honest. Family history…it’s hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother with balance issues and your brother with tinnitus. That's good information to have, Terasa. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. Lani always asks me that, too, whenever I go to the doctor, but I always tell her, “No, dear, I eat anything.” I think I’m pretty lucky, actually. No allergies, no serious illnesses…until these ears, of course. It’s just been the ears lately. Is that all the questions you have? I’d like to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I understand you'd like to finish up, Terasa. Just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, and no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. Doctor told me it wasn't good for my blood pressure. And…well, I’m a church lady, dear. I don't go near any of that other stuff. Do you need anything else? I really am starting to feel a bit tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Good to know. Alright, Terasa, I think I have enough information for now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, balance, and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, please. The sooner I get out of here, the better. I have a bird feeder to fill, you see. The little ones are waiting. Let’s just get it done. I'm not afraid, mind you, just…tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to take a look in your ears first. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it hurts. Okay, Terasa, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then check your blood pressure. Alright. Your ears are a little red inside, and I’m seeing some wax buildup in both of them. Your balance seems a little off, and your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. I'm going to document these findings. Okay, Terasa, based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a combination of things. The wax buildup could be contributing to the muffled hearing, and the balance issues could be related to your inner ear, potentially similar to what your mother experienced. The elevated blood pressure could also be playing a role. Now, I want to be clear, this isn’t a definitive diagnosis. We'll need to do some further testing.
PATIENT: Testing? Oh, dear. What kind of testing? I really don't want to have to come back here again. Is it going to be painful? Because I don't do well with pain, you see. And how long will it take? I have commitments, you know. Bird feeders don't fill themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. The testing is quite simple and generally not painful at all. We'll start with an audiometry test, which is a hearing test. It involves wearing headphones and listening for sounds – just telling me when you can and can’t hear them. Then, we might do a balance test, which involves some simple movements and looking at a specific point. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or two in total. We can schedule it for a day that works best for you, and I’ll make sure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend we try to gently remove some of the wax buildup in your ears. We can do that here in the clinic, and it should help improve your hearing right away. Does that sound okay?
