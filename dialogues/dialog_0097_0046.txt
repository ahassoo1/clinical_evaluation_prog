DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, welcome! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you as well, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little while now,” could you give me a sense of how long that is?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I believe, in late June. So, roughly five or six weeks now. It’s not constant, but it’s frequent enough that it’s become… noticeable. And a little concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six weeks. Not constant, but frequent and concerning – that's helpful. Can you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… a fullness, even when I haven’t just had anything to drink. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. And sometimes, it feels like I need to go right now, even if there isn’t much urine actually there. It's a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness even without recent intake, uncomfortable rather than painful, and that urgency even with little urine… That does sound frustrating. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think it’s a little worse in the evenings, generally. And if I’ve been sitting for a long period, like at my desk working, it seems to get more noticeable then too. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but those seem to be the times when I feel it the most.
DOCTOR: Alright, evenings and after prolonged sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. The color seems normal, and the amount… well, it’s been fairly typical, I suppose. No blood, no unusual odor. Just… the pressure is the issue, not what comes out, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. No changes to the urine itself, just the sensation. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and my back has been fine. It really is just this bladder pressure. I haven’t felt unwell otherwise, which is why I waited a little while before coming in, to be honest. I was hoping it would resolve on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you haven't been feeling generally unwell. Waiting to see if it resolves on its own is understandable. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about three years ago, and I take medication for that – lisinopril, 10mg daily. Other than that, nothing major. No surgeries, no other chronic illnesses. And I’m up to date on all my vaccinations, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with lisinopril. That’s good to know. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food. I did have a bit of a sensitivity to certain detergents when I was younger, but that’s long resolved. Nothing that would be relevant here, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother has type 2 diabetes, and my father had heart disease. My maternal grandmother also had arthritis. On my side, there’s no history of bladder issues or kidney problems that I am aware of. I don’t believe there is, anyway. Would you like me to be more specific?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis in the family. Knowing there's no known history of bladder issues is good. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible. I eat a balanced diet and try to exercise a few times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a quick neurological check and a pelvic exam to rule out any obvious issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please proceed when you’re ready. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. I’m going to use a stethoscope to listen for any unusual sounds. It might be a little cold, so let me know if you’re uncomfortable. Bowel sounds are normal. No tenderness to palpation. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological check. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly. I can see it clearly. It’s not a problem at all.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Good strength. Now, let’s move on to the pelvic exam. I want to explain what I’ll be doing first. I’ll be using a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. Then I'll do a bimanual exam, where I’ll insert two fingers into the vagina while placing my other hand on your lower abdomen to feel your uterus and ovaries. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you feel any pain at any point. I'll be using lubricant to make it more comfortable. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I understand it may be a little uncomfortable, and I will absolutely let you know if I feel any pain. Please proceed when you're ready. I trust your care, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s get started. I’m going to insert the speculum now. Just relax your muscles as much as possible. The cervix looks normal. No signs of inflammation or lesions. Now I’m going to do the bimanual exam. Uterus is normal size and position. Ovaries are normal. No masses or tenderness. Okay, everything feels normal on the pelvic exam as well. No obvious abnormalities detected. I’ll just listen to your lungs quickly to complete the exam. Lungs are clear. Okay. I will be right back. Please get dressed and I will come back to discuss what I think is going on.
