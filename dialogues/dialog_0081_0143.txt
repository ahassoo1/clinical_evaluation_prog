DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My… someone I care about, she's thinking about having a baby. And I thought… it’s best to be sure everything is alright, you know? Before… before it happens. I’m not very good with remembering things, so I hope I can explain okay. It’s about… getting ready for a baby, I think?
DOCTOR: Getting ready for a baby. Right. While I appreciate your… proactive approach, Mr. Verrall, I'm a physician. I treat patients. Are you experiencing a medical issue, or are you inquiring about pre-conception counseling for someone else?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, sorry. It’s for… for her. Not me. I just… I want to make sure everything is okay for both of us. She hasn’t seen a doctor yet, and I thought I should come first, to ask what she needs to do. Is that… alright? I get confused easily, so if I’m not making sense, please tell me. It’s about… preparing for a baby, for her. I hope that’s clearer.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re seeking information regarding pre-conception health for your… companion. While it’s commendable you’re taking an interest, it would be far more effective if she were here to discuss her medical history directly. However, I suppose I can offer some general guidance. Let’s start with this: does she have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. She… I think she’s healthy. She doesn’t talk much about being sick. Sometimes she gets… tired, very tired, but she works very hard. She doesn’t go to the doctor often, I don’t think. I’m not sure if she has anything… specific. Is there a list of things I should ask her? It’s hard to remember what’s important. She doesn’t like talking about… well, personal things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no known medical history. Excellent. Well, that narrows it down… slightly. Look, Mr. Verrall, it’s rather difficult to assess someone’s health without, you know, knowing their health. But, very generally, before attempting pregnancy, a woman should ideally have a check-up to screen for things like… rubella immunity, STIs, chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension, and a basic blood panel. She also needs to be aware of any family history of genetic disorders. Do you know anything about her family medical history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s… difficult. She doesn’t talk about her family much either. I know… she said her mother had… trouble with her heart, when she was older. But I don’t know what kind of trouble. And… I think her brother had something with his… lungs? But it was a long time ago. I really don’t know much. I wish I could be more helpful. Is there a way to find out? Like, a test that can check for everything?
DOCTOR: A test that can check for everything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not everything. Just… a good start? I feel bad not knowing. She trusts me, but… I’m not a doctor, and I don’t want to ask her too many questions and bother her. She’s… private. Is there a list of questions I could write down? Or maybe a pamphlet I could give her? Something she could read herself? I just want to make sure she's healthy, and the baby will be healthy too.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Verrall, I can print a generic pre-conception checklist. But frankly, this is a rather… inefficient way to approach healthcare. It would be far more productive if she scheduled an appointment herself. However… Here. This outlines some basic recommendations and potential questions to discuss with a physician. It’s rather… basic. And it doesn’t replace a thorough medical evaluation. She really should see a doctor. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Thank you. This is very helpful. I’ll… I'll give this to her, and encourage her to make an appointment. Maybe if I… if I go with her, it will be easier? She gets nervous at doctors. I appreciate you being patient with me. I’m not very good at remembering things, so I might need to ask her to explain some of it to me later. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Look, Mr. Verrall, if you accompany her, that's… acceptable. But ultimately, she needs to be the one providing her medical history. It's rather difficult to assess someone's health through a third party. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. I just… wanted to make sure we were doing everything right. Thank you for your time. I’ll encourage her to call and make an appointment soon. I… I don’t want to bother you anymore. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. See that she does. Good day to you as well, Mr. Verrall. .
PATIENT: .
