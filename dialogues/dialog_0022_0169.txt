DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Tosca, you said? Hmm. It’s… my face, mostly. And my legs. They’re puffed up, see? Like balloons. Not comfortable at all. I don't rightly know why they’re doing that, though. It just… happened, I guess. Been a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Your face and legs are swollen, and this has been going on for a few days. That’s good information to start with. Let me just quickly look over your record here. I see you’re 59 years old, Swedish descent. And it notes you don’t currently have insurance, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep. That’s all right. Insurance… never really needed it much before. And truthfully, can’t afford it these days. Not on what I make. Welding ain't what it used to be, you know? So, you’re looking at my… chart? What’s in there, anyway? Just curious.
DOCTOR: It just has some basic information – your age, race, height and weight, that sort of thing. It helps me get a general picture. Don’t worry, I’m not digging for anything specific at this point. Now, about your face and legs… can you describe the swelling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… all over, really. Not just one spot. My cheeks feel… tight. And my eyes, kinda puffy around ‘em. And the legs… feel like they’re gonna burst, almost. Especially at the ankles. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Heavy, you know? Like I’m walking through water. Happened pretty sudden-like, too. Woke up one morning and there it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's all over – cheeks, around the eyes, and ankles – and it feels heavy and uncomfortable, not particularly painful. It came on suddenly a few days ago. Alright, Mr. Miner, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also take a look at your legs and ankles to assess the swelling. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’ve had doctors poke and prod before. Not much to it, I suppose. Just hope you can figure out what's going on. It’s a bother, this swelling is. Makes it hard to get around.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m noticing significant swelling in both of your legs, especially around the ankles, as you mentioned. And when I press on the skin, it leaves a noticeable indent for a little while – that's what we call pitting edema. Do you notice any changes in your urine – like the color, how often you go, or any burning sensation?
PATIENT: Urine? Hmm… I don’t rightly pay much attention to that sort of thing. It looks… normal, I guess. Yellowish, like it always is. And I go… you know… when I need to. No burning. No different than usual, as far as I can tell. Never been one to scrutinize my… output. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Miner, but I understand you don’t typically pay close attention to it. It helps us rule out certain possibilities. Okay. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded when I’m working, bending and lifting, but that's just from the work, I figure. Always been that way. Chest pain… no. No pain in the chest. Unless you count the worry, of course. This swelling’s got me a bit worried, to be honest. It ain’t normal.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. It’s good that you haven’t had any chest pain or shortness of breath. Alright, Mr. Miner, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. Swelling in the legs and face like this could be related to a number of things – kidney issues, heart problems, or even a build-up of fluid due to protein loss. Given your lack of insurance, I want to start with some basic blood tests and a urine sample to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… protein loss? Sounds serious. I don’t like the sound of any of that. But… I suppose you gotta do what you gotta do. Urine sample… yeah, I can manage that. Where do you want me to…? Hopefully it won’t be a long wait to get the results. I ain’t one for sitting around, Doctor. And what will these tests cost? Just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Miner. It’s good to be prepared. I want to assure you we’re starting with the basics to get a clearer picture. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they're available. As for the cost, I'll see if we can work with the clinic's financial assistance program and see if there are any options available to help reduce the burden. I don't have an exact figure right now, but I'll have the staff look into it for you after the tests. If you’ll follow me, there’s a bathroom down the hall where you can provide a urine sample. I'll give you a sterile container. Then we'll get the blood draw done here in the exam room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… financial assistance sounds good. I appreciate that. Fine. Let’s get it over with, then. Urine sample and blood draw… just hope it doesn’t take all day. Lead the way, Doctor. Just try not to poke around too much, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Miner. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll get through this. Here's the container, and I'll be right here when you're finished. Just let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: .
