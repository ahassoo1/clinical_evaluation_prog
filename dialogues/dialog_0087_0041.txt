DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting harder to do things, you see? Not all at once, but little by little. It’s been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. “Weakness, gradually worsening over time.” Could you tell me a bit more about that weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to start? It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Makes walking a bit… tricky. And sometimes my hands feel clumsy. Like I can’t hold things as steady as I used to. It doesn’t hurt, not really. Just… doesn’t work right. It’s more noticeable when I’m tired, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness in the legs and hands, not associated with pain, and worsened with fatigue. And you said this has been going on for a “while now” – could you estimate how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… five years? Perhaps a little longer. It started so slowly, I didn’t really pay it much mind at first. Just thought I was getting old, you know? But it's definitely gotten worse in the last year or so. It’s… worrying me a bit now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dorman. Five years of gradually worsening weakness, with a noticeable increase in the last year. That’s important information. To help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t had much trouble, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such. Nothing serious. Years ago, I broke my arm playing football, but that healed just fine. And… oh, a few years back, the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, so I was on some pills for a while. But I stopped taking them, I don’t remember exactly when. Felt a little better when I did, to be honest. Other than that… not much. I do have something else… a neurologist told me a long time ago I had… Multiple Sclerosis. I don’t really remember much about it, though. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. History of hypertension, past diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis – and you stopped taking the blood pressure medication at some point. It’s good you mentioned that MS diagnosis. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with MS, and if you received any treatment for it at the time?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That was… a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? Or more? I was living in Honolulu then. The doctor did some tests, poked and prodded, and then told me I had MS. He gave me some shots, I think. And some pills. But honestly, Doctor, it was all a bit of a blur. I didn’t really understand it. And I felt okay for a long time after that, so I… well, I just sort of stopped going to the doctor about it. It didn't bother me. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. Twenty years ago with a diagnosis of MS and treatment with injections and oral medications, then no follow-up for a considerable period. That is helpful to know. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My mother, she had some trouble with her legs when she got older. Couldn’t walk very well towards the end. But she was very old, you see? I don’t know if that’s… the same thing. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my siblings… my sister, she had some arthritis in her hands, but that’s about it. Nothing else that I can think of, really. We didn’t talk much about sickness in my family. We just… got on with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Leg trouble in your mother and arthritis in your sister. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pills a long time ago. I take a little something for my knees, sometimes, when they bother me. It’s just an over-the-counter thing, you can get it at the store. And sometimes I take a vitamin, just a general one. But that’s about it. I don’t really like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no regular medications currently, occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for your knees and a general vitamin. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I’ve always been able to eat anything and take anything, without trouble. My wife always says I have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Dorman. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything… hurts. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dorman. I will explain everything as I go, and we’ll take it slow. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to assess your muscle strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. There you go. Not as strong as it used to be, I’m afraid. Getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. And now, I’m going to check your gait and balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There. It’s a bit… wobbly, isn’t it? I don’t like walking without something to hold onto these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I noticed a slightly unsteady gait and some difficulty with balance. Thank you, Dorman. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination findings, the weakness in your legs and hands, the diminished reflexes, and the unsteady gait are concerning. Given your past history of Multiple Sclerosis, it’s important to investigate whether this could be a relapse. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes for your weakness, and the MRI will allow us to see if there’s any activity in your central nervous system. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests and scans… Well, I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? MRI… is that the one where I have to lie in that loud machine? Yes, I remember that. Not very comfortable. Blood tests are fine. As long as they don’t take too much blood. And the MRI… well, I’ll try to be brave. Will it take long to get the results? And what if it is the MS acting up again? What then?
DOCTOR: Yes, the MRI involves lying in a somewhat noisy machine, and it can be a bit uncomfortable. We will do our best to make you as comfortable as possible. The blood tests will only require a small sample, and we should have the results back within a few days. The MRI results will take a bit longer, usually about a week. If the MRI confirms a relapse of MS, there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. These treatments can include intravenous medications, oral medications, and physical therapy. We will discuss all of the options with you in detail once we have the results. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. I will write you a referral for the blood work and the MRI. The MRI center will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. Just… try not to worry too much, you said? It's easy to get anxious, you know. I’ll try to stay positive. And I’ll wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. It’s understandable to be anxious, and I will do everything I can to support you throughout this process. Try to focus on taking care of yourself in the meantime. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Here are the referrals for the blood work and MRI. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, Dorman.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I'll see you later.
