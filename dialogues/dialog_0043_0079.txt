DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. HAINLEY. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Look, I don't usually bother doctors, but... I’ve been bruising so easily lately. It’s a bit worrying, seeing as I'm already on blood thinners.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. HAINLEY, and it’s good you came in to have this checked out, especially given you’re already taking blood thinners. That certainly warrants attention. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, they just… appear. Like, I bumped my arm on the kitchen counter a couple of days ago - nothing hard, really - and ended up with a bruise the size of my hand. And yesterday, just brushing against the doorframe, another one showed up on my leg. They’re not painful, not really, just… there. And bigger than they used to be, for the same little bumps. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. HAINLEY. Bruising that appears easily and is larger than usual, even with minor trauma, is definitely something we need to investigate. And you mentioned you're already on blood thinners. Could you tell me what medication you’re taking, and what it’s for?
PATIENT: It's called… Warfarin, I think. Yes, Warfarin. The doctor put me on it about six months ago. Something about my heart… atrial fibrillation, that's it. It makes my heart beat a little funny sometimes, and the Warfarin helps keep things stable. I take 5mg every evening. I try to remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. HAINLEY. That's very helpful. Atrial fibrillation is precisely why Warfarin is prescribed. It's good you’re being diligent with the medication, even with occasional lapses in memory. Now, regarding these bruises. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms alongside them?
PATIENT: No, not really. No bleeding gums or nosebleeds. No weird headaches. Just… the bruises. And feeling a little tired, but honestly, who isn't tired these days? I'm 47, work a stressful job... I figured that was it. It's just the bruising is new, and… noticeable. It’s got me a bit spooked, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Ms. HAINLEY. New symptoms, particularly when on medication like Warfarin, always deserve attention. It’s good you’re paying close attention to your body. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any other significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it. No major surgeries. I haven't been hospitalised for anything serious. Just the usual colds and flus, you know? I try to stay healthy, eat pretty well… mostly. Work keeps me busy, so I don't have much time for anything else. I haven't seen a doctor in… well, before this, six months ago when they started me on the Warfarin.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mum had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85, so it didn't do too much harm, I guess. Dad was fine, healthy as an ox, until he had a stroke a few years back. No history of bleeding disorders, as far as I know. Nothing anyone ever talked about, anyway. They weren't big on talking about… well, anything much, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. HAINLEY. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner now and then, maybe once a month, but that’s it. And drugs… absolutely not. I work in information security, you know? I have to keep a clear head. Plus, I just don't have time for any of that. Too much on my plate as it is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s very helpful to know, Ms. HAINLEY. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. It’s nothing regular, just when I remember. And occasionally, paracetamol for headaches, if they’re really bad. But other than that, no. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. I try to tough things out, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. HAINLEY, thank you for being so thorough. That gives me a pretty good picture of your overall health. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a closer look at these bruises and check for any other potential signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just get it over with quickly, if you don't mind. I have a meeting this afternoon, and I’m already running a bit late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. HAINLEY. I will be as efficient as possible. First, let's take a look at these bruises. Could you please point to the ones you mentioned, starting with the one on your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s right here. See? It's not exactly painful, but it's definitely noticeable. And it's still a bit tender to the touch. I bumped it on the kitchen counter, like I said. But it's bigger than it should be, for such a little bump.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, I see. It's a sizable hematoma. No signs of active bleeding or swelling extending beyond the immediate area. Now, could you show me the one on your leg?
PATIENT: It’s here. This one just appeared yesterday, I think. Brushing against the doorframe, nothing more. I didn’t even feel it, really. Just noticed it when I was getting ready for work. Again, a bit tender, but not really painful. It's just… worrying, you know? The size of them, and how easily they show up.
DOCTOR: Yes, another sizable hematoma. And as you mentioned, it appeared with minimal trauma. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline assessment. And then I’ll do a quick neurological exam to rule out any other underlying issues. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you can. I'm already stressing about getting back to work.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, Ms. HAINLEY, likely due to the stress you’re experiencing, but the rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and assess your neurological function. This will involve a few simple tests. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Is this okay? Should I just look at it? Or…? I don’t usually do this kind of thing. It’s a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Ms. HAINLEY. You’re doing great. Just follow my finger as smoothly as possible. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that okay? I'm trying, but I’m a little tense. I don’t want to mess anything up. Just tell me what to do, and I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs with a small hammer. This might be a little startling, but it shouldn't be painful. Just relax your arms and legs, and I’ll do the rest. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be functioning normally neurologically, which is reassuring. Now, let’s discuss these bruises and what could be causing them.
PATIENT: Okay. Finally. What do you think it is? I really need to get back to work. Is it something serious? I feel like I’m wasting time here. And… do I need to be worried about bleeding or something? I take this Warfarin… It makes me nervous, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. HAINLEY, and I appreciate your patience. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, being on Warfarin, and the ease with which you’re bruising, it’s important to investigate thoroughly. Based on the physical exam and your history, there are a few possibilities. The most likely explanation is that your Warfarin dosage may be slightly too high, leading to an increased risk of bleeding and bruising. However, we need to confirm this with a blood test to check your INR – that’s a measure of how long it takes your blood to clot. Less common, but important to rule out, are other causes of easy bruising, such as underlying blood disorders or vitamin deficiencies. We'll run some additional tests to be certain. For now, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel, including your INR, to assess your bleeding risk. We'll also check your vitamin levels.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests. Right. So, what does that mean? Do I need to go to the hospital? Do I need to stop taking the Warfarin? I really don't want to mess with that. I already feel a bit shaky as it is. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a meeting tomorrow, and I can't afford to be sick. This is just… great.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. HAINLEY, and I want to assure you that we're taking this seriously, but it doesn't necessarily mean a hospital visit or immediately stopping your Warfarin. Stopping your Warfarin abruptly can be dangerous, so we absolutely won't do that without a clear plan. We'll adjust your dosage if the INR is too high. For now, I’m going to order the blood tests, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a few days to discuss the results. Typically, the results are available within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that could lead to injury, and if you do happen to get injured, apply pressure to the area for at least 10-15 minutes. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. And… okay. Avoid injury. Apply pressure. Easy for you to say. I work in information security! I sit at a desk all day. So, just… wait for the results? And… if it is the Warfarin, will I be on it forever? Is there anything else I can do? I hate feeling like this. And… I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. HAINLEY, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Regarding your question about the Warfarin, whether you’ll be on it forever depends on the severity of your atrial fibrillation and your response to treatment. Some people are able to come off Warfarin with appropriate management, while others need to remain on it long-term to prevent strokes. We’ll discuss all your options once we have the test results. For now, there isn't much else you can do besides avoiding injury and monitoring for any unusual bleeding or bruising. We need the blood test results to get a clear picture of what's going on. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once you have the results, please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… try to get the results back quickly, okay? I really need to get this sorted. And… thanks, I guess. I have a meeting. I should go. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. HAINLEY. We will do our best to expedite the results. Have a safe trip to your meeting, and please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any unusual bleeding or symptoms. .
