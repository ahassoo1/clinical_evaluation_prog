DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. I woke up yesterday and… well, I can’t hear out of my right ear. And half my face feels like it's falling off. It's rather inconvenient, to put it mildly. Is that enough for a start?
DOCTOR: Inconvenient is… one way to put it, yes. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness are certainly concerning. Let’s get some details, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Ask your questions. But I assure you, I haven't been neglecting my health. I just… woke up like this. And as I said, I do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with the hearing loss. Was it sudden, as in, you went to sleep hearing normally and woke up with difficulty?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly that. As in, one minute everything was fine, the next… nothing. Like someone flipped a switch. Do I need to draw you a picture? It was overnight. A complete and utter loss, right ear. I haven’t been banging my head or anything, if that's what you were going to ask.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn’t going to ask about head trauma. Just establishing the timeline. And you haven’t experienced any ringing in either ear, dizziness, or nausea accompanying this hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing? No. Nausea? Goodness, no. I'm not a delicate flower. Just… the deafness. And this… droop. It's rather unsettling, frankly. I look like a bad impression of someone having a stroke. I don’t do dizziness, I'm quite steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: You mentioned a “droop.” Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Look at it! It's… lower. The corner of my mouth, the eyebrow… it doesn’t lift properly. It's very obvious, isn't it? I haven't been botoxing or anything. It’s a distinct asymmetry. Frankly, it’s quite alarming. Do you need me to make a face? I can assure you, it won't be pretty.
DOCTOR: Please close your eyes tightly for me. Now, raise your eyebrows as high as you can. And now, smile. Show me your teeth. I see what you mean. It appears you have weakness on the right side of your face. Based on this initial assessment, it sounds like you may be experiencing Bell’s Palsy. However, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Bell's…what now? Some sort of fancy name for being… paralyzed? Honestly, doctor, I haven't got time for medical jargon. Is it serious? Will I look like this forever? And more importantly, what can you do about it? Because if it involves weeks of therapy, you can forget it. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Bell’s Palsy is inflammation of the facial nerve, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's not permanently paralyzing in most cases, though the recovery timeframe varies. We'll need to conduct some tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other, more serious conditions like a stroke or a tumor. I'm going to order a blood test and, ideally, an MRI. For now, I'll prescribe a short course of corticosteroids to reduce the inflammation. They are more effective if started within 72 hours of symptom onset.
PATIENT: Cortico… steroids? Honestly, doctor, I prefer to avoid those things if possible. Are there no other options? And an MRI? That sounds… unpleasant. Very time-consuming, I presume? Look, I appreciate you telling me what might be wrong, but I'm not keen on a prolonged investigation. If it's not immediately life-threatening, I’d rather just… monitor it. And perhaps take some vitamins. Is that acceptable? I really must insist on keeping this as brief as possible.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, with all due respect, "monitoring it" and taking vitamins is not an appropriate course of action when dealing with potential facial nerve paralysis. While the prognosis is generally good, delaying diagnosis and treatment could affect your recovery. We need to rule out other possibilities. The MRI is essential to ensure this isn't something more serious. It's not pleasant, admittedly, but it's a necessary precaution. As for the steroids, they have potential side effects, yes, but the benefits outweigh the risks in most cases, especially when started early. I strongly advise against refusing these tests. If you insist, I will document your refusal in your chart, but I cannot, in good conscience, simply dismiss these symptoms without a proper workup.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Do what you must. But I expect a very quick turnaround. And I want a detailed explanation of the… risks. And side effects. Everything. And frankly, I expect a discount. This is incredibly inconvenient and disrupting my schedule. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better. And no waiting rooms. I haven't got time to sit around with… people. Let's just get it done.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll order the MRI immediately and have the lab draw the blood tests. The nurse will explain the potential side effects of the steroids in detail. As for a discount… I'll see what I can do. The nurse will be with you shortly to begin the testing process. Please refrain from making any sudden movements with your face until after the MRI. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Don't move my face. I'm perfectly capable of following simple instructions. Just… hurry it along, would you? And tell the nurse to be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And, honestly, try to be discreet. I do have a reputation to maintain. .
