DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… I keep getting… hot. My face, you know? It gets very red. Like… flushing. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s been going on a few weeks now, maybe a month. I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing – getting red in the face – for about a month now. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. It’s hard to say. It doesn’t seem to be after I eat anything special. Not after exercise either, I walk a little, but nothing big. Sometimes it happens when I’m… talking to people. Not always, but sometimes. And… sometimes when I’m just sitting, watching TV. It’s very strange. I don’t feel hot, just my face gets red.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be consistently related to food or exercise, and it happens in different situations – sometimes with social interaction, sometimes at rest. That does sound a little unusual. Does anything seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Let me think… worse? I don’t think so. It just happens. Better… if I go into a quiet room, maybe. When I’m alone, it goes away faster. But it always comes back, you know? It’s not like anything stops it, really. Just… time. It goes away on its own after a few minutes. It doesn’t hurt or anything, just… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it resolves on its own after a few minutes, and being alone seems to help. No pain or other symptoms accompanying it. Have you noticed if anything else happens when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, nothing really. Not that I’ve noticed. My heart doesn’t race. I don’t get dizzy. No sweating. Just… red face. Sometimes my neck gets a little warm too, but mostly just the face. Oh! And… sometimes I feel a little bit… nervous. But I don’t know if that causes it, or if the flushing makes me nervous. It’s hard to tell. It’s a little confusing, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, it is a little confusing. It's good you're trying to pinpoint what might be going on. So, face and sometimes neck warmth, no other symptoms like racing heart or dizziness, and a possible connection to feeling nervous. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to have high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said it was okay after I started walking more. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? I haven’t been to the doctor much since my wife… passed. I don’t really feel sick, you know? Just this flushing. I take a little something for my… nerves, sometimes. But nothing regular. It’s an old prescription. I don’t even remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that's managed with walking, and you occasionally take something for nerves, an old prescription you don't recall the name of. I understand not having been to the doctor much recently, especially with everything you've been through. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. I… I don't like hospitals, you know? My wife… she had a lot of problems. So I avoid them if I can. Nothing major ever wrong with me, thankfully. Just a little bit of this flushing now. It’s not so bad, but it’s… worrying. I just want to know what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Avoiding hospitals after difficult experiences is very common, and it’s good you’re taking this seriously and wanting to figure out what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to make all kinds of food. I never had a reaction to anything. I take a little allergy medicine sometimes for the dust, but that’s just during the spring. It’s not a bad allergy. Just a little sneezing. Nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you take something for seasonal dust allergies, just during the spring. Let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has had similar symptoms to what you're experiencing – flushing, redness, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother used to get… hot sometimes. She said it was just the weather. She lived in India, you know? It got very hot there. But I don’t think it was the same thing. She didn’t get red in the face, just… sweaty. My father, he had… heart problems. But I don’t think that’s related. Nobody else, not that I remember. My wife’s family… I didn’t know them very well. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I don’t really know much about their health.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your mother occasionally experienced feeling hot, but it wasn’t the same as your flushing, and your father had heart problems. That gives me something to work with. Now, a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. My wife didn’t like it. Alcohol… I used to have a little wine with dinner sometimes. But not much. I stopped after… well, after she passed. And no, no drugs. Never. I don't like those things. I just like my tea, you know? And walking. That’s it. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal past alcohol use, no recreational drugs, and you enjoy tea and walking. That's good to know. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It's okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing sounds clear, heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise seems regular. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little on the higher side, but not drastically so. I do see some mild redness in your cheeks and across your nose. No obvious broken capillaries at this time. Skin feels warm to the touch. I’m also going to check your pulse. Pulse is 88, a little fast, but regular. Okay, everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure and pulse are a bit elevated. The facial redness is definitely present. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it's difficult to say for sure what’s causing this. It could be several things, from rosacea to a reaction to something environmental, or even related to anxiety or stress. Given your history of high blood pressure, it's important to rule out any underlying cardiovascular issues as well. I think we should start with some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. I'd like to check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, and a basic metabolic panel. We can also check for any inflammatory markers. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. You think it might be my… nerves? I do worry a lot, I suppose. Especially since my wife… But I don’t want to bother you with that. So, blood work. Yes. That’s fine. And… how long will that take?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely okay to share what's on your mind, Enrique. Grief and stress can absolutely manifest physically, and it’s important to consider those factors. And you’re not bothering me at all. Okay, so we’ll do the blood work. It usually takes a few days to get the results back – typically 3-5 business days. I’ll have the lab draw the blood here in the clinic. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d like you to keep a little diary of when these flushing episodes happen. Note the time of day, what you were doing, what you were eating, and how you were feeling emotionally. That will help us identify any potential triggers. Also, it might be helpful to try some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or meditation, to see if that helps manage your stress levels. Would you like me to give you a referral to a therapist as well?
PATIENT: A therapist? Hmm… I don’t know. I’ve never been to one. I usually just… try to deal with things myself. But maybe… maybe it wouldn’t hurt. If you think it would help, then… yes. A referral would be good. And the diary… yes, I can do that. Write down when it happens. That makes sense. I’ll try to remember everything. So, blood work, diary, and a referral to a therapist. That sounds… like a plan. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. It takes courage to ask for help, and I’m glad you’re willing to explore these options. I’m going to print out a referral for a few therapists in the area who specialize in grief and stress management. I’ll also give you a form to track your flushing episodes. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. They’ll just need a small sample. After we get your blood work results back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, like dizziness, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… that covers everything. You explained it all very clearly, Doctor. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again for listening. I feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I’ll start the diary today. And I’ll look at the therapist referrals. I think… that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. I understand your anxiety, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Remember, taking care of yourself is important. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when your blood work results are back. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
