DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I’ve just… not been feeling quite right lately. Mostly, it’s my stomach. I get sick to my tummy pretty easily, and I don’t feel hungry like I used to. I get full after just a little bit of food, and it’s… worrying me some. I don't rightly remember when it started, just feels like it’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not feeling quite right” and changes in your appetite and feeling full quickly – that's definitely worth looking into. So, it’s mostly stomach issues then, nausea and early fullness. And you said it’s been going on for a while… can you give me a rough idea – weeks, months?
PATIENT: Oh dear, weeks and months… It feels like… maybe three, four months now? It's hard to say exactly. Time just… slips away, you know? I do remember it being worse a couple of weeks ago than it is now, but it still isn’t good. It just… makes me tired, and I worry about not getting enough to eat. I used to love a good meal, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, with some fluctuation, and a little better recently, but still concerning. And it's impacting your energy and appetite. That’s helpful to know. Besides the nausea and early fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, like I said. And… I think I've lost a little weight, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? Oh, and sometimes I get a little… heartburn, I suppose. It’s not bad, just a little burning in my chest after I eat. But that might just be from the food not sitting right, I don’t know. Everything feels a bit mixed up, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, possible weight loss, and some heartburn. The heartburn could certainly be related to the stomach issues. Let's talk a bit more about the food itself. Are there any particular foods that seem to make it worse, or any that you can eat without problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, it feels like most foods bother me now. Anything too rich or heavy definitely does. I used to enjoy a good fried chicken, but that’s out of the question now. Bland things… like toast or crackers… those are easier, but they don’t really fill me up. Soup is okay sometimes, but not always. It’s hard to say for sure, it seems to change from day to day. I try to eat small portions, but even then, I get full so quickly. It’s just… frustrating. I miss being able to enjoy a meal without worrying about getting sick.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s incredibly frustrating, especially when it’s unpredictable. Okay, so rich foods are problematic, bland foods are better, but not always satisfying, and small portions are needed. Have you noticed any bloating or changes in your bowel movements – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, my… bowel movements. Well, now you’re asking! I suppose they have been a little… irregular. Sometimes I’m a bit… stopped up, and other times… well, let's just say I don't get far from a restroom. It’s been a bit of both, really. Not terribly bad either way, just… not normal. It seems to go along with how I’m feeling, I guess. When my stomach is upset, that’s when it’s worse. I haven’t paid much attention to it, to be honest. I just figured it was part of feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so irregular bowel movements, fluctuating between constipation and diarrhea, related to your stomach symptoms. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… Well, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but that was taken care of. I’ve had the usual things, you know, high blood pressure, arthritis… nothing too serious. And… a few years back, I was told I have… cancer. It’s in my… well, somewhere inside. I’ve been getting treatment for it, but… I don’t always remember the details. It's been a while, and things get mixed up. That's about all I can recall, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of cancer with ongoing treatment. That’s important information. Do you remember what type of cancer you were diagnosed with, or what part of the body it was affecting?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the type… It was… something with my stomach, I think. Or maybe my intestines? The doctor told me, of course, but it was a long time ago, and I've got a terrible memory these days. It was one of the inside parts, anyway. They did some tests, and then they started the treatments. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I just know it was serious, and I’ve been trying to keep up with everything. I’m sorry I can't be more helpful, Doctor. My mind just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to apologize at all. It sounds like it was cancer affecting your gastrointestinal system, and you're currently undergoing treatment. That’s very important to know, especially given your current symptoms. Let’s talk about your medications. What medications are you currently taking, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, my… medications. That’s another hard one. I take a little pill every morning… a white one, I think. And sometimes, when I’m feeling particularly sick, the doctor gives me something for the nausea. It’s a little orange pill, I believe. And… something for my blood pressure, too. A blue one, perhaps? I get them all mixed up, honestly. I have a bag full of pills, and I just try to take what the doctor tells me to. I don’t always remember why I’m taking them, though. It's a bit of a mess, to be honest, Doctor. I rely on my daughter to help me with them sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, it sounds like you're taking a medication daily, something for nausea as needed, and something for your blood pressure. Given the complexity of your medications and history, and your trouble remembering specifics, let’s take a look at your electronic health record to get a clearer picture. Do you mind if I take a moment to review your records?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor! I’m so glad you can look that up. My poor mind just… isn’t up to keeping track of everything anymore. It would be a great help to know exactly what I’m taking, and what it's for. Please, take all the time you need. I'll just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, I've got a better picture now. You are being treated for colon cancer with a medication called Capecitabine, which you take orally. You also take Lisinopril for your blood pressure, and as needed, you've been prescribed Ondansetron for nausea. It seems the nausea is related to the chemotherapy. Your records also indicate some recent weight loss and fatigue, which we're definitely going to investigate. Now, to get a clearer idea of what's going on now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Anything you think will help is good with me. I’m glad you have all those details now, it makes me feel better knowing you know what’s going on. A physical exam sounds fine. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I trust your judgment completely, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is a little tender in the lower left quadrant, but no obvious masses. Your bowel sounds are a bit diminished, which could be related to the chemotherapy or the changes in your appetite. No significant swelling in your legs or feet. Okay, Raymonde. Physically, your exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from some tenderness and diminished bowel sounds. Given your history of colon cancer and current treatment, and your symptoms of nausea, early fullness, irregular bowel movements, fatigue, and weight loss, I suspect the symptoms are likely related to the chemotherapy, potentially causing some inflammation in the colon or changes in your gut microbiome. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function, as well as a complete blood count to assess for any signs of infection or anemia. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any infections or inflammation in your colon. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood work and a stool test… yes, that makes sense. I just want to know what’s going on, and if it’s something serious. If it’s the chemotherapy, well, I guess we’ll just have to deal with it. I trust your judgment completely. If you think those tests are necessary, then let’s do them. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m just glad you’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m ordering those tests now. The blood work can be done right here in the clinic today, and I’ll give you a container for the stool sample to take home. We’ll send it to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, bland meals as tolerated, and staying well hydrated. If your nausea gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please contact the office immediately. Here’s the requisition for your blood work, and this handout has some tips for dealing with nausea. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds… straightforward enough. Small meals, stay hydrated, and contact you if things get worse. You said a few days for the results? That’s good. I’m glad we’re getting this checked out. Thank you, Doctor Condray. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It really puts my mind at ease. I think that's all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let the lab draw your blood, and we'll be in touch with the results soon. Have a good day, and take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. I will. I’ll see you soon. .
