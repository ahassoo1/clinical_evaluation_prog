DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Annesley. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Annesley. Thank you for seeing me. Well… it's about the cancer. It’s… it’s been a little while since I was first told, and I wanted to… check things. Make sure we're still on the right track, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a check-in, especially after receiving news like that. To best understand where you're at now, could you tell me a bit more about the cancer you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… it was in my… my breast, I think. They did a biopsy and… and that’s when they told me. It was… stage two, I believe? I’m sorry, I don’t really remember all the details. It was a lot to take in. They started me on… pills, I think. And… some other treatments. I just… I want to make sure it hasn't spread. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, that's perfectly okay. It is a lot to process, and it’s common to not remember every single detail. Let’s see if we can clarify things. You mentioned pills and other treatments—do you recall the names of any of the medications you were prescribed?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no. They gave me so many. Little white ones, mostly, I think. And… a bigger one, maybe blue? I had to take them every day. And then I went for… radiation, I think it was? It was a machine… it wasn’t painful, but… it made me very tired. I don't remember the names of anything, I'm so sorry. I just… followed what the other doctors told me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Chellsea. Don’t apologize at all; it's very common to feel overwhelmed and not remember everything. We can look up your records to see the specific medications and treatments you received. Okay, it looks like you were diagnosed with Stage II Invasive Ductal Carcinoma of the left breast on February 15th, 2024. You completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin, followed by a lumpectomy on May 10th, 2024. Then, you had radiation therapy completed June 20th - July 18th, 2024, and are currently on Letrozole as adjuvant endocrine therapy. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That… that sounds right. The names… they’re coming back a little. Letrozole… I’m still taking that one, yes. Every day. So… is everything okay? Is the Letrozole working? That's what I'm mostly worried about, if it's still helping.
DOCTOR: That’s good, that you’re still on the Letrozole. It is important to continue that as prescribed. Your most recent oncology report, dated April 15th, 2025, indicated stable disease with no evidence of distant metastasis. However, that was several months ago. To get a clearer picture of how things are progressing, I'd like to do a thorough physical exam, including checking the surgical site and regional lymph nodes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… good. A physical exam is fine. I just… I worry sometimes. It's hard to not think about it, you know? But please, check everything you need to. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Chellsea, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We’ll take our time and do a careful examination. First, let's start with your surgical site. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to palpate the area around your left breast, checking for any lumps, thickening, or changes in the skin. I’ll also feel your lymph nodes under your arm and around your collarbone. This will help us assess for any signs of recurrence. I'll start on your left side, then we'll check the right side for comparison. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Just… be gentle, please. It sometimes feels… sensitive. But I understand you need to check properly.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, I’m feeling around the surgical scar now. It’s well-healed, with some expected firmness, which is normal after surgery. I don’t feel any new lumps or masses in the surrounding tissue. No new areas of concern here. Now, I’m going to feel your lymph nodes under your left arm. Your lymph nodes feel normal in size and consistency, without any swelling or tenderness. Alright, everything feels good so far on the left side. Now, I’m going to check the right side for comparison. This is just routine, to make sure everything feels symmetrical. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Symmetrical… right. I understand. Please, go ahead. It's good to be thorough. I just… I hope everything is still okay.
DOCTOR: Of course. Alright, the right breast feels normal, with no lumps or masses. The axillary lymph nodes also feel normal on this side. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs to make sure everything sounds clear. Your lungs sound clear bilaterally, with normal breath sounds. Based on the physical exam, everything feels good. However, it’s important to remember that this is just one part of the assessment. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to review your recent lab work and imaging results, if available. Do you know when your last blood tests and scans were done?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I think the last blood tests were… maybe a month ago? And the scan… the one with the machine… it was maybe two months ago. The oncology office scheduled them, I didn't really pay attention to the dates. They just called with the results, and everything was… stable, they said. But I can ask them to send the reports to you, if that would be helpful?
DOCTOR: That would be extremely helpful, Chellsea. Knowing the specific results will give us a better understanding of your current status. While we wait for those reports, let's discuss your current symptoms. Have you noticed any new pain, swelling, redness, or changes in your breast?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a little tired, but that could just be… life, you know? I've been working a lot. And… sometimes a little ache in my shoulder, but nothing major. It comes and goes. I don't think it's related. I haven't noticed anything new since the last appointment. Just… the usual tiredness. Is that… a bad sign? I get worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being so observant of your body, Chellsea, and it’s perfectly normal to worry. Tiredness and shoulder aches can be caused by many things, and aren't necessarily signs of cancer recurrence. However, it's important to rule everything out. To be thorough, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm pretty healthy, actually. I eat okay, I try to get some exercise when I can. And… I don't smoke or drink. The only thing… is the cancer, of course. But other than that, I'm okay. My doctor always said I was a healthy patient. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Chellsea. Being generally healthy is definitely a positive factor. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Letrozole. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. Nothing else regularly. Just the white pill, every day. Is that all you need to know for now? I feel like I'm taking up your time.
DOCTOR: You're not taking up my time at all, Chellsea. It's important to have a complete picture of your health, and you're doing a great job providing that information. Okay, one last thing – do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… as long as it’s not the Letrozole, of course! I have to take that one. Is that everything? I'm happy to answer any other questions you have.
DOCTOR: That’s great. Okay, so to summarize: you're currently on Letrozole, have no known allergies, and are generally healthy with no other medical conditions. You’ve been experiencing some fatigue and occasional shoulder aches, but no new pain, swelling, or redness in your breast. We’re waiting for your recent lab work and imaging results from your oncology office. Once I have those results, I can better assess your current status and discuss a plan moving forward. In the meantime, please continue taking your Letrozole as prescribed. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, especially pain, swelling, or redness in your breast, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor. And… thank you for explaining things so clearly. It makes me feel a little better knowing we're keeping an eye on it. I'll ask the oncology office to send the reports over right away. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. That’s what I’m here for. And you’re right to be proactive about your health. We’ll be in touch as soon as we receive the reports. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and take care.
