DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, doc, just…bloating, alright? It’s been happening. Feels like I’m gonna burst sometimes. Honestly, I don’t have time for a long chat about it. Just…fix it. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand you're feeling quite uncomfortable with the bloating, and you'd like to find a solution as quickly as possible. Of course. We’ll do our best. “Fixing it” is the goal! To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this bloating started?
PATIENT: When? Ugh. Honestly, I don’t really remember. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Look, I work long hours, I don't sit around keeping track of when my stomach puffs up. Does it matter? It’s happening now, that’s what matters. Is this going to be a whole interrogation? Because I got things to do.
DOCTOR: No interrogation, I promise. It's just that when things started can sometimes give us clues, but you’re right – the fact that it's happening now is most important. A few weeks is helpful, though. And you’re right to point that out. Let's focus on what's happening right now. Can you describe what the bloating feels like, exactly?
PATIENT: Feels like…pressure. Like a balloon, getting bigger and bigger. It's uncomfortable, obviously. And…gassy. A lot of gas. It’s…look, it’s not pleasant, okay? It happens after I eat, usually. But not always. Sometimes it just…starts. I don’t know. I'm a pile driver operator, not a doctor. I don't analyze my insides. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. "Pressure, like a balloon, with a lot of gas, often after eating but sometimes just starting on its own." That gives me a better picture. You mentioned it happens after eating – what kind of foods do you usually eat when you experience this?
PATIENT: What don’t I eat? I work hard, I eat what I can, when I can. Lots of…meat, usually. Big portions. Burgers, steaks, whatever’s fast. Sometimes pasta. Honestly, doc, I’m not one for salads and fancy stuff. It’s fuel, alright? Keeps me going. You need a lot of energy to swing a hammer all day. Are you going to tell me I need to change my diet? Because that’s not happening.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kristofik. And no, I'm not going to tell you that you need to change your diet right away. We’ll explore all possibilities. Sometimes, certain foods can exacerbate bloating. But let's not jump to conclusions. Now, besides the bloating and gas, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just from the job. Long days, you know? And… my stomach sometimes makes noises. Like, really loud noises. Embarrassing noises. But that's about it. I haven't been…sick or anything. No pain, besides the discomfort from the bloating. Look, I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. And thank you for letting me know about the tiredness and stomach noises. It’s good to have the full picture. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history… Honestly? Not really. I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Maybe a checkup when I was a kid, but nothing serious. After my wife… well, things just got busy. And I figured, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. I’m a strong guy, I usually work through stuff. I don’t go running to doctors for every little ache and pain. Do I need to list every cold I’ve ever had? Because that’s a waste of time. Is this important?
DOCTOR: I understand. And no, you certainly don’t need to list every cold you’ve ever had. It's good to know you generally stay healthy and work through things. Just to be sure, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been hospitalized. Like I said, I’m a strong guy. I’ve broken a few bones on the job, gotten stitches a couple times, but nothing that required a hospital stay. A little ice and a bandage usually did the trick. I’m telling you, doc, I’m wasting my time here. This feels like you’re just going through a checklist. Can we just…figure out what’s causing the bloating?
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, and I apologize if it feels like I’m just going through a checklist. I want to get to the bottom of this for you, and I am listening. This information does help me rule things out and get a clearer picture. Alright, let’s move on to something more practical. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just listening to your stomach and feeling around. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for this. But…fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick about it, okay? I got things to do. I'm not one for poking and prodding. Just tell me what you find, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem…active. A bit louder than usual, actually. And I'm feeling some mild distention, which is consistent with the bloating you've described. No significant tenderness to the touch, which is good. It does feel a little firm in the lower abdomen, but nothing overly concerning at this point. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be related to your diet, or simply some trapped gas. But to be thorough, I’d like to order a couple of simple blood tests, just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Look, I really don’t like needles. But… fine. If it gets me out of here faster, do it. Just… tell me when and where. And make it quick, alright? I've got a schedule to keep. I don't want to spend all day in a doctor's office. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? Are they going to take a whole gallon?
DOCTOR: No, nothing major, Mr. Kristofik. Just a standard complete blood count, to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, and a basic metabolic panel, to check your kidney and liver function. It’s just a couple of vials – definitely not a gallon! The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We can get it done right here in the clinic. How about we do it now, while you’re already here?
PATIENT: Now? Seriously? Can't I just…go home and think about it? Look, I'm a big guy, alright? I can handle a little bloating. It'll probably pass on its own. But… fine. Get it over with. Just don't poke me too much. And tell me when I can leave. I've got things to do, remember? This is really cutting into my day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your frustration. Let's get this over with quickly. I'll have the phlebotomist come in right away. It will only take a few minutes, and then we can discuss the results and a plan of action. Could I have a phlebotomist to room three, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry up. And tell them to be gentle, alright? I don't want any surprises. This whole thing is a waste of time, but…let's just get it done. I need to get back to work. Seriously. .
DOCTOR: I'll make sure they are. They are very experienced and gentle. It won't be long now. .
