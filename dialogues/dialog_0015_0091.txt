DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, things just… not right. I does be feeling awful thirsty, all the time. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It not making sense, you know?
DOCTOR: “Awful thirsty and hungry, even after eating.” Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It start slow, but it getting worse each week. I does drink a lot of water, more than usual, and still feeling dry. And I does eat, eat, eat… but the hunger come back quick, quick.
DOCTOR: Three to four weeks… and this increased thirst and hunger is impacting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it really is. I does have to stop what I doing, go get water. And I does be thinking about food all the time, even when I just finish eating! It distracting me from my work, you know? Running the pumps is important work, can’t be forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Pumps, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I work the water pumps for the village. Important job, keeping everyone with water. I does check them, make sure everything running smooth. But this thirst… and hunger… making it hard to concentrate. I does worry I does miss something important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I does feel a little tired sometimes, but I does work hard. And maybe… maybe I does go to the bathroom more often, yes. But I thought that was just from the water I does be drinking! It hard to say, you know? I not sure what normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Increased urination… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? No, not really. Everything look the same to me. I does wear glasses, you know, for reading, but they working fine. I had them checked last year. I not seeing blurry or anything like that. Why you asking about my eyes, Doctor? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Zicarelli. We have to rule out all possibilities. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with nothing. I does try to eat healthy, mostly. I does get a little tired sometimes, but I always thought that was just from working hard. My husband, he does take care of me, make sure I does rest when I need to. He always says I does push myself too hard. But I always been strong, you know? Never really been sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she does have a little trouble with her sugar, yes. The doctor say it’s “borderline,” whatever that mean. And my father, he does have high blood pressure, yes. He does take pills for it, now. But that’s all I can think of, Doctor. My other family, they mostly healthy.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I does eat everything, mostly. Sometimes I get a little gas from the beans, but that’s not an allergy, is it? My husband, he does be teasing me about the beans! He says I does clear the room, but I does love a good plate of beans. But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I does not take nothing. I does try to eat healthy, get enough sleep. My husband, he does give me a little tonic sometimes, for my tiredness. It made with roots and herbs, he does get it from the village elder. But that’s all. Nothing the doctor give me, no.
DOCTOR: Ms. Zicarelli, it’s important you tell me everything you’re taking, even if it’s something you consider “natural.” These herbal remedies can interact with other medications, or even cause problems on their own. What exactly is in this tonic your husband gives you?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, he does say it's for strength, you know? He does get it from Old Man Hemmings, he know all the plants. It got… hmm… sarsaparilla root, he say. And some bush tea, I think. And something called “strong back vine,” he say it good for the bones. It does taste bitter, but I does trust my husband. He does be taking care of me for a long time. I just want to feel better, Doctor. I does not understand why I does feel so thirsty and hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to run some tests to determine what's going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urine analysis. We'll also need to check your blood sugar levels. Please have a seat while I write up the orders. I'll need to draw some blood and collect a urine sample. Don’t drink or eat anything else until after the blood work.
PATIENT: Oh, alright Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I does trust you. Blood work, you say? That not so bad. I does get poked sometimes at the clinic, for the checkups. No eating, you say? That might be hard. I does get hungry quick. But I does do what you say, Doctor. Just want to know what's wrong, you know? Is it something serious? I does worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s best to rule everything out, Ms. Zicarelli. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will take care of you. Please take this to the lab, and let me know when you’re finished. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to relax. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. Thank you. Down the hall, you say? Is it far? And… how long does it take? I does have work to do this afternoon. But I does do what you say, Doctor. Thank you.
