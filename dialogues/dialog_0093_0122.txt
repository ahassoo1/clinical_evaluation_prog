DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am Venus Alvara. I have been… noticing some things with my memory. It is… concerning. Especially with my blood pressure, you understand. It is… difficult to explain, but I thought it best to have it checked.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. It’s wise to address these concerns, and you’re right, memory issues and blood pressure can be interconnected. When you say “noticing some things,” could you elaborate a bit?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It is… small things, mostly. I will remember… a detail from yesterday, very clearly. But then… forget where I placed my keys, even though I just had them. Or… the name of a neighbor I see every day. It is… frustrating, and I do not like it. It feels… unlike me. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Alvara, thank you. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with recent memory, specifically recalling names and misplacing items, while your recall of past events seems intact. That distinction is important. And it's perfectly understandable why this would be frustrating. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Approximately… hmm. It is… difficult to say precisely. Perhaps… three months ago? Maybe four? It started slowly, so I did not… pay much attention at first. I thought it was just… being busy, you understand? But it has become… more frequent lately. More… noticeable. I do remember forgetting a friend’s birthday in June… a very close friend. That… bothered me greatly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly three to four months ago, with a gradual increase in frequency, and the incident with your friend's birthday in June was a particularly concerning moment. That's helpful information. Now, Ms. Alvara, aside from the memory concerns, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My… vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I have always had… imperfect eyesight. I wear glasses, as you can see. And… occasionally, I feel a little… unsteady on my feet, but I thought that was just… getting older. I do not fall, thankfully. My hands… sometimes they feel a little… numb, but only briefly. Is that… relevant? I do not wish to… burden you with unnecessary details.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, you’re not burdening me at all. These details are very relevant, thank you for sharing them. The blurry vision, occasional unsteadiness, and numbness in your hands – these are all important pieces of the puzzle. Just to clarify about the unsteadiness, does this happen when you’re standing still, walking, or changing positions?
PATIENT: Changing positions… yes, I believe so. When I stand up quickly, sometimes I feel… a little lightheaded. And then… unsteady for a moment. It does not last long, just… a few seconds. And… I must be careful. I do not want to… fall. It is not frequent, thankfully. Perhaps… once a week? Maybe less. But it is… worrisome. I have always been… very steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Alright, so the unsteadiness seems to be positional, occurring when standing quickly, lasting a few seconds, and happening perhaps once a week. That's good information. Now, Ms. Alvara, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic… medical conditions. Yes. I have… high blood pressure, as I mentioned. It has been… managed with medication for many years. My doctor… he retired last year, so I have been… seeing a new physician, but he is… very busy. And… I had a surgery on my knee… five years ago. A small tear, but it… required repair. Otherwise… no. I do not… believe so. I try to… eat healthy, and I walk every day, when the weather allows.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a knee surgery five years ago. I see a note here about a primary care physician change last year as well. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Recalling… yes. Let me think… It is… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes, when my blood pressure is… very high, my previous doctor would prescribe… Hydrochlorothiazide. A small dose, only when needed. But the new doctor… he has not… adjusted the medication yet. I have an appointment with him next month. He is… a very busy man. I do not wish to… trouble him with small things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 10mg daily and Hydrochlorothiazide as needed. Thank you for that information. Now, Ms. Alvara, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I do not… believe so. I have never… reacted badly to any medication. And… no food allergies. I eat… most things. Sometimes, my skin is… a little sensitive, but that is… just from the cold weather. I live in… a rural area, you understand. It gets… very cold in the winter. Is that… relevant? I do not wish to… waste your time.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, you are not wasting my time at all. This is all very helpful information. No known allergies. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, dementia, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had… heart problems. She passed away… ten years ago. From… a heart attack. And… my father… he had… diabetes. He was… very sick for many years. My sister… she has… high blood pressure, like me. Otherwise… no. Not that I… recall. My family is… not very large. And we do not… talk much about… medical things. It is… considered impolite, perhaps. Is that… helpful? I apologize if I… am not very informative.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Alvara. A history of heart disease in your mother, diabetes in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. It sounds like there’s a familial predisposition to cardiovascular issues. Finally, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… yes. I am… widowed. My husband… passed away five years ago. It was… very sudden. I live… alone in a small house. I have… a few friends, but we do not… see each other often. I enjoy… gardening, and reading. And… walking, when the weather is… pleasant. I do not… smoke. And I drink… very little alcohol. Perhaps… a glass of wine with dinner, once a week. Is that… sufficient? I do not have… a very exciting life.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly sufficient, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you enjoy a quiet, peaceful life. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also check your neurological function – your reflexes, balance, and coordination – and do a quick assessment of your vision. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor Bakan. That… sounds reasonable. Yes, you may… proceed. I trust your… judgment. Please… do not hesitate to… ask if I feel… uncomfortable. I want to… understand what is… happening. And I appreciate… your time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 150 over 90. It's not drastically high, but it’s something we’ll want to monitor. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's faint, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, particularly in your legs, and I noticed a little unsteadiness when you walked heel-to-toe. Vision is a little blurry, as you mentioned. Alright, Ms. Alvara. Based on this brief examination, your blood pressure is elevated, I detected a faint heart murmur, and there’s some mild unsteadiness and diminished reflexes, along with slightly reduced vision. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms, suggest a few possibilities we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate… further? What… possibilities? Is it… serious? I do not… wish to… worry unnecessarily. I understand… you need to… be thorough, but I am… a bit anxious now. My… husband… he always said… I worry too much. Is it… the blood pressure? Is that… causing the memory problems?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Alvara, and I want to assure you that we're being thorough, not assuming the worst. It’s good that you’re proactive about your health. Regarding your question about the blood pressure and memory problems, high blood pressure can contribute to cognitive issues, particularly over the long term. However, it’s not the only possibility. The symptoms you’re describing – memory loss combined with unsteadiness, vision changes, and a murmur – could suggest several things. One possibility is vascular dementia, which can occur from reduced blood flow to the brain. Another is a condition called orthostatic hypotension, where your blood pressure drops significantly when you stand up, causing dizziness and unsteadiness. A heart murmur could indicate underlying heart valve issues affecting blood flow. Because of these possibilities, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and an MRI of your brain to assess for any structural changes. We should also repeat your blood pressure measurements at different times of the day to see if it fluctuates significantly. Do that sound… acceptable?
PATIENT: MRI… of the brain? That… sounds… frightening. Is it… absolutely necessary? I do not… wish to… undergo unnecessary procedures. And… an EKG… is that… painful? I have always… been a little nervous around… medical equipment. I understand… you are the doctor, but I… feel overwhelmed now. Perhaps… we could start with… just the blood tests? And… the EKG? I do not… want to… rush into anything.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Ms. Alvara. An MRI can feel daunting, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about it. It’s not painful, but it does involve lying in a somewhat confined space for a period of time. We can certainly discuss options to help manage any anxiety if we proceed with it, such as medication or an open MRI, which is less enclosed. However, you are right. We can start with the less invasive tests first. Let’s begin with the complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel. These will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. An EKG is also relatively quick and painless; it simply involves placing electrodes on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. We can review the results of these tests, and then we can decide if further imaging, such as the MRI, is necessary. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds much… more reasonable. The blood tests… and the EKG… yes. I can… manage those. I do not… wish to… rush into anything. And… I trust your… judgment. What… about the memory problems? Is there… anything I can… do in the meantime? Any… exercises or… supplements? I have read… many things online, but I do not… know what to… believe. Is there… a specialist I could… see? A neurologist, perhaps?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Ms. Alvara. In the meantime, while we await the test results, there are a few things you can do. Firstly, ensure you’re staying well-hydrated and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. Regular, gentle exercise – like walking – is also beneficial for brain health. Regarding memory exercises, cognitive stimulation is helpful. Things like puzzles, reading, learning a new skill, or social interaction can help keep your brain active. There are also brain training apps available, but the evidence on their effectiveness varies. As for supplements, there's limited evidence to support most claims. Some studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may have some benefit, but it’s best to discuss any supplements with me before starting them. And you are right, seeing a neurologist is a good idea. I can definitely provide you with a referral to a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. It’s best to have a specialist evaluate your memory issues and determine the best course of action. I will write that referral today. Would you like me to also provide you with a list of resources for cognitive exercises and brain health tips?
PATIENT: A list of resources… yes, that… would be… very helpful. And… the referral to the neurologist… please. I appreciate… your… thoroughness. And… your… patience. I have always… been a bit… anxious around… doctors. What… about the medication? Should I… continue taking the Lisinopril… as prescribed? Or… should I… stop? I do not… wish to… interfere with the tests. Perhaps… it is… masking the symptoms? I apologize… for all the questions. I just… want to… understand what is… happening.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all, Ms. Alvara. It’s perfectly normal to have questions, especially when you're feeling anxious. And you're right to think about the medication. Regarding the Lisinopril, I recommend continuing to take it as prescribed unless I specifically advise you otherwise. Stopping it abruptly could cause a significant fluctuation in your blood pressure, which would interfere with the test results. It’s unlikely to significantly mask any underlying neurological symptoms. However, please let me know immediately if you experience any side effects, such as dizziness or lightheadedness, after taking the medication. We can discuss adjusting the dose if necessary. I'll also make a note in your chart to review your medication list with the neurologist. Now, let's get the orders for the blood tests and EKG sent to the lab. I’ll also prepare the referral to the neurologist and the list of resources for you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I believe… that is… everything. Thank you… Doctor Bakan. You have… been very… helpful. And… patient. I feel… a little… less anxious now. Perhaps… a little… overwhelmed, but… less anxious.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the test results once they’re available. Have a good day, and take care.
