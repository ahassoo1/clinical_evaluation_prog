DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osterholm, it's… it's been a little trouble with my water. Or, not gettin' all of it out, you see. It just… stays there, kinda. It's been happenin' more and more lately.
DOCTOR: "Stays there, kinda." Right. Okay. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not sure, exactly. Maybe… a couple months now? It started slow, I didn’t think much of it. Just figured I was drinkin’ too much tea, maybe. But now… now it’s hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. And is it… all liquids, or certain ones more than others?
PATIENT: No, not just certain ones. Water, tea… even soda, if I have some. It's all the same, really. Doesn't seem to matter what I drink. It just… doesn’t all go through.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any pain or burning when you… try to go?
PATIENT: Not exactly pain, Doctor. More… a little discomfort, sometimes. Like it’s gotta work a little harder, you know? But no burnin’ or nothin’ like that. Just… stuck. That's the best way to put it, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any fever, chills, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my appetite’s been alright, I think. Still eat my fish and berries like always. Maybe not as much bread as I used to, but that's just 'cause it doesn’t sit so well these days. Nothin’ to do with feelin’ sick, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve always been a pretty strong fella. Had a bit of trouble with my heart a few years back, but that cleared up. Mostly just… gettin’ old, I suppose. My wife, bless her soul, she took care of most everything. I don’t… I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: "A bit of trouble with your heart." Do you recall what kind of trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm. It was… somethin’ with the rhythm, I think. Palpitations, the doctor called 'em. It wasn't too bad, just fluttered sometimes. They gave me some pills, and it went away. Like I said, it was a long time ago. My wife, she kept track of everything. I just know they said it was my heart.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Never had any surgeries. Always been lucky enough to avoid those. Just a few scrapes and bruises over the years, from workin’ on the boats. Nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well… my wife passed away five years ago. We didn’t have any children, sadly. She had a sister, lives down in Anchorage, but we haven't spoken in a while. I had a brother, but he… he's gone now too. So, not much family left, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I don't take nothin'. Haven't needed to, thankfully. Just try to eat right and get my rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’m going to need to examine your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That sounds… alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I'll need you to lie down on your back. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but with mild distension. No masses palpated. I'm also going to need to check your prostate. It's a standard part of the exam for men your age.
PATIENT: My… my prostate? Oh. Well… I suppose if you need to, Doctor. I… I don't like that part much, if I'm bein' honest. But if it’s important… then go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Prostate is mildly enlarged, but smooth and without nodules. Alright, Mr. Hilber. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is common as men age. It can cause difficulty emptying your bladder.
PATIENT: Ben-what? My… my prostate is… big? That's what's causin' this trouble? I don’t understand. Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Hilber. Many men experience BPH as they get older. It's rarely life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and inconvenient. Surgery is an option, but it's usually reserved for more severe cases. We can start with some less invasive treatments. I’d recommend a trial of medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder. We can also discuss some lifestyle changes that may help, like limiting fluids before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. We can also do a urine test to rule out any infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Medication… that sounds… better than surgery, for sure. And lifestyle changes… I can try that, yes. Limiting fluids… and no more tea before bed, I guess. It’s just… it’s hard to give up my tea. But if it helps… yes. A urine test… that's alright too. I just want to get this fixed, Doctor. I don’t want to have to worry about this all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. I’m going to order a urine analysis for you. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. I'll also write you a prescription for tamsulosin, a medication that helps relax the muscles in your prostate. Take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or difficulty urinating, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Tamsulosin… alright. And a follow-up in a month… yes, that sounds good. Side effects… what kind of side effects should I be lookin’ for, Doctor? And… is this somethin’ that gets worse over time? Will I eventually need surgery no matter what?
DOCTOR: The most common side effects of tamsulosin are dizziness, lightheadedness, and a stuffy nose. Sometimes, it can cause retrograde ejaculation, which means the semen goes into the bladder instead of out during intercourse. It's not harmful, but some men find it unpleasant. As for whether it gets worse over time… it can, but it doesn’t always. Many men manage their symptoms effectively with medication and lifestyle changes for years. If the medication stops working or the symptoms become severe, then we can discuss other options, including surgery. But let's not worry about surgery right now. We’ll start with this medication and see how you respond. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dizziness… and a stuffy nose… and… the other thing. Yes, I think I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. Alright. I’ll take the medication, and I’ll try to limit my tea. And I’ll come back if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I appreciate you explainin’ everything to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. You're welcome. Here’s a copy of your visit summary with all the instructions and information we discussed. Please read it over carefully. And remember, if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. .
