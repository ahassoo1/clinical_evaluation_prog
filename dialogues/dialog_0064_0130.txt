DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mom, she had something bad with her heart. So, I just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want anything bad to happen to me. It worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. It's good you're thinking about this. We'll certainly do our best to assess everything. So, to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about your health?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I’m 73. I try to eat okay, mostly. Not much fast food. I walk a little, but my knees bother me sometimes. I used to be stronger, but… things happen, you know? I sell things, wholesale mostly. Lots of driving. Never been a smoker. Drink a little beer now and then, but not every day. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That's a good start, thank you. Knowing about the driving is helpful. And it sounds like you’ve generally taken good care of yourself. You mentioned your knees bothering you. Is that a recent thing, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees… it's been a while. Years, really. Gets worse when it’s cold, or if I walk too much. Doctor said something about… arthritis, I think? Gave me some pills for it. They help some, but not always. It's just… old age, I guess. It’s not bad bad, just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis… that's helpful to know. And it's good that you've seen a doctor for that previously and have been managing it. We'll want to get a full picture of your medical history, so if you can remember any details about that diagnosis or treatment, that would be great. Now, apart from your knees, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get tired easier than I used to, but who doesn’t at my age? Sometimes my stomach feels funny, like… bloated, maybe? Not pain, just… uncomfortable. And I cough a little, especially in the mornings. But I always have, a little bit. It’s probably just… dust, you know? I live near a field. I don't know. Nothing major, I don't think. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's all very good information, Mr. Schwer. Even things that seem small can be important. The tiredness, bloating, and cough…we’ll want to look into those a bit more. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… not really. I think I’ve lost a little, but I haven’t been keeping track. Maybe five, ten pounds? I'm a skinny guy anyway. Always have been. It's probably just old age, or not eating as much. I used to have a bigger appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight unintentional weight loss. That’s worth noting. Now, before we move on to your family history, let me ask about any allergies you have. Any reactions to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had a problem with food. Sometimes my skin gets itchy, but that happens when it’s cold and dry. Doctor gave me some cream for that. I don't think I'm allergic to anything serious. No trouble with any pills I've taken before. Is penicillin one of those you ask about? I think I took that once, years ago, and I was okay.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Schwer. Penicillin is a common one we ask about, so you’re right to think of that. It sounds like you haven't had any significant allergic reactions. Now, let's talk about your family history. You mentioned your sister and mother having health problems. Can you tell me more about what they were diagnosed with, if you know?
PATIENT: Okay. My sister, she got cancer… lung cancer. Real bad. She… she didn’t make it. That was maybe five years ago? They said it spread everywhere. My mom… she had something with her heart. It was a long time ago. She was always tired, and then her legs swelled up. They said it was… congestive something? She was in the hospital a lot. She died when I was still young, maybe 20 years old. I don't remember much about it. Is that enough? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Schwer, thank you for sharing that, even though it’s difficult. I’m sorry for your losses. It’s understandable you don’t remember all the details, but knowing about the lung cancer and congestive heart failure is important. Do you have any other close family members—brothers, sisters, parents—who experienced significant health issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… My dad… he was strong, worked hard all his life. He died when he was old, something with his kidneys, I think? Just… old age, mostly. I don’t think he had any real sickness. He was a tough man. And… I had a brother, but he died when he was a baby. Never knew him. No one else, really. My wife… she left me. Had some problems, but not sickness. It's mostly just me now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Schwer. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription medications regularly, even for things like blood pressure or cholesterol?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my knees. Arthritis. Something… -profen. Ibu-something. And the cream for my skin when it gets itchy. That’s it. I used to take something for my stomach, but the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. I don't like taking too many pills. They make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees and the cream for your skin. And you previously used medication for your stomach. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Is it going to hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Schwer. Just listening with my stethoscope and a quick look. It shouldn’t hurt at all. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your heart sounds a little… distant. Not a strong beat. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, especially on the right side. I'm going to feel your knees now. There’s some swelling and tenderness in both knees, as you mentioned. And some limited range of motion. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Now I would like to order some blood tests and a chest x-ray. Would that be ok with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an x-ray? Is something wrong, Doctor? What are you looking for? I don’t like hospitals… or tests. Are you sure you need all that? Can't you just tell me what's wrong without doing all that stuff?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It's completely normal to feel anxious about tests. I’m not trying to alarm you. The tests aren’t to confirm anything specific at this point. They are to get a better overall picture of what’s going on and help us rule out any potential causes for your symptoms - the tiredness, the slight weight loss, the wheezing in your lungs, and the elevated blood pressure. The blood tests will check things like your blood count, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. The chest x-ray will let us see your lungs more clearly. It’s better to be thorough and have as much information as possible, especially given your family history. It will help me to make the best decisions about your care. Would you like me to explain anything further or perhaps go over the potential risks and benefits of each test?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. You’re right. Better to be safe. I just… I don’t like going to the hospital. It makes me nervous. But… if you think it's necessary. The chest x-ray… does it hurt? And the blood tests… will they take a lot? I get faint sometimes when they take blood.
DOCTOR: The chest x-ray doesn't involve any needles or pain at all. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine, and it takes a picture of your lungs. It’s very quick and painless. As for the blood tests, we'll only need a small sample. We’ll have you lie down for the blood draw, and the nurse is very experienced at drawing blood. If you feel faint, let her know immediately, and she can stop the draw. We can also have you lie down for a bit afterward to ensure you feel okay. It won't take long – maybe 10-15 minutes total. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Ten minutes… and I lie down. That sounds better. And the nurse is good? You said she's good. When can we do it? I don’t want to wait too long, but I also don’t want to rush.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Our nurses are very skilled and experienced. I can personally assure you she is excellent. We can do the blood tests and chest x-ray today if you’d like. We have an x-ray technician available this afternoon. The blood tests can be done in the lab right next door. Would 2:00 PM work for you?
PATIENT: 2:00 PM… yes. That's fine. As long as I can lie down for the blood tests. And… is it okay if I bring my daughter? She worries about me too. Maybe she can come with me. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. You’re very welcome to bring your daughter with you. Having someone there for support is always a good idea. So, to confirm: 2:00 PM today for the blood tests and chest x-ray. Your daughter is welcome to join you. I’ll have the nurse prepare everything for your blood draw and ensure you have a comfortable place to lie down. Before you go, do you have any other questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And thank you for letting my daughter come. That makes me feel a little better. I guess I’ll see you later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Remember, we’re here to support you. I’ll see you this afternoon. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions before then. Have a good day until then.
