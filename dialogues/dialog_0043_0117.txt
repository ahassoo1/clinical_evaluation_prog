DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough. Been coughin’ up some… stuff. Red stuff. Not good. I smoke, you see. Don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a bit now. I just want it to… stop, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Reyno. A cough producing red material is certainly something we need to investigate. And thank you for being upfront about your smoking history – that’s very important information. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s… deep. Feels like it’s comin’ from way down. Happens mostly in the mornin’. When I first wake up. Sometimes during the day if I… push myself too hard. Work's kinda physical, you see. Power lines… it ain't sittin’ in an office. How much more you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. That gives me a clearer picture. A deep cough that's worse in the morning and with exertion is helpful information. Now, when you say "red stuff," could you describe it a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precise… uh. It’s… not a lot. Like, not a whole lot each time. More like streaks. Streaks in the mucus. Bright red. Sometimes… darker. Like old red. I don't… I don’t know how to explain it better. It ain’t a flood, Doctor. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Reyno. Streaks of bright and darker red in your mucus, not a large amount, but consistently present. I appreciate you being so specific, even though it’s difficult to describe. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get kinda tired, maybe. But work’s tiring. Hard to tell if that’s… you know. No fever, I don’t think. No chills. Sometimes a little short of breath when I'm climbin’ poles. But that happens too. Gets hard up there. Not… new, though.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. Fatigue, shortness of breath with exertion—specifically when climbing poles, which you’ve experienced before—and no fever or chills. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or lung disease?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Doc told me somethin’ years back, somethin’ about my blood pressure. Said to watch it. But I don't really… go to the doctor much. Medicare covers stuff, but still. Don’t think I got anythin’ bad. Never been told I had lung problems. Just the smokin’.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. So you were told about high blood pressure in the past, but haven't been regularly monitored for it. And no previous diagnosis of lung disease. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… nope. Never had surgery. Not that I recall, anyway. Hospital… maybe when I was a kid. Somethin’ with my appendix, I think? Real young. Don’t remember much. A long time ago. That doesn’t count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't count, Mr. Reyno. Thank you for letting me know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health problems that run in your family—like heart disease, lung cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family… uh. My momma, she… she had trouble breathin’ when she got older. Real older. Think it was her lungs. She smoked too. My grandpa… he had somethin’ with his heart, I think. But everybody smoked back then. Hard to say what was what, you know? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. A history of breathing problems and heart disease in your family, both with members who smoked, is important information. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just… nothin’. Don't take nothin’ regularly. Maybe some aspirin if my head hurts. But that's it. No pills, no nothin’. I try to stay away from that stuff if I can. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Reyno. So you don't take any regular medications, only aspirin occasionally for headaches. And you have no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… nope. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I've been stung by bees a few times workin’ outside, but nothin’ serious. Just a little swellin’. Not an allergy, right? Just… a sting.
DOCTOR: You are correct, Mr. Reyno. A local reaction to bee stings doesn’t count as a medication allergy. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to listen to your lungs and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Get it over with. Just… don't take too long, Doctor. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. I'll be as efficient as possible. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. I'm listening to your lungs now. I hear some wheezing, particularly on the lower lobes, and some diminished breath sounds in a few areas. The percussion is a bit dull over the lower lobes as well. Your heart rate is 78 and your blood pressure is 140/90. Your throat appears clear, and your oxygen saturation is 95%. Based on what you've told me and the findings of the exam, Mr. Reyno, it’s concerning. Your wheezing and diminished breath sounds, combined with the red-streaked mucus, suggest a possible respiratory issue, likely worsened by your smoking history. Your blood pressure is also a bit elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated… everything’s elevated. Look, Doc, is it bad? Is it somethin’ serious? I just want to know. Don't need a lot of fancy words. Just… bad or not bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, it’s not good, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s immediately life-threatening. However, it does require further investigation. The combination of your symptoms and exam findings is concerning enough that I want to rule out more serious possibilities, such as chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or even lung cancer. Given your smoking history, these are concerns we need to address proactively. To do that, I recommend a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test—a breathing test to measure how well your lungs are working. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Fine. Get ‘em done. Just… when will I know somethin’? I can’t be runnin’ back and forth to the doctor all the time. Got a job to do. And… how much will this cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Reyno. We can schedule the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test for tomorrow morning at the clinic. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, and I will personally review them as soon as they are available. I will then contact you directly with the findings—you won’t need to come back unless I specifically ask you to. Regarding the cost, since you have Medicare, your out-of-pocket expenses should be relatively low—likely just your standard copay for each test. Our billing department can give you a more precise estimate, and they can also verify your coverage to ensure there are no surprises. Would you like me to have them contact you?
PATIENT: Copay… alright. Just get it done. And yeah, have ‘em call. Don't need no surprises. Just… let me know if it's somethin’ I gotta worry about. Real quick. Don't beat around the bush.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Reyno. I understand. I will personally review the results and contact you directly as soon as possible with a clear explanation of the findings and any necessary next steps. I will not beat around the bush—you will get a straightforward answer. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity that causes shortness of breath. And I’d like to discuss smoking cessation options with you when you return—there are resources available that can help. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Acceptable… yeah. Fine. Just… don’t keep me waitin’. And… no lectures about the smokin’. I know it’s bad. Just tell me what the tests say.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Reyno. No lectures, I promise. I will prioritize getting those tests scheduled and the results to you as quickly as possible. Here’s a paper with the instructions for the pulmonary function test and the contact information for the billing department. They can answer any questions you have about costs. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Reyno. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms before we get the test results. .
