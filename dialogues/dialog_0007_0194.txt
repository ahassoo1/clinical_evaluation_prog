DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, Lani, she worried me into coming. Said I really should get it checked. It comes and goes, this… feeling. Hard to explain, really. I just… don’t hear well sometimes, and everything spins. It’s happened a few times now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and some dizziness, that’s good to know. And it comes and goes, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not all the time, thankfully. It’ll just… happen. Lasts a bit, then it’s gone. It’s just… unsettling. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s perfectly normal for memory to change as we get older. No worries at all about that. So, when it happens, would you describe it more as a fullness in your ears, ringing, or actual difficulty hearing things?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. That’s a good question. It’s not… ringing, not exactly. More like… everything gets muffled. Like someone turned the volume down real low. And it feels… inside my head, a bit. A pressure, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I just know I can’t hear properly when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing with a pressure sensation inside your head. And it’s intermittent, coming and going. Does anything seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Oh dear. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m busy, sometimes when I’m resting. I honestly can’t put my finger on it. My husband, bless him, used to say stress, but… well, that was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no clear triggers identified. And it doesn’t seem consistently related to activity level. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the muffled hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little bit unsteady on my feet after the spinning stops. Just for a little while, though. Not falling down or anything, just… not as balanced. And… oh, and sometimes my head aches a bit. Not a bad headache, just a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unsteady feeling after the dizziness and a dull headache sometimes. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these episodes?
PATIENT: Nausea…? Oh, no, not really. Maybe a little bit queasy sometimes, but nothing… dramatic. Definitely no vomiting. It’s more just… uncomfortable, the spinning and the not being able to hear. It scares me more than anything, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, no nausea or vomiting. Just the dizziness, muffled hearing, unsteady feeling afterwards, and occasional dull headache. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on some pills for a while, but I think I stopped taking them eventually. I can’t quite remember… Lani usually handles all that now. And… no, I don’t think so, nothing else major. My husband always kept on me to go to the doctor regularly, but…
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication. And you're currently not taking anything for it?
PATIENT: That's right. Not taking anything now. I… I should probably ask Lani about it, to be sure. She's very good at remembering things. But no, I don’t think I am currently on any medication. I used to, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And… I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. Fell down the steps, silly thing. But that was a long time ago. Nothing major since then, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist in the past. Now, thinking about your family… has anyone in your family had problems with hearing loss, dizziness, or balance issues?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother… she had trouble hearing in her later years, yes. Very bad, she needed a hearing aid. And… I think my uncle, on my father’s side, he used to get terrible vertigo, he said. Made him very sick. But that was a long time ago, I can’t remember the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of hearing loss and vertigo. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, bless him, he used to smoke a bit, but I always made sure he did it outside.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, I assure you. I don't really care for it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, very minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, are you currently experiencing any significant stress in your life?
PATIENT: Stress… well, it’s been a bit quiet since my husband passed. I miss him terribly, of course, but Lani is very good, she helps me out a lot. So… no, not really any major stress right now. Just… loneliness, sometimes. But that’s just life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Terasa. That gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll start by checking your ears, then I'll check your balance and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please. My ears are a little sensitive sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your ears. I’m just going to take a look inside, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. Just… don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay… Okay, I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, but nothing major. The ear drums themselves look… a little bit dull, but no signs of infection or perforation. Now, I'm going to do a quick balance test. I'll have you stand with your feet together and close your eyes, and I'll see if you can maintain your balance. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Feet together and close my eyes… Alright. Oh dear, I'm not very steady.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s perfectly normal. You’re a little unsteady, yes. And your coordination seems a bit off as well. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but not alarmingly high. Overall, everything seems… relatively normal, but the balance and coordination issues, along with the history of high blood pressure and the dull ear drums, are concerning. I think it's worth getting a hearing test and possibly an MRI to rule out any inner ear problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A hearing test, yes, that makes sense. But an MRI… is it necessary? Is it expensive? I… I don’t know, Doctor. I’d have to talk to Lani about that. She handles all the complicated things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Terasa. An MRI isn't necessarily something to be scared of, it's just a way for us to get a more detailed look inside your head and rule out anything serious, like a tumor or a problem with the inner ear. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially given your symptoms. And yes, it can be expensive, so talking to Lani about insurance coverage is a good idea. For now, let’s focus on the hearing test. I can write you a referral to an audiologist, and we can schedule that for you as soon as possible. I'll also put a note in your chart about the possibility of an MRI, and we can discuss it further after the hearing test results come back. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. A hearing test first, then we’ll see. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I do wish my memory was better, so I could remember all of this. Perhaps Lani can help me keep track of everything. A referral to an audiologist, you said? Alright. That sounds good.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It’s my job to be patient, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. Okay, I’m writing you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, she’s an excellent audiologist just a few miles from here. Here’s the referral slip, and it has her contact information. And here’s a summary of our conversation and the plan, for you and Lani. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I'll let Lani handle scheduling the appointment. Perhaps she can call tomorrow. I'm sure she'll have some questions, too. I think I'll just… go now. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
