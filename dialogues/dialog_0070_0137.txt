DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… they want me to get checked. For the… old people place. The senior living, yes? My husband, he thinks it’s good. I think so too, maybe. Just need… paper? To say I am okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, it sounds like you need a medical evaluation as part of the application process for the senior living facility. A general check-up to ensure you're healthy and able to benefit from their services. That’s perfectly alright. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Hmm… current health. I… I work. At the bar. Three nights a week. I make the drinks. Not too hard, you know? My knees, they sometimes… ache. And my back. But I take… pills. Little white pills. They help. And I… I get tired. More tired than before, maybe. But who doesn’t?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s good you’re still working; staying active is wonderful. You mentioned aches in your knees and back, and taking little white pills for them. Could you tell me a bit more about those pills?
PATIENT: Yes, the pills. My daughter, she gets them for me. From the… the pharmacy. She tells me what to take. One in the morning, one before work. And sometimes, if I really hurt, one before bed. I… I don’t know the name. She just… puts them in the bottle for me. It has a white cap.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We’ll definitely get a full list of your medications sorted out. And you mentioned getting more tired than before. Could you describe that tiredness a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe seven, eight hours. But… when I wake up, I don’t feel… fresh. Like I need another nap. And during the work… sometimes, I just… slow down. Forget what people order. Usually, I am very good. I know all the drinks. But lately… it takes more thinking. Not big things. Just… little things.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you’re sleeping a reasonable amount, but not feeling rested, and experiencing some difficulty with memory and concentration, particularly during work shifts. That's good information. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. No, not really. I eat. My husband, he cooks very good. Rice and beans, chicken, sometimes fish. I like to eat. Maybe… I don’t eat as much as before. But it’s not like I don't have appetite. I still enjoy food.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… oh dear. Maybe a little. My clothes… they feel a little loose. But I don’t… weigh myself. My husband, he does that. I don’t ask. He says I am… good.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can check your weight here today, if you’d like. It’s helpful information. And have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not a fever. I feel… warm sometimes. But that is the weather, you know? It is very hot. Chills… no, never. And night sweats… no. I sleep with a blanket. It gets cold at night.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’d like to ask about any other symptoms you might be experiencing. Have you had any problems with your vision, hearing, or balance?
PATIENT: Vision… a little blurry sometimes. But I have glasses. I wear them. And hearing… I ask people to repeat sometimes. But that is because they talk too soft. Or the bar is loud. Balance… no. I walk okay. I haven't fallen. Not recently.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control recently?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That is… a private question. I… I go to the bathroom like always. Maybe… a little more often. But… old people, they go more often, yes? It’s normal, I think.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older, Ms. Abdollahi. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, just a few more general questions. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not a pain. Sometimes, my heart… it feels like it skips a beat. But just for a second. And no shortness of breath. I breathe okay. Palpitations… I don’t know what that is. Does that mean… skipping beats?
DOCTOR: Palpitations can mean feeling like your heart is skipping a beat or fluttering. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing that occasionally. Now, before we move on to your past medical history, would you mind if I quickly take your temperature, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: No, no problem. You can do what you need. My husband, he always takes my blood pressure. It is… usually okay. But I get nervous at the doctor, so maybe it will be higher.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is normal. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's not uncommon when you're in a clinical setting. Your heart sounds regular, though I did detect a very slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor, back in Honduras, he said I had… high blood pressure. A long time ago. And… arthritis. In my knees. That’s why I take the pills. And I had… surgery. On my stomach. Many years ago. They took something out. I don’t remember what.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure diagnosed previously, arthritis in your knees, and a previous abdominal surgery. Do you recall roughly when you had the abdominal surgery?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… long ago. Maybe… twenty years ago? More? I don’t remember exactly. It was in Honduras. A different doctor. Everything was different then. I was younger. Much younger.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We don’t need an exact date. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. My husband, he cooks very good. Sometimes, my skin gets itchy. But that is the sun, I think. Or the soap. I don’t take many medicines. Just the white pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the white pills?
PATIENT: Just the white pills. Like I said, my daughter, she gives them to me. She puts them in the bottle. I don’t know any other medicines. Maybe… sometimes, I take something for a headache. But just when I have a headache. It’s a little blue pill. But not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you take the white pills regularly for your knees and back, and occasionally a blue pill for headaches. Do you know the names of either of these pills, or could we possibly get the bottles from your daughter?
PATIENT: No, I don’t know the names. My daughter, she will bring the bottles. She visits next week. She can tell you everything. She knows all the names. I just… take them. It's easier that way, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly get that information from your daughter when she visits. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had… high blood pressure. Like me. And my father… he had… diabetes. I think. He was sick for a long time. And my sister… she had… a problem with her heart. I don't remember what kind of problem. It was a long time ago. They all lived in Honduras.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and a heart condition. Now, before we finish up, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What is that? I live with my husband. We have a small house. I go to church on Sundays. And I visit my daughter sometimes. What kind of history do you want?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. I just meant, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no. No smoking. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stopped many years ago. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. And no… other things. Never. Just wine. Very little wine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, do you have any questions for me, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. You ask a lot of questions! I just hope… I am okay for the senior living place. I want to be comfortable. And not be a bother. Will I be okay?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern, Ms. Abdollahi. Based on our conversation today, you seem to be in relatively good health for your age. We still need to gather a bit more information – specifically, the names of your medications – but everything sounds manageable. We’ll do some blood work and a basic physical exam to get a clearer picture, and then we can discuss your options and make sure you’re comfortable and well-prepared for the senior living facility. For now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs again, and then I'll check your reflexes and strength. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. You are very kind, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age. Your strength is good, but a little weaker on your left side. Your heart sounds normal, though that slight murmur is still present. I'm not overly concerned about it at this point. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to check your basic health markers – things like your blood sugar, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as that can affect energy levels. Do you have any objections to having blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, no objections. I had blood drawn before. It doesn’t bother me. Just… a little pinch, yes? As long as it helps, that’s good.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little pinch. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, could you please try to bring the bottles of your medications with you when you see your daughter next week?
PATIENT: Yes, I will ask my daughter. She will bring them. She always remembers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You are very helpful. Is that all for today?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for today, Ms. Abdollahi. The nurse will come in shortly to give you some instructions about the blood work and schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel much better now. I hope I am okay for the senior living place. That is all I want.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll do everything we can to make sure you’re healthy and comfortable. I am optimistic. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
