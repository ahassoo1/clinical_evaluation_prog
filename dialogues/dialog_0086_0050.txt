DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been with me a long time now, feels like. A dry cough, mostly. Not much… not much coming up, you know? Just… scratchy.
DOCTOR: "A long time now," you say. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. That’s… hard. Years, I think. Maybe… five? Six? Before my wife, Eleanor… passed. Yes, before Eleanor. It was bothering me then, too. It comes and goes, mostly worse in the winter, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed about the cough recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. It feels… a little worse lately, maybe? Not a lot, but… I’ve been getting more tired, I suppose. Just… old age, probably. It takes more effort to do things now. But the cough… it just keeps me up at night sometimes. A little bit more than usual, I think.
DOCTOR: "Old age," right. And besides being tired and the cough keeping you up, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, my appetite ain’t what it used to be. Don't eat as much. And sometimes, just sometimes, I feel a little… short of breath. Not when I’m doing anything, just… when I’m sitting still. It doesn't last long, though. Mostly just a feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve noticed. Eleanor always took my temperature when I was sick. Now… I don’t bother. Chills… maybe a little sometimes, but it gets cold in the house, you know? Old house, doesn’t hold the heat well. Night sweats… no, not really. I just… sleep hot, I think. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes – in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a long time ago. I saw a doctor when I was younger, when I hurt my back working on cars. That was… a long time ago. Eleanor handled all the paperwork, you know? I just remember a lot of visits to the chiropractor, and some pills for the pain. I don’t think I had anything… serious. Nothing like heart or lungs. No diabetes, I don’t think. She always made sure I ate right.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. My appendix when I was a boy. And… yes, a small operation on my knee years later. Working on cars, you get bumps and bruises. The knee got bad, so they fixed it up. It didn’t last, though. But that was… a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, family history. Do you know of anyone in your family—parents, siblings—who had lung problems, heart disease, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she died when I was young. Pneumonia, I think. My father… he lived a long time. Worked on the farm his whole life. Strong man. I don’t remember him being sick much, just… old age eventually. I had a sister, but we didn’t see each other much. Don’t know much about her health. We lost touch. Eleanor's family… they were all pretty healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. Eleanor hated it. Always said it was a waste of money, and bad for your health. I listened to her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Could you please sit up straight and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Like this? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Your oxygen saturation is a bit low, 91%. And I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. And there's some dullness to percussion here. It could be fluid buildup.
PATIENT: Fluid… buildup? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? That doesn’t sound good. I… I don’t understand. Is it my lungs? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: It could indicate fluid in your lungs, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s not necessarily immediately alarming, but it warrants further investigation. We’ll need to get a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order one for you now. And I want you to get a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel as well. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Eleanor gave me some pills once for a cold, but I don't remember anything bad happening. I don't take much medicine, you know? Just… aspirin sometimes for a headache. But no… no allergies that I’m aware of. This X-ray… will it hurt, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s just a quick image. We’ll have the results back later today. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics, just in case this is a lung infection. And I’m going to recommend a follow-up appointment with a pulmonologist, a lung specialist, after we get the X-ray results. It's best to get an expert opinion.
PATIENT: A pulmonologist… that sounds serious. Is my lungs… really bad, Doctor? What kind of infection could it be? Eleanor always said I should have taken better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s far too early to say anything definitive. We need the X-ray results first. The antibiotics are a precaution. It could be something relatively minor, like bronchitis or pneumonia. But given your age and low oxygen saturation, we need to be thorough. I’m also going to order a flu and pneumonia vaccine. It’s never too late to protect yourself. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Flu and pneumonia vaccine… yes, Doctor. If that will help, then yes. Eleanor always said to get vaccinated. I understand… you want to be sure. Will… will I be able to go home today?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pavlovic, you can go home today. But you need to take the antibiotics as prescribed, and you must keep your follow-up appointment with the pulmonologist. We'll get you scheduled before you leave. I’m also going to send these results to a geriatric specialist. Given your age, it's important to have a comprehensive assessment. Do you have someone who can help you with your medications and appointments?
PATIENT: No… not anymore. Eleanor… she handled everything. I’m on my own now. I… I can manage, I suppose. I always did most of the driving. But I’ll probably forget things, you know? I’m not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we have social workers available who can assist you with medication reminders and appointment scheduling. I’ll have them come speak with you before you leave. It’s important to have support. Let me print out your prescriptions and the appointment information. I'm going to write a note to the pulmonologist detailing your symptoms and the low oxygen saturation. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… will this make me feel better, Doctor? I just want to be able to breathe easy again. It’s been a long time, you know? A very long time.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can to help you breathe easier, Mr. Pavlovic. The antibiotics and the specialist's evaluation should give us a better idea of what’s going on and how to proceed. Here are your prescriptions, appointment information, and the contact information for the social worker. Please schedule your appointments as soon as possible. I’ll see you again after your evaluation. .
