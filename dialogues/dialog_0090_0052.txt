DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor Kur. Well, it’s this… queasiness I’ve been havin’ o’ a mornings. It's been botherin’ me for a wee bit now, and I thought I best get it checked, seein’ as how me heart isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: "A wee bit," you say?
PATIENT: Aye, a wee bit. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It’s not constant, mind ye. Just first thing, before I’ve had a chance to get a bite o’ breakfast. And it’s not… violent, if ye ken what I mean. More like a rollin’ in me stomach, and a bit o’… well, the urge to be sick, but not always actually being sick. It's just…unsettlin’. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, morning nausea for about three to four weeks, not constant, and no vomiting… just the feeling like you might. You mentioned your heart isn't what it used to be. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right, Doctor. I was diagnosed with heart failure… oh, must be five years ago now? The doctor – Dr. MacIntyre, back in Aberdeen – said it was weakened, not pumpin’ as strong as it should. I take some tablets for it, helps keep it under control most o’ the time. I get a bit o’ shortness o’ breath if I overdo it, but generally I'm alright. It’s just… this mornin’ sickness feels different than the breathlessness. It's… lower down, if ye ken.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart failure, managed with medication… and you're experiencing nausea that feels distinct from your usual symptoms. Are you taking all your heart medications as prescribed?
PATIENT: Aye, I am, Doctor. Every mornin’ and every evenin’, like clockwork. I've got a wee pill organiser, keeps me right. I’m meticulous about it, I am. I remember when I didn’t take them on time… that was a lesson learned, let me tell ye. No, I haven't missed a dose in months, I’d wager. I've not changed any o' them recently either, it's the same lot I've been on for a good while now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the nausea and the heart failure, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, maybe. But I’m 63, Doctor, so it’s hard to tell what’s just age and what’s somethin’ else. My appetite’s been… off and on, a bit like the nausea, actually. Some days I'm ravenous, others I can barely manage a biscuit. No weight loss to speak of, though. I've been weighin' myself, just to be sure. No pain, no swelling in me legs… nothin’ like that. Oh, and I’ve been sleepin’ alright, thankfully. It's not all bad, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue, fluctuating appetite, but no weight loss or leg swelling. Good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh, now ye're askin’… aye, actually. I have been… a bit more regular than usual, if ye ken what I mean. A bit looser, too. Not… dreadful, mind ye, but not me normal. I’d say it started around the same time as the queasiness, come to think o’ it. It's a wee bit embarrassing to talk about, but I'm tryin’ to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. That's important information. Now, let's talk about your diet. Have you made any recent changes to what you're eating or drinking?
PATIENT: Aye, well, nothin’ drastic. I’ve been tryin’ to eat a bit more fruit, Doctor, what with the summer and all. And a wee bit less… fried things, me wife keeps tellin’ me off for. She’s always on at me about me health, bless her. No more alcohol than usual, which isn’t much, mind ye. Just a wee dram on a Saturday night, if there's a good film on. I haven’t started takin’ any new supplements or herbal remedies, either. Just the tablets Dr. MacIntyre gave me. I stick to me usual tea and toast, mostly. Not much changes around here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your heart failure?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think… when I was a lad, I had me appendix out. Must be… oh, 50 years ago now? And I broke me arm when I was playin’ football, but that was just a wee thing. Apart from that, nothin’ major. No serious illnesses, no operations… just the usual coughs and colds, like everyone gets. I’ve never had any problems with me stomach before this, nothin’ like it. I’m generally a pretty healthy man, for me age. I used to be very active, but the heart… well, it slows ye down a bit, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child. No other hospitalizations. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ at all. I've never had a reaction to anythin’. Dr. MacIntyre checked when he started me on the heart tablets, and I told him then, I'm clear as a bell. No food allergies, no hay fever, no nothin’. I can eat shellfish, peanuts, the whole lot. Me wife tries to poison me with prawns sometimes, just to see if I'm payin' attention! But I’m alright, I promise ye. Never had a rash, never had a swollen throat… nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Aye, well, me father had high blood pressure, and he died of a stroke when he was in his 70s. Me mother had arthritis, terrible pain she was in. And me sister’s got diabetes, type 2, she’s been on tablets for years. Apart from that, nothin' major. No heart problems on either side of the family, as far as I know. No cancer, no nothin' like that. Just the usual old age ailments, really. It’s the way of things, isn’t it? It's a long family tree, mind ye, but I can’t recall anythin’ standin’ out.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure and stroke in your father, arthritis in your mother, and type 2 diabetes in your sister. One last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched a cigarette in me life. Me wife wouldn't allow it, and frankly, I can't stand the smell. Always thought it was a foolish habit, and lookin' back at me father, coughin' his lungs out… no, thank ye very much. Always been a fresh air man, me. Used to spend a lot o' time walkin' in the hills, before the heart started playin’ up. So, no, never smoked, and never will. A wee dram is the worst I get.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m not afraid o’ a wee poke and prod. Just let me know if anythin' feels uncomfortable. I’m used to gettin’ checked over, what with the heart and all. I’m happy to do whatever ye need. Go ahead, then.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your heart now. It sounds… regular, but a bit faint. As expected with the heart failure. And now I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Aye, it's a wee bit tender, Doctor, right here on me left side. Not awful pain, mind ye, just… uncomfortable when ye press on it. It feels a bit… bloated, like I’ve eaten too much, but I haven’t. It's been like that for a few days now, come to think o' it. It's not constant, just comes and goes. But aye, it is a wee bit tender there, ye're right to ask. Does that mean somethin's wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. And now I'm listening to your abdomen. I'm hearing some… decreased bowel sounds, and a bit of… gurgling. And it does sound a bit… full. Not dramatically so, but noticeable. Alright, Mr. Benic. I’m going to have a look at your reflexes now. Just relax your legs for me.
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. I’m relaxin’ me legs. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin’. It's all a bit new to me, but I’m happy to cooperate. I’m just a bit worried now, if I’m honest. Is it somethin’ serious? The bloating and the tender tummy… it’s not like me at all. It's gettin' me a wee bit anxious, ye see.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal. Now, based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some degree of constipation and possible gastric retention. The decreased bowel sounds and bloating, combined with the tenderness in your left side, are consistent with that. Your history of heart failure, and the medications you take for it, can sometimes contribute to these types of issues. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's something we need to address. Have you been taking any over-the-counter medications for constipation, like laxatives?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense, Doctor. I knew somethin' was amiss. I haven't been takin' anythin' for it, no. I was hopin’ it would clear up on its own, but it hasn’t. I thought it was just a bit o’ indigestion, maybe. I was takin' some antacids for heartburn, but they didn't seem to help with the bloating. So, no laxatives, no nothin’ like that. I’m usually regular as clockwork, so I didn’t think much o’ it at first. But ye're right, it’s been botherin’ me now for a few weeks. What do ye think I should do?
DOCTOR: Okay. No laxatives. Given your history and the findings, I’m going to recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order some blood tests, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Second, I’m going to suggest you start a mild stool softener, like docusate sodium, twice a day. And third, and this is important, try to increase your fluid intake. Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. We’ll also want to monitor your weight closely. If you notice any significant weight gain, or if your symptoms worsen, please give the clinic a call right away. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests, stool softener, more water… I can manage that. Eight glasses of water… that’ll be a challenge, mind ye. I’m more o’ a tea man, but I’ll try me best. And I’ll keep an eye on me weight. What about me heart tablets? Should I change anythin’ about them? And is there anythin' special I should be lookin' out for? Anythin' that would mean I need to get seen right away, besides the weight gain? It's just… I worry a wee bit, ye see, with the heart and all. I don't want to end up back in hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic. No, don't change anything about your heart medications. Continue taking them exactly as prescribed. As for things to watch out for, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or if you notice any blood in your stool, please come to the emergency room immediately. Also, if you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or if your shortness of breath gets significantly worse, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. We’re going to start with these conservative measures – the stool softener, increased fluids, and blood tests – and see how you respond. I’ll review the results of the blood tests as soon as they come back, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s very helpful, Doctor. No, I think that covers it for now. Severe pain, vomitin', blood in me stool… and keep an eye on me shortness o' breath. And stick to the stool softener and the water. I can manage that. Thank ye for takin’ the time to listen to me, and for explainin’ everythin’ so clearly. It's put me mind at ease a bit. I’ll get those blood tests done right away, and I’ll let the clinic know if anythin’ changes. Thank ye again, Doctor Kur.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get those blood tests ordered for you right away. And remember, if anything changes, or if you're worried, please don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and take care. .
