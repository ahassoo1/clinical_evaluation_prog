DOCTOR: Hi Norval, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's… it's my stomach, mostly. I get full awfully quick these days. Even after just a little bit of food. It's been happening for a few months now, I'd say. Not sure what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. A few months of getting full quickly… I understand that can be really frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s just… like, I could be eating a sandwich, and halfway through I just… stop. Not because I want to, but because I feel like I couldn’t possibly eat another bite. And it’s not a sick feeling, exactly. Just… full. And it stays with me for a while, even if it wasn’t much food. My wife, she keeps saying I should eat slower, but I don't think that's it. I've always eaten at a normal pace.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, and it's good you've noticed it isn't related to how you eat. So, it's more about the amount of food, even a normal amount, causing you to feel full sooner than you used to. Does this happen with all foods, or are there specific things that seem to trigger it more?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it’s worse with heavier foods. Like, a big plate of stew? Forget about it. I’d be done after a few bites. But a salad? I can usually manage a bit more of that. Not a whole lot more, mind you, but a bit. And soup? Sometimes soup is okay, sometimes it's not. It's… it’s a little different every time, to be honest. Hard to pin down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavier foods seem to be more problematic, and it’s not entirely consistent. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the early fullness?
PATIENT: Not really, no. No pain, no nausea, nothing like that. Just… full. And sometimes a little bit of… I don’t know… tiredness afterwards? But I’m 88, Doctor, so I’m tired a lot of the time anyway! It’s hard to say if that’s related or just… being old.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good you're able to differentiate between what might be new symptoms and what's just part of getting older. No pain or nausea is good. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart years back, but they put a stent in and it's been alright ever since. Nothing else major, not that I can recall. Oh! And arthritis in my hands, but that's just a nuisance. Lots of people have that. I don’t take much medication for it, just some cream sometimes. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff, to be honest. She’s got a better memory than me these days.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. Appendix removal, a stent placed for heart trouble, and arthritis are good things to know. And it's great you have your wife helping you with your medical care. Do you happen to know what medications you’re currently taking, even for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… mostly just the cream for my hands. It’s… Diclofenac, I think? That’s right, Diclofenac. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bad, I’ll take a couple of paracetamol. Just when I need them, though. Not every day. I think that’s it. My wife keeps a list, of course, but I don’t bother with all that. She knows what I need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Diclofenac cream and occasional paracetamol. That's good to know. And you mentioned a stent – do you remember when that was placed, and are you on any medications specifically for your heart condition now?
PATIENT: Oh, the stent… that was… goodness, must be fifteen years ago now? Maybe more. Dr. Olsen put it in. A good doctor, he was. And let me think about the medication… I think I’m on something for my heart, but it’s just one little pill every day. A white one. I honestly can't remember the name of it, Doctor. My wife would know. She manages all the pills, sorts them out every week. I just take what she gives me. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to have a good memory…
DOCTOR: That's alright, Norval, it's very common to forget these things. We can certainly ask your wife when she’s here. Let’s move on to family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he died of a stroke, but he was a smoker, so that probably wasn't too surprising. And my sister… she had diabetes, but she lived a long life despite it. Beyond that… not that I can recall. We weren’t a family that talked about our ailments much. It was more about getting on with things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, stroke in your father , and diabetes in your sister. That’s good information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, Doctor. My father tried to get me to start when I was a young man, but I wouldn't have it. Always thought it was a foolish habit. My wife doesn't smoke either. Good habits, you see. Always been a believer in good habits.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I enjoy a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. A small glass. Nothing heavy. And my wife, she'll have one too. It's a little treat. But we don't drink every day. Maybe a few times a week. Nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are you experiencing any weight loss lately?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… I think I might have lost a little bit of weight, actually. Not much, but my clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. But I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, so I couldn’t say for sure. My wife would know. She’s always noticing things like that. Women always do, don’t they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do. Alright, Norval, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've had plenty of doctor exams in my 88 years. I'm used to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound mostly clear, but I'm noticing a slight decrease in breath sounds at the bottom of both lungs. It's not a major concern right now, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don't feel any lumps or tenderness. It feels a little full in your upper abdomen, which could be related to the early fullness you've been experiencing. Your reflexes are normal. Overall, your exam doesn't show anything alarming, but the fullness in your abdomen and slight decrease in breath sounds are things we should investigate further. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always checks when she gets a new prescription, just to be safe. She’s very careful like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright, Norval, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing early satiety – meaning you feel full quickly after eating. The mild fullness in your upper abdomen and slight decrease in breath sounds could be contributing to this. Given your age and the fact that this has been going on for a few months, I think it's important to rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any deficiencies. I also recommend a stool test to check for any hidden blood and rule out any digestive issues. And, just to be on the safe side, I think a chest X-ray would be helpful to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests, stool tests, X-ray… go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I'd rather be safe than sorry, especially at my age. It’s probably just old age, but it’s good to check, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Norval, it’s always best to check. Okay, I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests, stool test, and chest X-ray. The lab and radiology departments will contact you to schedule appointments. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals. Try to avoid large portions, especially of heavier foods. And make sure you're drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day. I also want to ask your wife if she's noticed any changes in your appetite or weight loss lately. She might have some additional insights. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Smaller meals, more fluids… I can manage that. And I’m sure my wife will be happy to tell you everything she's noticed. She notices everything. I’ll let her know what you said. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Norval. I'm glad I could help. Once you’ve scheduled the tests, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. You've been very thorough. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again once we have the test results. Have a good day. .
