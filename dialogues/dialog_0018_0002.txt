DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that’s me. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think… it’s… the water. Going to the bathroom, you know? It’s… hard. Not easy. It just doesn’t… go like it used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. You’re experiencing difficulty with urination – it’s become more challenging to empty your bladder completely. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. Emptying... that’s a good way to put it. It feels like… like there's always a little left in there, even after I go. And sometimes... sometimes it just starts and stops. Very strange. Not a smooth flow, you see? It's been happening for… well, I don’t know how long now. A while, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like you’re experiencing incomplete emptying and intermittent flow. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a “while” – could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… that’s hard for me. Everything feels like a long time these days. Hmm… maybe… since last winter? Or maybe the winter before that? I went to visit my daughter in Honolulu last year, and I think it was bothering me a bit even then. But it wasn’t too bad, so I didn’t say anything. It's just gotten… more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. So, approximately a year or so. And it’s been gradually worsening. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. More… a discomfort. Like a little pressure. And sometimes, right after I go, it feels a bit… empty down there. Not painful, just… strange. A little shaky feeling, you know? Not all the time, just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Discomfort and a shaky feeling after urination. And, to get a more complete picture, are you experiencing any increased frequency or urgency – do you find yourself needing to go to the bathroom more often, or with a sudden, strong urge?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes the urge comes very suddenly. Like I just have to go, right now. And I do go a little more often than I used to, I think. Not every hour or anything, but… more than I’d like. It interrupts my… my knitting, you see? I like to sit and knit, and then suddenly… I have to go! It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. It certainly sounds disruptive to your routine. Now, let’s move on to some other questions, just to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh… color and smell? Let me think… I haven’t really looked, if I’m honest. I just… go. I don’t pay much attention to it. Old age, you know. Things start to… slip your mind. I don’t think it smells different, but I couldn’t say for sure. My daughter always says I don’t notice things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s common not to pay close attention to those details. Now, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather. It’s always hot here. Chills… no, not really. And my back… oh, my back always aches a little. Old age again! But it’s not a new ache, you understand? It’s just… my back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure. My doctor gave it to me a long time ago. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my hands are really stiff. A little white pill. And… oh, I take vitamins. A multi-vitamin, every morning with my breakfast. That’s all I can think of right now. My daughter helps me keep track of them, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get a little rash when I was a child, from poison ivy, I think. But that was a long, long time ago. I haven't had any trouble with anything lately. My daughter always asks me that, and I always say no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and back, and then I’d like to do a quick neurological check. And finally, I’d like to do a simple urine test to check for infection or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a test? Well, I don’t mind a little poking and prodding. My daughter says I need to listen to the doctor, you know. So, yes, that’s alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have my knitting waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It won’t take long at all, Ms. Stoffregen. First, let's listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll gently listen with my stethoscope. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to listen to your back. Alright, that sounds clear as well. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes briefly. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, legs. Here you go. Be gentle now, my knees aren't what they used to be. My daughter says I don't move as quickly as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, and now the other leg. Okay, reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, I’m going to need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Could you please go to the restroom and collect a sample for me?
PATIENT: Oh, a sample. Right. The restroom. Yes, I can do that. Just tell me where it is, and I'll try not to make a mess. My daughter always says I'm a little clumsy these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The restroom is right over there. There's a cup in there, and I've left instructions on the counter. Please just collect a small sample – about two ounces – in the cup. Take your time, and if you have any trouble, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: Alright, two ounces. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll send this off to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results. While we wait for those results, based on your symptoms and the preliminary physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention and possible overactive bladder. This is common, especially with age. There are several things we can try to help manage this.
PATIENT: Oh… retention? Overactive? That sounds… complicated. What does that mean, exactly? And what can we do about it? I don’t want to have to worry about this all the time, you see. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally, and get back to my knitting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Stoffregen. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s complicated, just that your bladder isn’t functioning quite as efficiently as it once did. Urinary retention means you’re not completely emptying your bladder when you urinate. Overactive bladder means the bladder muscles contract involuntarily, causing a sudden urge to urinate, even when the bladder isn't full. We can start with some simple lifestyle changes. These include timed voiding – going to the bathroom on a regular schedule, even if you don't feel the urge – and bladder training, which involves gradually increasing the time between bathroom visits. We can also discuss pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises, to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder. Depending on the lab results, we may consider medication to help relax the bladder muscles or reduce the urge to urinate. But we'll start with the simplest options first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Timed voiding… bladder training… Kegel exercises… oh dear. That sounds like a lot to remember! I’m not very good with schedules, you see. And I don’t think I know how to do those… Kegel exercises. My daughter is good at those things, maybe she can help. But I’m worried about the medication. I don’t like taking pills if I don’t have to. What if they make me feel sick?
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot at first, Ms. Stoffregen, but we can take it one step at a time. We can start with just one or two things and see how you manage. And don’t worry, we’ll only consider medication if the other options aren’t providing enough relief. If we do decide to try medication, we’ll start with a very low dose and monitor you closely for any side effects. As for the Kegel exercises, they are quite simple. They involve squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. You can practice them anywhere, anytime. I can give you a handout with detailed instructions, and your daughter can certainly help guide you as well. Let's start with the handout and the timed voiding. Try to go to the bathroom every two to three hours, even if you don't feel the urge. And we'll follow up in a week to see how you're doing. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as fever, pain, or inability to urinate, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A handout… and timed voiding. Every two to three hours… I think I can try that. My daughter will be happy to help. She always tells me what to do. And I’ll remember about the fever and pain. Yes, that sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now, knowing there are things we can try.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Remember, we're a team, and we'll work through this together. I'll have the nurse give you the handout before you leave. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be sure to review the lab results as soon as they become available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just getting back to my knitting is the main thing. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best with your knitting, and please remember to prioritize your health. Have a wonderful day. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
