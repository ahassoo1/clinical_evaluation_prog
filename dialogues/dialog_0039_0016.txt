DOCTOR: Hello Nicky, welcome. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about my bruising, Doctor. It’s… frankly, it's getting ridiculous. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, to prevent clots, and I seem to be covered in purple. It wasn’t this bad before. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse, especially while on a blood thinner… yes, that is concerning. It’s good you brought it up. Let's try to figure out what's going on. First, can you tell me a little more about the bruising?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you want to know? It’s purple. It appears when I bump into things, which, admittedly, isn’t as much as it used to be… I’m getting older, you know. But even little knocks leave a mark that lasts far too long. And sometimes… sometimes I get them for no reason at all. It's just… unsettling. Are you a new doctor? I don’t recall seeing you before.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. I am relatively new to the clinic – I’ve been here about eleven months now. Before that, I was working… well, it’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I assure you, I’m a fully licensed physician. Let’s focus on the bruising. When you say “little knocks,” can you give me an example of something that usually causes a bruise now, versus what would have caused one before you started the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Well, before… before all this, I was a very active man. I played tennis, I worked in the garden, I didn’t exactly tiptoe around. A good whack with a branch, a fall on the court – that sort of thing would give me a bruise, sure. But it would fade in a week or so. Now? Now I just look at a piece of furniture and I think I’m going to get a mark. I swear. A small bump against the coffee table yesterday and now my shin looks like a roadmap. It's… embarrassing, frankly. I used to be a very presentable man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a significant change in bruising pattern and ease – that's very helpful to know. And it sounds like it’s impacting your quality of life, which is important. Now, just to get a full picture, can you tell me what you’re taking the blood thinner for?
PATIENT: Oh, it was after the… the stroke, Doctor. A minor one, thankfully. But the doctors said I needed something to prevent another one. Something about clots forming in my heart. Warfarin, I think it is? Or maybe Coumadin… I get all those names mixed up. My wife used to handle all the medication details. It’s… difficult now, without her. She always knew exactly what I needed and when. Anyway, yes, it's for my heart. They monitor the levels, of course, but it seems… ineffective.
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for stroke prevention… that’s good to know. It is important that we keep a close eye on those levels, and it sounds like it might be time to revisit that. Do you know when the last time your levels were checked?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. They send me to the lab every few months, and I get a piece of paper with numbers on it. I hand it to the nurse, and she says, “Everything looks good.” I haven’t really questioned it. I assumed… well, I assumed they knew what they were doing. It’s been… a while, I suppose. Maybe six months? Or was it eight? I really can’t say. It all blurs together.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can certainly look into getting those records. It’s important to have a clear picture of where your levels have been. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I've been a bit more tired lately. Just generally feeling… run down. And I seem to be getting nosebleeds more often. Nothing major, just a little trickle here and there. And… oh! I cut myself shaving the other day, and it bled for a surprisingly long time. Longer than it used to, definitely. I had to press on it for a good ten minutes to get it to stop. Is that… normal? I'm starting to worry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, those aren’t ideal, Nicky. Prolonged bleeding and increased nosebleeds with the fatigue… it’s good you’re telling me all of this. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll take a look at the bruising, check your heart and lungs, and see if I can identify any other areas of concern. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything. I just want to figure out what's going on. This is… unsettling. And frankly, I don't like feeling like I’m falling apart. I've always been a strong, independent man. Just… please be thorough, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicky. We’ll be as thorough as possible. I understand how unsettling this must be, and we'll work together to get to the bottom of it. First, let’s take a look at your bruising. Can you point out the areas that concern you the most?
PATIENT: Certainly. This one is the newest, from yesterday. It barely took a nudge against the coffee table. And this… These ones appeared for no reason at all. Just woke up with them. And there’s a little one on my back, which my caregiver noticed when she was helping me get dressed. It's… humiliating, frankly. I'm covered in purple like some sort of… fruit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting the extent of the bruising, and it does appear quite widespread. The bruising on your shin is significant for the minimal trauma reported. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. No swelling in your extremities. Now, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, aside from the stroke, I had a bit of trouble with my kidneys a few years back. It cleared up on its own, thankfully. And I have… high blood pressure, I suppose. It’s managed with medication. Lisinopril, I think it is? And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was no fun. And I have… arthritis, in my knees mostly. It flares up from time to time. That's about it, I think. Do you need a list? My caregiver keeps a very detailed record. It's… rather extensive, actually. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Knowing this background is important. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Lisinopril and Warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, I take something for my arthritis. Naproxen, I believe. And occasionally, when my knees are really bothering me, my caregiver gives me a stronger painkiller. Tramadol, I think it’s called. She’s very careful with the dosage, of course. And… I take a multivitamin every day. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I rely on her to manage most of it. She’s a godsend, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have Warfarin, Lisinopril, Naproxen, and Tramadol as needed. That’s a lot of medications that can interact with each other, and potentially affect your bleeding. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. It's going to check your INR – that's how we measure how well the Warfarin is working. We'll also check your complete blood count to see if you have any signs of anemia, and kidney function to assess your kidney health. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Not to any medications, anyway. I'm a bit sensitive to bee stings, but that's about it. Just a little swelling, nothing serious. And… oh! I used to be allergic to penicillin, but I haven’t had that in years. I think I’ve outgrown it. Or maybe it was just a rash. I can’t really remember. It was a long time ago. But no, nothing significant. Just the bee stings.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, bee sting sensitivity, and a past history of a possible penicillin allergy. We'll note that you may have outgrown the penicillin allergy. Okay, Nicky, based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam, I'm concerned about the increased bruising, fatigue, nosebleeds, and prolonged bleeding, especially given that you’re on Warfarin and taking multiple medications. It's important to rule out any underlying causes. I'm going to order those blood tests, and I want to get an updated medication list from your caregiver. We need to review all your medications to make sure there are no interactions causing these issues. We also need to consider the possibility of anemia, kidney problems, or other underlying medical conditions. For now, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury. And if you experience any significant bleeding, such as blood in your stool or urine, or prolonged bleeding from any cut, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. It's… reassuring to know you're taking this seriously. I just want to feel like myself again. I've always been an active man, and I miss being able to do things without worrying about bruising or bleeding. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. Some doctors… well, they don't always take older patients seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nicky. It's my job to listen, and to take your concerns seriously. And you absolutely deserve to feel like yourself again. We'll work together to figure out what's going on, and get you back to doing the things you enjoy. I'll have the lab order sent over right away, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if anything changes, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you need a ride home?
PATIENT: No, thank you. My caregiver is picking me up. She's very reliable. I appreciate the offer, though. I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you again. I feel… a little better, just knowing that someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicky. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
