DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Billman. It is nice to meet you. I… I have been having trouble breathing. A whistling sound, when I try to take a deep breath. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble breathing… and a whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a whistling. Like… like a tea kettle, almost. It happens mostly when I walk, or if I try to do something… energetic. Not so much when I am resting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A tea kettle, alright. It sounds like it makes sense. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? Not very bad at first. Just a little puffing. But it has gotten worse the last week, I think. Especially with this heat. It is very warm, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s been unseasonably warm. A month, gradually worsening… and worse with exertion, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Walking is the worst. Even going up the stairs. I used to be very active, you know. I work with the young athletes. I help them stretch, make sure they don’t hurt themselves. But now… I have to stop and rest often. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other symptoms along with the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. And I cough a little, mostly at night. A dry cough, not much phlegm. I don’t have a fever, I don’t think. I feel… tired, more tired than usual. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Tightness, cough, fatigue… yes, those can all be related. Do you notice any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh! Now that you mention it… yes, a little. Mostly in the evenings. I thought it was just from being on my feet all day, at work. But maybe it is something else? I am not sure. I have never had this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll need to do a quick exam to get a better idea of what's going on. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and take a look at those ankles you mentioned. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to feel better, and I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight and take some deep breaths when I ask you to… Let’s start with your lungs. Deep breath in… and out. Again… and out. Hmm. And one more. Now, take a normal breath…
PATIENT: Is something wrong, Doctor? It feels… a little wheezy, doesn't it? I can feel it myself now, even when I am just sitting here.
DOCTOR: There is some wheezing, yes. And a slight decrease in airflow. Okay, let’s check your heart rate. Normal, a little elevated, but not alarming. Blood pressure is also within the normal range. Now, let’s take a look at those ankles. Yes, some mild swelling present. Alright. Now, can you tell me about any medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And I had a little problem with my blood pressure, but it has been controlled with medication for a long time now. I also used to have asthma when I was a child, but I haven’t had any problems with it since I was very young. Not since I moved from Bhutan, actually. Does that matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Asthma as a child… that does matter. It suggests a predisposition. Do you remember what medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was a long time ago. I think… Lisinopril? Or something that sounded like that. I have been taking the same pill for years, it is a small white one. My doctor before, he always just sent the refills. I don't like to bother him with small things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to confirm that medication. And it’s always best to be thorough, even with “small things,” Mrs. Kilton. It’s easy to miss things if we don’t ask. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I have a strong stomach, I think! My family… we eat a lot of spicy food, you know. It builds up your tolerance. No allergies, Doctor. I am pretty healthy, usually. It's just this breathing… it worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing an exacerbation of asthma, possibly triggered by the heat or an environmental irritant. It's possible your previous asthma has re-activated, and the wheezing confirms some airway obstruction. However, we'll need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray… and a pulmonary… what did you call it? I’m sorry, Doctor. My ears aren't what they used to be, and all these words… It sounds serious. Is it something bad? I just want to breathe normally again. I am not very good with medical things, I am afraid. Can you explain it to me in… simpler words?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. A chest X-ray is just a picture of your lungs. It helps us see if there's anything blocking your airways, like fluid or inflammation. The pulmonary function test… that’s a breathing test. You’ll breathe into a tube and it measures how much air you can get in and out of your lungs. It tells us how well your lungs are working. It’s not necessarily something bad. It's just a way to be certain about what is causing your breathing problems. It's most likely asthma, but we need to be sure before we start any treatment. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: A picture… and a breathing test. That sounds… less scary than I thought. Yes, I understand. If it helps you find out what is wrong, then I am happy to do it. I trust you, Doctor. When can I have these tests? Will they be… painful?
DOCTOR: No, neither test is painful. The X-ray is just a quick exposure to radiation – a very low dose. The breathing test is just… breathing. The nurse will schedule those for you before you leave. She'll also give you a prescription for an inhaler in the meantime – it will help open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a standard treatment for asthma, and it should provide some relief. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: An inhaler… that sounds good. Something to help me breathe right now. Will the inhaler… make me feel different? Like… dizzy or anything? I don’t want to be unable to work with the athletes. They depend on me. And thank you, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, it’s a rescue inhaler. It’s meant to relieve symptoms, not cause them. Some people experience a slight tremor or increased heart rate, but it's rare, and usually mild. It's extremely unlikely to affect your ability to work. You’ll start with a low dose. If you experience any significant side effects, stop using it and contact the clinic. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Low dose. Stop if I feel bad. I understand. A rescue inhaler… that’s good. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I feel much better now, knowing what is happening. When will I get the results of the tests? And will you tell me what to do after that?
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. The nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. At that appointment, we’ll review the results and determine the best course of treatment, whether it’s a long-term maintenance inhaler, pulmonary rehabilitation, or something else. Now, do you have any further questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I am grateful for your time and your patience with me. Thank you again. I will wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try to avoid strenuous activity until we determine the cause of your breathing problems. And if your symptoms worsen, go to the nearest emergency room. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
