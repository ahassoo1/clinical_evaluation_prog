DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even though I am being treated for sleep apnea. I use a machine every night, you see – a CPAP, I think it’s called – and for a long time it was working wonderfully. But lately... I just feel tired all the time. It's making things difficult, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Daytime sleepiness despite CPAP treatment for sleep apnea. That’s definitely something we need to investigate. It's good you're already being treated – that's a great first step. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, but I just don’t have the energy I used to. Even after a full night’s sleep – or what should be a full night's sleep – I wake up feeling… not refreshed, exactly. Just… blah. And it gets worse as the day goes on. I used to enjoy gardening, reading… even just visiting with friends. Now, I find myself napping in the afternoon, which I never used to do. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. And my wife… well, she worries, naturally. She’s the one who reminded me to make this appointment, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's not overwhelming sleepiness, but a lack of restorative sleep and increasing fatigue throughout the day, despite consistent CPAP use. And it’s affecting your daily activities and causing concern for your wife. That's all very helpful information. Let's talk about the CPAP a little more. How often do you use it?
PATIENT: Oh, every night. Almost. There was one night a few weeks ago when the power went out during a storm, but other than that, religiously. I make sure it’s clean, the mask fits properly… I try to do everything right. It’s just… it doesn’t feel like it’s working as well as it used to. I’ve even tried adjusting the settings a little myself, but I don’t really know what I’m doing, to be perfectly honest. It’s a bit of a trial-and-error process. Do you need to know the exact pressure setting? I think it’s around 10… but I could be wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent CPAP use is good, and you’re taking good care of the equipment. It's understandable that you're trying to adjust it yourself, but it’s best to have that done by a professional. We’ll get that checked. The pressure setting of around 10 is good to know, we can confirm that in your records. Now, aside from the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my wife says I snore a bit, even with the machine on. Not like I used to before the CPAP, of course, but she’s noticed it’s come back a little. And… now that you mention it, I have been waking up with a bit of a dry mouth most mornings. Not terrible, but noticeable. Oh! And I think I’ve been a little more… forgetful lately, although at my age, that could just be… well, you know. But it does seem a bit worse than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we’ve got some snoring despite CPAP use, dry mouth in the mornings, and increased forgetfulness. That's all useful information. The snoring is particularly important, as it suggests the CPAP might not be fully controlling your airway obstruction. Let's move on to a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, which is managed with medication. I take a small dose every day. And I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I seem to be fully recovered from that. Other than that… I’m reasonably healthy for my age, I think. I try to eat a balanced diet, although I do enjoy a good Spanish meal now and then. And I used to walk a lot, but like I said, the tiredness has made that more difficult. I think that's about it. Oh! And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but that’s just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, a history of pneumonia, and some knee issues. That gives me a good baseline. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I take a little something for my knees, an over-the-counter pain reliever, when they’re particularly bothering me. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But not every day, just when I need it. And I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. My daughter always tells me I should, so I do. But other than that, no. Nothing else. I don’t really believe in all those fancy supplements, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. Now, before we move onto a physical examination, could you tell me a little about any allergies you might have?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I don't think I'm allergic to any foods. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I shave, but that's about it. Oh! And I used to be allergic to bee stings, as a child, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in decades. I don’t think I’m still allergic, but it’s probably best to mention it. I don’t go around poking bees, naturally. I haven’t had a reaction in so long, I honestly can’t remember what it felt like.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known major allergies, mild skin irritation after shaving, and a childhood history of bee sting allergy, but no recent reactions. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or sleep problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart disease, unfortunately. He had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my mother had diabetes, later in life. My brother also has high blood pressure, like me. As for sleep problems… my wife's father snored terribly, but I don’t know if he ever had it checked. I don’t know of anyone else in the family who had sleep apnea, specifically. It’s not something we talked about much, to be honest. It’s not a very glamorous topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Knowing about the heart disease is particularly important. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m divorced, been that way for quite a while now. I live alone, but my daughter and grandchildren live nearby, so I see them often. I used to work as a professor, teaching history and cultural studies. Now, I’m retired, enjoying a more relaxed pace of life, when the tiredness allows it. I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I don’t drink heavily. And I don’t do any recreational drugs. I’m a fairly quiet person, enjoy reading and gardening, spending time with my family. That’s about it, really. A simple life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Divorced, retired professor, close family ties, no smoking or drug use, and occasional light alcohol consumption. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Paske. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health and situation. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and nose. It shouldn't take too long. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I want to figure out what's going on, and get my energy back.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat and nose. Open your mouth for me, please. Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Now, let me just take a look at your nose… Nasal passages are clear as well. There is some mild swelling in the soft palate. That could be contributing to some airway resistance. Alright, that completes the physical examination for now. Everything seems relatively normal, but the mild swelling in your palate is something to note. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, I suspect a few possibilities. It could be that your CPAP machine isn't properly optimized, or that there's some underlying nasal congestion contributing to your symptoms. The swelling in your palate could also be a factor. It's also important to rule out other potential causes of fatigue, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, please go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, as you said. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and examine me so thoroughly. I'm ready to do whatever it takes to feel better again. What kind of tests are you thinking about?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infections or anemia. A thyroid panel to rule out thyroid problems, as I mentioned. And a vitamin D level, as deficiency can cause fatigue. I also recommend a sleep study, to re-evaluate your CPAP settings and see how effectively it’s controlling your airway obstruction. It’s possible the pressure settings need adjusting, or that you might benefit from a different type of mask. Finally, I'd like to refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – to evaluate the swelling in your palate and rule out any structural issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. Does that all sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough and reasonable, Doctor. A complete blood count, thyroid panel, vitamin D level, another sleep study… and seeing the ENT specialist. All of it. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. I’ll make arrangements to get the blood work done right away, and I’ll schedule the sleep study and ENT appointment as soon as possible. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of before I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send the lab orders to your local lab electronically, so just let them know your name and date of birth. As for the sleep study, the clinic will reach out to schedule that for you. Regarding the ENT appointment, I’ll write a referral and send it to your primary care physician, who will coordinate the scheduling. In the meantime, please continue to use your CPAP machine as prescribed. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as difficulty breathing or chest pain. I’ll review the results of your tests as soon as they come in and contact you to discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything very well, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I really appreciate your help. I’ll get the blood work done right away and wait to hear from the clinic about the sleep study and the ENT appointment. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if any concerns arise. I wish you the best, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the test results. Have a good day!
