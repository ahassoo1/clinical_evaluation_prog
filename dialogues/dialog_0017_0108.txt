DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Blim. I see here you're 51 years of age. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… bleeding. From down there. Let’s just say it’s not a little nosebleed, alright? It’s… substantial. Been happenin’ for a few days now. Not fun, I’ll tell ya that much.
DOCTOR: Substantial, you say. Very well. Let's try to be a bit more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise? Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? I just know it’s a lot. It’s… dark. And it's… well, it comes out when I, you know, go. And sometimes even when I don't. Is that precise enough for ya? Honestly, I’m not sure what more detail you want. It's blood, coming from where it shouldn’t, and it’s a pain in the backside, if you'll excuse my French.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. 'Where it shouldn’t' is not a particularly helpful diagnostic descriptor, Mr. Gentz. We need to establish a timeline. When exactly did this begin?
PATIENT: Alright, alright, don't get your stethoscope in a twist. Let me think… It started, oh, maybe… four days ago? Thursday, I reckon. I was feelin' a little off, kinda weak, but I figured it was just somethin’ I ate. Then, uh… Friday mornin', that's when I noticed it. Just a little at first, thought maybe it was somethin’ with the… the toilet paper, you know? But it got worse from there. Every time I went to the bathroom, it was more and more. That’s when I knew somethin’ was wrong. Four days, Doctor. Four days of this mess.
DOCTOR: And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms are we talkin’ about? Look, I've been tired. More tired than usual, anyway. And kinda lightheaded, feel like I’m gonna fall over when I stand up too fast. And… honestly, I haven’t had much of an appetite. Everything just tastes… off. Like metal, maybe? I dunno. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Because if you're askin’ if I've been feelin' rainbows and sunshine, the answer's a definite no. This whole thing is miserable.
DOCTOR: Metal taste is… interesting. Alright. Have you experienced any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Yeah, some. Not like a sharp, stabbin’ kind of pain. More of a… dull ache, down there. And sometimes, when I, uh, go, it’s like… pressure. A lot of pressure. And it makes me sweat. Not a little sweat, mind you, a lot of sweat. I'm not a delicate flower, but this ain't pleasant, let me tell ya. Makes me feel weak just thinkin’ about it. And honestly, Doc, I'm startin' to get worried.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will need to conduct a physical examination. I trust you understand this is necessary to determine the cause of your… discomfort. I'll need you to disrobe from the waist down, and I'll be right back with the appropriate equipment. Please use the gown provided. And try to relax, Mr. Gentz. Though, frankly, I suspect this won't be a particularly enjoyable experience for either of us.
PATIENT: Disrobe? You want me to… Look, I ain’t exactly thrilled about this, Doc. But fine. If you gotta poke and prod, you gotta poke and prod, I guess. Though I’m tellin’ ya, I’m not one for bein’ fiddled with. And "relax"? Easier said than done when you’re worryin’ about… all this. Just… hurry up, alright? And try not to look so… judgmental. It's makin' this worse. grumbles as he takes the gown
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. If you'll lie on the examination table, facing upwards. I will be performing a digital rectal exam, followed by a proctoscopy. This will allow me to visualize the rectum and identify any potential sources of bleeding. Please inform me if you experience any significant discomfort. Now, take a deep breath… and relax. Yes, relax. I note some tenderness upon palpation... and I do observe evidence of significant hemorrhoidal swelling. There is also… a small amount of fresh blood present. Hmm. Alright. That's enough for now. Please get dressed. We’ll discuss the findings.
PATIENT: Relax? You keep sayin' that. Easier said than done with somethin' shoved… Never mind. Alright. So? What'd you see? Is it somethin' serious? And don't give me the "relax" speech again. Just tell me straight. Hemorrhoids? Is that all it is? Because honestly, I've heard bad things about those things. And if it’s somethin’ worse… I don't want to be sugarcoated. Lay it on me, Doc. I can take it.
DOCTOR: The examination reveals evidence of significant internal hemorrhoids, consistent with your symptoms. The bleeding appears to be originating from these hemorrhoids. However, given the amount of bleeding you reported, and the fact that it has persisted for four days, I am not entirely satisfied. While the hemorrhoids are likely the primary cause, we cannot rule out the possibility of other underlying issues. To be certain, I recommend a complete blood count to assess for anemia, and a stool occult blood test to determine if there is bleeding higher up in the gastrointestinal tract. Frankly, Mr. Gentz, the fact that you waited four days to seek medical attention is… concerning. Early intervention is always preferable. I will order the necessary tests. Do you have any insurance to cover these costs?
PATIENT: Insurance? You’re askin’ me about insurance now? Look, Doc, I told you from the start, I ain’t got any. My wife… she had the insurance. But she’s gone now. And I’m… well, I’m makin’ do. So, you’re tellin’ me it could be somethin’ worse? That’s what you’re sayin’? What kinda worse? Cancer? ‘Cause if you’re gonna tell me that, you better just spit it out. Don't beat around the bush. And how much is all this gonna cost me? I ain’t made of money, you know. This is already stressin' me out enough. Honestly, sometimes I wish I'd just stayed home and suffered. At least then I wouldn't have to deal with… this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your financial concerns, but allowing your anxieties to dictate medical decision-making is… unwise. While I cannot definitively rule out more serious conditions without further testing, it is equally plausible that this is a relatively straightforward case of severe hemorrhoids. The complete blood count and stool occult blood test will cost approximately $250. The laboratory is located two blocks from here. As for “cancer,” it is premature and irresponsible to jump to such conclusions. However, if the bleeding persists or worsens despite conservative management, further investigation—including a colonoscopy—may be warranted. A colonoscopy, I might add, is significantly more expensive. For now, I recommend an over-the-counter stool softener and topical hemorrhoid cream. Avoid straining during bowel movements, and increase your fiber intake. I will also write you a referral to a gastroenterologist, should the need arise. Do you have any questions regarding these instructions?
PATIENT: $250… That’s… that’s a lot. Fiber… stool softener… cream… It's always somethin', isn't it? My wife used to handle all this. I didn’t even know what a stool softener was until five minutes ago. A colonoscopy… you're talkin' about lookin' up there? No thank you. I can barely afford the $250, let alone… whatever that costs. And honestly, Doc, I don’t want to know. I just want this bleedin’ to stop. That's all. So, cream and stool softener, huh? And see a fancy stomach doctor if it doesn’t get better. Alright. Fine. Just… write it down, Doc. I need somethin' to show for this whole ordeal. And please, no more talk about colonoscopies. It’s makin’ me sick just thinkin’ about it. .
DOCTOR: Here are your instructions and referral. The laboratory and gastroenterologist's office are both located at 14th and Elm Street. I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with the gastroenterologist within two weeks if your symptoms do not improve. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Gentz?
