DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's...fine to meet you, I suppose. It's a bit silly, really. I just...well, my daughter said I should come get a card. A “get well” card, or an “encouragement” card, she said. Seems a bit much, doesn't it? I’m perfectly alright, you know. Just a little…low spirits, maybe. But a card from a doctor…that should quiet her.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's thoughtful of your daughter to be concerned, and it's perfectly alright to come in and discuss how you're feeling, even if it's not a traditional illness. Sometimes low spirits can be a sign something else is going on, and we want to rule those things out. It’s good you’re here. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "low spirits"?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s just…things aren’t right. Everything feels…grey. Not sad, exactly. Just…flat. Like a soda that’s been sitting open too long. No fizz. My husband, he doesn’t understand. He says I’m always worrying about something, and that I should just be grateful for what we have. And I am grateful! We have a good life, a nice home. But…I don’t know. I just don’t have the energy for things anymore. It’s exhausting, even getting out of bed. Does that make any sense? I feel like I’m explaining it terribly.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Micucci. You’re describing a loss of interest and energy, and that feeling of things being “flat” – it’s a very common way to describe how things feel when someone is experiencing a change in their mood or well-being. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is important to address. Now, has this feeling come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been gradual, definitely. Not like a switch flipped, you know? More like…the color slowly draining out of a painting. It started…hmm…maybe six months ago? I don't know exactly. I used to love my garden. Spent hours out there, weeding, planting, making things look nice. Now…I look at it and just…don’t feel like it. It just feels like…work. And then I started not wanting to cook as much, even though I used to enjoy that too. Small things, really. But they add up, don’t they? My daughter keeps saying I need to “snap out of it”, but it’s not that easy.
DOCTOR: No, it’s absolutely not that easy, Ms. Micucci. It sounds like these changes have been building up over time, and it’s completely understandable that you’re feeling this way. It’s good you’re recognizing these shifts. Six months is a significant amount of time. Have you noticed any other changes along with the loss of interest in your hobbies?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. I’ve been sleeping more, I suppose. Not trouble sleeping, just…more of it. And I’ve been…forgetful. Not like forgetting where I put my keys, but…names. Faces. Little things. My daughter pointed that out too. She worries, that one. And…I haven’t been eating as much. Not on purpose, you understand. Just…not hungry. Food doesn’t taste as good anymore, either. Everything’s…bland. I’m probably just getting old. That’s what my husband says. “You’re not a spring chicken anymore”, he says. Very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me. These changes – the increased sleep, forgetfulness, and loss of appetite and taste – are all important pieces of the puzzle. While it’s true that changes can happen with age, it’s important to explore all possibilities. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… Nothing major, Doctor. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. Just a little stiff in the mornings. And…high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I take a little pill every day. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I’ve always been a healthy woman, all things considered. Never smoked, never drank much, always ate my vegetables…well, used to eat my vegetables. Still, I’ve always been careful. It's probably just…a phase. A woman thing, maybe?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Micucci. So, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, arthritis, and well-controlled high blood pressure. And you’ve never smoked or drank heavily, and generally eat a healthy diet. And just to clarify, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill, Doctor. A little orange one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Well, used to have breakfast. Now I just…have a cup of tea. Sometimes. My daughter keeps leaving those protein bars on the counter for me, but I don’t really have an appetite. She means well, but… honestly, it’s exhausting just thinking about it. All this fuss. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I’m not asking for much. Just a bit of energy, a bit of interest in things. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Micucci, that’s absolutely not too much to ask. And I understand how frustrating it must be to feel this way, and how exhausting it can be to even think about things that used to be enjoyable. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies... hmm. Nothing major, Doctor. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but I avoid cats. And I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, a long time ago. A rash, mostly. Nothing serious. Other than that, no. I've always been lucky that way. My daughter is the one with all the allergies. Pollen, dust, certain foods… it’s a long list. She's always sneezing and sniffing. I suppose I got the good genes in that department. Does that help? I just want to be clear, Doctor. I don't want to waste your time. This is all probably just…old age catching up. A bit of a slump, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Micucci. No known medication allergies besides a past reaction to penicillin, and a mild sensitivity to cats. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history... hmm. That's a difficult one. My mother… she was always a bit of a worrier, I suppose. Very anxious. She used to get terribly upset over small things. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she was in a hospital for a while when she was younger. Something about her nerves, my father said. But they didn't talk about things like that much back then. It was all very hush-hush. No one really talked about feelings. They just told you to pull yourself together. It wasn't like today. My daughter is always talking about therapy and mindfulness… it's all very new to me. I just try to stay positive, you know? But it's getting harder these days. Does that make sense? I’m probably rambling. I do that when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Micucci, you’re not rambling at all. It’s very helpful to know this information. It sounds like there may be a family history of anxiety, which is important to consider. And it's perfectly alright to feel nervous, especially when discussing personal things. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social situation. Are you currently working, or retired?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m retired now, Doctor. Been retired for…oh, must be ten years now. Used to work in a factory, assembling things. Small parts, mostly. It wasn’t glamorous, but it kept me busy. My husband is retired too. He used to be a teacher. Now we just…putter around the house. He likes to watch television, and I used to like gardening. But like I said, I haven’t been feeling up to it lately. We have a few friends, but we don’t see them as much anymore. It’s just…harder to get out and about. I miss having a routine, I suppose. And I miss feeling useful, you know? It's silly, really. A bit of a lost feeling, that’s all. But I shouldn’t be burdening you with all this. You have patients with real problems. I just wanted a card, remember? A little encouragement. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, please don’t feel like you’re burdening me. Your feelings are valid, and it’s important to me to understand what’s going on with you. It's not silly at all to want to feel better, and it sounds like you’re experiencing a significant change in your well-being. Now, before we move on, just one more question about your lifestyle. Do you regularly drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. Never. Not even a glass of wine. My husband doesn’t drink much either, maybe a beer with dinner on special occasions. And as for…recreational drugs… well, that’s just not our style. We always believed in a good, honest life. Hard work, healthy living, that’s what we always stood for. My daughter… well, she’s a bit more adventurous, but she’s always very responsible about it. But no, I haven’t touched anything like that in my life. I just wanted a card, Doctor. To quiet my daughter. To prove I’m alright. But…maybe I’m not, am I? I just…feel so tired. So…flat. Is that something a card can fix?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, it sounds like you've lived a very full and conscientious life, and it’s understandable that you're feeling this way. And no, a card won't fix this, and it's alright to admit that you're not feeling alright. Based on everything you've told me – the gradual loss of interest in your hobbies, the changes in your sleep and appetite, the forgetfulness, and the overall feeling of flatness – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other possible causes, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies, which can sometimes present with similar symptoms. I would like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests…hmm. Well… alright, I suppose so. If it will quiet my daughter, and if it will prove whether it’s just…old age, then yes. But I don’t like needles, Doctor. Never have. And I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. Just…the necessary things, alright? And…will it hurt? I just want to get this over with. I just want to feel normal again. To have the energy to do things, to enjoy my garden. To…not feel so flat. But blood tests… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle. And can I bring my husband with me? He’s good at holding my hand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Micucci. We'll only take the necessary blood samples, and I assure you, our phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. We can also do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. And yes, absolutely, please bring your husband with you. Having someone you trust there for support is always a good idea. The blood tests will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and some other basic indicators. It should take about ten minutes, and we'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a brief questionnaire to fill out – it’s a standard depression screening tool. This will help us further assess your symptoms and determine the best course of action. And depending on the results of the tests and the questionnaire, we can discuss potential treatment options, such as therapy or medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Therapy…medication…Oh dear. That sounds rather…serious, doesn’t it? I just wanted a card, Doctor. A little bit of encouragement. Now we’re talking about therapy and medication… I don’t know… I’ve always prided myself on being a strong woman, on dealing with things on my own. I don’t want to become dependent on pills, or have to talk about my feelings with a stranger. But…if it will quiet my daughter, and if it will prove that it’s just something physical, then… alright. I’ll fill out the questionnaire. And I’ll take the blood tests. But I’m still hoping it’s just…old age. Or a bit of a slump. Is that too much to ask? A bit of understanding? A bit of normalcy? Oh, dear. This is all rather overwhelming. Perhaps I should have just asked for the card.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel overwhelmed, Ms. Micucci. And it’s perfectly okay to be hesitant about therapy and medication. We’re not rushing into anything, and we’ll discuss all of your options before making any decisions. The questionnaire is just a tool to help us understand what’s going on, and the blood tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s about gathering information, not about forcing you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. And it’s absolutely not too much to ask for understanding and normalcy. That’s what we’re here for. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to find a solution that’s right for you. Here is the questionnaire. Take your time, and feel free to ask me any questions you have along the way. And remember, you’re not alone in this. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No…no, I think that’s alright, Doctor. Just…the questionnaire, and the blood tests. And maybe a bit of patience. I’m not very good at filling out forms. My handwriting isn’t what it used to be, either. But I’ll try. And thank you… for listening. And for not judging. My daughter…she means well, but she doesn’t understand. She thinks a card will fix everything. But…well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Just…one last question, Doctor. If…if it is something serious…will I have to tell my friends? I don’t want them to worry. They’re all elderly, you know. The last thing they need is to be concerned about me.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Ms. Micucci. And absolutely not, you are not obligated to tell your friends anything you don't want to. Your health is a personal matter, and you have the right to privacy. Whether you choose to share your diagnosis with them is entirely up to you. If you feel comfortable doing so, it can be helpful to have their support, but it’s perfectly alright to keep it to yourself. We can also discuss strategies for managing your condition without having to disclose anything to your friends, if that’s what you prefer. For now, let’s focus on completing the questionnaire and getting the blood tests done. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll work together to find a solution that’s right for you. Take your time, Ms. Micucci. I’m here if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I…I think I’m ready to start.
DOCTOR: .
