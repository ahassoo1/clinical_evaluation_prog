DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. Really, really bad. It’s not like a new thing, you know? I… I have the cancer, and it’s… well, it’s in my back now, I think. That’s what the other doctor said. It hurts all the time, but some days it’s worse. It makes it hard to even… stand up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like you’re experiencing quite a bit of pain, and it’s understandably concerning, especially with your existing health concerns. Thank you for sharing that with me. Just to clarify, when you say “the other doctor,” could you tell me who you saw and when?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was Doctor Ito. She’s at the big hospital, over in Pohnpei. I saw her… oh, about two months ago, I think? Maybe a little more. She did a scan, and she told me the cancer… it had spread. She said it was in my bones, and she thought mostly in my back. But I… I haven’t seen her since then. I came back home, and it just… got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Let me see if I can pull up the reports from Doctor Ito. While I'm doing that, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not just one kind of hurt. Sometimes it’s like… a sharp pain, right down my back, like something is poking me. And sometimes it’s just… a dull ache, all over. And it’s worse when I move. Like, when I try to bend over, or even just… twist. It makes me feel… stuck, you know? And it doesn’t really go away, even when I’m sitting. It’s just… always there. A little bit, or a lot. Sometimes it goes into my hips too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like you’re experiencing a complex type of pain – sharp, aching, and radiating. And it’s impacting your ability to move comfortably. Thank you for being so descriptive. To get a better understanding of the overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well… I found out about the cancer… almost a year ago. It was in my breast, at first. They did surgery, and… and radiation. But then… it came back. That’s when it spread. Like I said, Doctor Ito found it in my bones. Before that… I was pretty healthy, I think. Just… normal aches and pains, like anyone. I had the usual childhood sicknesses, but nothing serious. I don’t really… go to the doctor much, unless I have to. Does that help? I… I’m not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Meigs, thank you. It sounds like you've been through quite a lot with the breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and now dealing with the spread to your bones. Do you currently have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctors always checked when I was going for the cancer stuff, and they never said anything. I don’t take any medicines regularly, except for… sometimes, for the pain. But just when it’s really bad. Doctor Ito gave me something, but it doesn’t always work, and I ran out a while ago. I haven't gotten more because… well, money is tight, you know? And I didn't want to bother the doctor if it wasn’t helping much anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Meigs. It's good to know you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions. And it’s responsible of you to be mindful of costs. We can certainly discuss options for managing your pain that are affordable. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. They gave me lots of different medicines when I was getting the cancer treatment, and I was okay with all of them. I… I don’t really remember the names of them. But I never had any trouble with allergies, not to medicines or anything else. I eat all kinds of food, too. No problems there. I… I don't think I'm allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Meigs. No known allergies is helpful. Now, if you don’t mind me asking, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mother, she had… heart trouble. She died when I was pretty young, maybe ten years old. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He lived a long life, though. Lots of my aunts and uncles… they just died of old age, mostly. Nobody really talked much about sickness. We didn’t… go to the doctor much when I was growing up. It was just… not something we did. I… I don’t know if any of them had cancer. I don’t really remember. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Meigs. It’s understandable that you might not remember detailed family history information. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your father’s high blood pressure is helpful, and it's good to know about the other family members. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… well, I live alone. I used to work, but I had to stop when the cancer got bad. I mostly stay home now. I don't do much… exercise, I guess. It's hard to move with the pain. I mostly just watch TV, and… and try to take it easy. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink much. Maybe a little wine sometimes, with dinner. I… I eat okay, I think. Mostly local food. Fish, and… and fruits and vegetables. It's just… hard to do much these days. Everything is just… harder. Does that make sense? I don’t really go out much anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. It sounds like you're facing a lot of challenges, and it's understandable that your lifestyle has changed. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I… I don’t mind. Just… be gentle, please? It really hurts when you push on my back. I… I’ll try to tell you if it’s too much. But I just… I don’t want it to be too painful. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. I will let you guide me, and please tell me immediately if you feel any discomfort. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Those are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to gently palpate your spine and back muscles. Could you please lie on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… be careful. It hurts a lot there. I’ll try to stay still. But… it’s really hard not to move when it hurts. But I’ll try. Please just tell me if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to gently press on your spine and the muscles on either side. I’m feeling some tenderness along your lower back, particularly at the L4 and L5 vertebrae. There's also muscle spasm present. Do you feel the pain radiating down your legs when I press there?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s where it hurts the most. Right there. And… yes, it goes down my legs. Not all the way, but… down the back of my legs. Especially my right leg. It feels… like pins and needles sometimes. Like it’s… numb. But also… burning. It’s hard to explain. But pressing there… that’s definitely where it hurts the worst. Please… don’t press too hard. It’s really painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, I understand. I will be very careful. I'm also going to check your range of motion. Could you please try to bend forward, and then to the right, and then to the left?
PATIENT: Okay. Ouch! That really hurts. I can't bend very far. It just… stops. And it hurts too much. It’s the same on both sides. I can’t twist very much either. It just… feels stuck. And it hurts when I try. I… I don’t think I can do much more. It’s too painful. I… I need to stop. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Meigs, you're absolutely right. We'll stop there. You've already told me a great deal, and it's clear that you're in significant pain. Based on your history and the physical examination, I suspect that the cancer has spread to your spine, causing compression fractures and nerve impingement. However, to confirm this diagnosis and assess the extent of the damage, we need to order some imaging tests. I recommend an MRI of your spine. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. If that’s what you think is best. Is it… painful? I don’t like being in small spaces. And I don't want it to hurt more. But… if it will help us figure out what’s going on, then yes. I’ll do it. But please… tell me what to expect. And if it’s going to hurt, please let me know. I just… I get scared easily. Especially when I’m in pain.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Meigs. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about an MRI, especially given your pain and your history. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine. It's not painful, but it does require you to lie very still inside a narrow tube for about 30-60 minutes. It can be a bit claustrophobic, but we can discuss options to help you manage that anxiety, such as a mild sedative or an open MRI machine if available. You will be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. I’ll also order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any other potential causes for your pain. Do you have any questions about the MRI or the blood work?
PATIENT: Um… will the MRI show if the cancer has spread to other places too? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know what’s going on. I’ve been waiting so long, and I just… I want answers. And… how much will all of this cost? I’m really worried about the money. I… I don’t have much. But I need to know what’s going on. And I need to get better. But I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Meigs. Yes, the MRI will help us determine if the cancer has spread to other areas of your spine, as well as check for any potential involvement of other organs. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I will personally review them and discuss them with you in detail as soon as they are available. Regarding the cost, I understand your financial concerns. I will have our billing department contact you to discuss the estimated costs and explore any potential options for financial assistance or payment plans. We will do everything we can to make sure you get the care you need, regardless of your financial situation. I’ll also make sure we submit all appropriate pre-authorizations to your insurance. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage your discomfort while we wait for the results. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything to help with the pain. It’s just… awful. I can barely sleep. And it’s hard to do anything. So… yes, please. Whatever you think is best. And… thank you. Thank you for listening. And for not making me feel like… like I’m just complaining. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate it. I… I just want to feel better. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or should I just wait for the billing department to call?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It's my job to listen and provide the best possible care. I understand how debilitating chronic pain can be, and I'm glad I can help in some way. I'm going to write you a prescription for [Name of pain medication – e.g., Tramadol 50mg, twice daily as needed for pain]. Please take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. I’ll also have the billing department contact you within 24 hours to discuss the costs and payment options. For now, please rest and try to avoid any activities that exacerbate your pain. I’ll be in touch as soon as the MRI results are available. Do you have any questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I… I feel a little bit better just knowing what’s going on. And that you’re going to help me figure it out. I’ll just wait for the billing department to call. And I’ll try to rest. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your appointment to discuss the results. Get some rest, and take care. It was a pleasure meeting you.
