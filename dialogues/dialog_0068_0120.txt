DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's...look, I don’t really do small talk. I just want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? I want to have a baby, and I want it to be…easy. My first one was…complicated enough. I don’t want any trouble this time around. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good starting point. You’re hoping to conceive and want to ensure a smooth pregnancy, given a previous complicated one. Alright. Let’s gather a bit more information so I can assess things properly. Can you tell me a little bit about your previous pregnancy?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was…a long time ago. And stressful. Really stressful. I don’t remember all the details. Something about…high blood pressure, I think? And I was huge! Swollen everywhere. It wasn’t pretty. I just...want this one to be different. I don't want a repeat of that. Do you need dates? Because I really don’t have those offhand. It was…before my husband passed. A while ago, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, stressful pregnancy with some recollection of high blood pressure and significant swelling. And it was prior to your husband's passing. That helps. We can definitely work with that. Do you remember roughly when that pregnancy was?
PATIENT: Ugh, numbers... Why do you need numbers? Look, it was…let me think… before 2018, definitely. Maybe…around 2015? Or 2016? It was a long time ago! Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. Is it that important? I just want to know if I'm going to be okay. Is this going to be a long process? Because I really don’t have a lot of patience for this.
DOCTOR: No, it's not about impatience, Ms. Villarreal, it’s just helpful to get a timeline. Okay, roughly around 2015-2016. Alright. Let's move on to your current health. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Just… vitamins. A multi-vitamin, you know? For general health. And sometimes something for… my joints, they ache. But that’s just when they really bother me. Nothing serious. I try to stay healthy. I eat pretty well, mostly. Don't ask me specifics, though. I don't keep track of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and something for joint pain as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty robust, to be honest. Maybe a little sensitive to… dust sometimes, but that’s it. Not a serious allergy. Look, I’m not one of those people who has a list of things I can’t eat or touch. I just want to make sure I can have a baby, not spend the appointment listing every little sniffle I’ve ever had. Is this standard procedure? It feels like you’re just trying to fill time.
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule out anything that could affect a pregnancy, Ms. Villarreal. Alright. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Great. More digging. Honestly, everyone on both sides has…something. High blood pressure, mostly. And…diabetes, I think? My aunt had it. But everyone’s old! You know? Old people get things. It’s not exactly helpful information, is it? My mother was generally healthy, though. She lived a long time. Can we just…skip this part? It feels like a waste of time, and I’m sure you’ve heard it all before.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll keep it brief. High blood pressure and diabetes in the family. And your mother was healthy. Okay. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you serious? Look, I'm not a degenerate. Of course I don’t do any of those things! I’m a reasonable person. I take care of myself. This is getting ridiculous. I came here to see if I can have a baby, not to be interrogated about my personal life. Honestly, I think I’ve answered enough questions for one day. Can we just move on to…tests or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your frustration. Given your history of a complicated pregnancy with recollections of high blood pressure, and the family history we've discussed, I recommend some baseline blood work to check your overall health, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. We should also check your blood pressure today. The nurse will take you back to draw some blood and measure your blood pressure. I will review the results and we can discuss next steps at that time. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, the sooner I know, the sooner I can either start planning or…not. Just don’t keep me waiting. And please, no more personal questions. Is that too much to ask? Let's just get it done. .
