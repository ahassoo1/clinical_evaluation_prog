DOCTOR: Hello, Edric. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Thanks for having me. It’s…well, it’s my muscles, mostly. They feel really weak, like I’m carrying extra weight even when I’m not. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it's getting harder to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness… and you say it feels like you're carrying extra weight, even when you aren’t?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It’s a strange feeling. Like when you've done a really hard workout and everything aches, but… I haven’t been doing hard workouts. It’s just… there. All the time. Mostly in my legs and arms, I think. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating when it's something persistent that doesn’t have an obvious cause. And you’re right, it is hard to explain sometimes. So, mostly legs and arms… is it worse with certain activities, or is it pretty constant throughout the day?
PATIENT: It's…worse when I try to lift things, obviously. But even just walking up the stairs is getting tough. It's pretty constant, though, to be honest. It doesn’t really go away completely, it just… fluctuates. Some days are better than others, but it's always there, a dull ache and that weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a constant dull ache with fluctuating weakness, worse with exertion like lifting or stairs… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t lost any weight, I don’t think so. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I always chalk that up to just… life. I haven’t noticed any rashes or anything like that. Just the weakness and the ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, dizziness, weight loss, rashes…just the fatigue along with the weakness and ache. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, but nothing major. No broken bones, no surgeries. I haven’t seen a doctor in… honestly, I don’t even remember the last time. Just for check-ups, when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. And you haven't had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis, really bad. Other than that, not much that I know of. Nobody really talked about health much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your grandmother…Do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with muscle weakness or anything similar?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I honestly… don't know. Nobody ever talked about that either. I’m not aware of anyone with similar issues, but that doesn’t mean they didn’t have it and just didn’t say anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a full picture, do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep, the usual. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, vitamins, or supplements. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your muscle strength, reflexes, and things like that. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's just check your height and weight. You're listed as 5'0" and 183 pounds. Is that roughly accurate?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… pretty accurate. Maybe a little over on the weight, honestly. I haven’t weighed myself recently, but yeah, around there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, I’m going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90, pulse is 78, and your temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to assess your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to push against my hands with your arms and legs, okay?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, good strength in your arms. A little discomfort with full extension, we'll make a note of that. Now, let’s check your legs. I’m going to ask you to push your leg against my hand. Okay. Your leg strength is a little weaker than your arms, especially in your ankles. And I noticed some fatigue with those repetitions. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Is that something you’ve noticed before?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I hadn’t really paid attention, to be honest. I guess… maybe a little. It comes and goes. I figured it was just from standing too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll make a note of that. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your knee reflexes are good, but your ankle reflexes are a little diminished. This, along with the weakness and swelling, suggests a few possibilities. Given your elevated blood pressure and the fatigue you mentioned, I think we should run some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying inflammation. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds… thorough. I guess if that's what you think is best. Blood tests are fine. Just… how long is this going to take?
DOCTOR: It won’t take long. I'll order the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and it usually takes about an hour to get the results back. While we’re waiting, we can discuss your lifestyle a little more. Do you have a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Yeah, it can be. I’m an insurance appraiser, mostly auto damage. Lots of walking around looking at cars, getting under them sometimes, taking photos. And sometimes I have to move things around to get a better look. It's not lifting heavy stuff all the time, but it’s definitely not a desk job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that could be contributing to the fatigue and discomfort. While we’re waiting for the results, I also want to ask about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not great. I grab breakfast if I have time – usually just coffee and a pastry. Lunch is usually a sandwich or something quick, whatever’s around. And dinner… well, my cooking skills are limited, so takeout a lot. I know, I know, it's not ideal. I don't really have time to cook.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how much water do you drink throughout the day?
PATIENT: Not enough. I drink coffee, mostly. And maybe a soda with lunch. Water… I try to drink some, but I forget. It’s bad, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll address that later. Alright, the results are in. Your kidney function is slightly elevated, which could explain some of the fatigue and swelling. Your electrolytes are within normal range. However, your Vitamin D level is quite low, and your inflammatory markers are mildly elevated. This could be contributing to the muscle weakness and discomfort. Given these results, I think we can start with a Vitamin D supplement and a low-dose anti-inflammatory medication to see if that improves your symptoms. We'll also need to work on improving your diet and increasing your water intake. I'll give you a prescription for the Vitamin D and the anti-inflammatory. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I told you, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m going to write you a prescription for Vitamin D 2000 IU daily and a low-dose anti-inflammatory, naproxen 220mg twice daily. It’s important to take the naproxen with food to avoid stomach upset. I also want to recommend increasing your water intake to at least eight glasses a day and incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein into your diet. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you're doing. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, please call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… hopefully this actually works. Thanks, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our visit and the prescriptions for you. Remember, consistency is key. Make those lifestyle changes, take the medication as prescribed, and we’ll see how you’re doing in a month. If you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Edric.
