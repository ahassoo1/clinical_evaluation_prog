DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. Please, have a seat. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to put it plainly, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s become…difficult, you see. And I was wondering if there’s maybe…something that could help.
DOCTOR: Difficult, you say. Can you elaborate on that, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, I used to be quite active, you know? Making the models…it kept me moving. But…after my wife passed, I just…stopped. And it’s been hard to get back into it. I try, but…it’s just not the same. And the weight…it’s just kept coming on. I feel…sluggish, Doctor. Very sluggish. I’ve tried cutting back on food, but it doesn’t seem to make much of a difference anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long ago did your wife pass, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: Almost two years now, Doctor. February of '23. It feels like…a lifetime ago, and yesterday, all at once. It’s…hard to explain. It really changed everything, you see. I’m…still adjusting, I suppose. But I need to get my health back on track. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the weight gain and sluggishness, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my knees have been bothering me more lately. Makes walking difficult, even just around the house. And I get…winded easily. Climbing the stairs…it’s a chore now. And…sometimes, I just feel very tired, even after a full night’s sleep. Not just tired, you understand, but…empty. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe. I suppose that’s just…old age creeping up on me. But I'd like to feel better, if I can.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I haven’t lost my appetite, no. I still enjoy my food. Maybe too much, if I’m honest. But even when I try to eat less…the weight just stays on. That’s what’s so frustrating. It’s not like I’m constantly indulging, but…it doesn’t seem to matter what I do. I’ve always enjoyed cooking, you see. Chamorro cooking…it’s very flavorful. And often…rich. I suppose that doesn’t help either.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Osumi?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribes, mostly. For my blood pressure. A small dose, nothing fancy. And sometimes, something for my knees when they’re really bad. But that's only as needed, you understand. Mostly, just the blood pressure medication, Doctor. Everything else…I try to manage on my own. Though clearly, I could use some help now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi. And do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I’m aware of. I’ve always been lucky that way. No allergies. I can eat just about anything. Though, I try to avoid too much sugar these days…just for health’s sake, you know? But it’s not an allergy, just…a preference, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds fine. Whatever you need. I just…want to feel better. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, lie down on the table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, though slightly…accentuated. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are within normal limits. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78. And finally, let's just take a quick look at your knees. There is some crepitus and mild swelling in both knees. Range of motion is slightly limited.
PATIENT: Yes, that's where the pain is the worst, Doctor. Especially when it’s cold. It’s been getting worse lately, as you can see. I try to keep moving, but…it's hard when it hurts. What do you think, Doctor? Is it just old age? Or is there something more I can do? I'm really hoping to avoid surgery, if possible. I’ve always been…active, you see. I don’t want to lose that.
DOCTOR: It appears you have some osteoarthritis in both knees, Mr. Osumi. It’s a common condition, especially with age and previous activity. It’s not simply “old age,” but a degeneration of the cartilage in the joints. The pain you’re experiencing is consistent with that. We can discuss some non-surgical options. Weight management will be crucial, as excess weight puts additional stress on your joints. We can also consider physical therapy to strengthen the muscles surrounding your knees and improve your range of motion. Medication can help manage the pain and inflammation. However, given your blood pressure reading of 140/90, we will also need to address that. It's slightly elevated, and we need to get that under control to prevent further complications.
PATIENT: I see. Yes, my doctor has mentioned my blood pressure before. I try to watch my salt intake, but…it’s hard. Chamorro food…it’s very flavorful. I suppose you're right though. It's all connected, isn't it? What about the weight loss medication, Doctor? Is that a possibility, given my blood pressure? And what kind of medication would you recommend for the knees? I’m willing to try anything, as long as it doesn't involve surgery. But I'm also a little worried about side effects. I've heard stories…
DOCTOR: Weight loss medication is a possibility, but it’s not a simple solution, Mr. Osumi. There are potential side effects, and it needs to be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes—diet and exercise—to be effective. Given your blood pressure, we would need to carefully consider which medication is appropriate, as some can actually raise blood pressure. For your knees, we can start with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug—an NSAID—to help reduce pain and inflammation. However, long-term use can have side effects, so we would need to monitor your kidney function. We can also consider a topical NSAID, which has fewer systemic side effects. Before we proceed, I recommend a comprehensive blood panel to assess your overall health and kidney function. And I would like to refer you to a physical therapist to develop a tailored exercise program. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…reasonable. Blood work, physical therapy…whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just…want to feel better. And what about the weight loss medication? Is there one you recommend, given my blood pressure? And what kind of side effects should I be aware of? I'd like to be prepared, you see. I'm not looking for a miracle cure, just something to help me get started. It’s just…hard to do it on my own. Especially after everything…
DOCTOR: Given your blood pressure, I would recommend starting with phentermine. It’s an appetite suppressant that can help you reduce your caloric intake. However, it can cause side effects such as increased heart rate, insomnia, and anxiety. We will need to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate closely while you are taking it. It's also important to be aware that phentermine is a stimulant and can be habit-forming. It's crucial to use it only as directed and to avoid using it for extended periods. I will write you a prescription for phentermine and a referral to a physical therapist. I will also order the comprehensive blood panel. Please, schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and your progress with the medication and physical therapy. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your patience. It’s…a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll schedule the blood work and the follow-up appointment. And I’ll try to be diligent with the medication and the physical therapy. I’m willing to do whatever it takes to get my health back on track. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Osumi. Remember to adhere to the instructions carefully, and do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any adverse effects. Good day, Mr. Osumi.
