DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Kalinski, is it? Yes, well… it’s these little… spells. My wife, she says I’ve been a bit… off. Confused, she calls it. I don’t know about that. I just… forget things sometimes. Not important things, mind you. But enough to bother her, apparently.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s good that your wife is observant and bringing this to our attention. It’s quite common for memory to fluctuate a bit as we get older, but it's always best to investigate when there's a noticeable change. When did you and your wife first notice these “spells,” as you call them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… a few months now, I suppose. Maybe since the rainy season started? Yes, around then. It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it all blurs together, doesn't it? She noticed it first, I think, when I kept asking where I put my slippers. Then the remote… always the remote. Simple things, really. But she gets very… agitated about it.
DOCTOR: I see. So, roughly since the start of the rainy season – about three or four months ago. And it seems to be primarily with remembering the location of frequently used objects?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Slippers, the television remote, my glasses even! Though I have them on now, haven’t I? It’s not like I’m wandering off, Doctor. I know where I am, I know who you are… it’s just… details. And it's frustrating, you know? I used to be able to recall everything. Dates, numbers… anything. Now… it’s like little pieces are missing. It's… unsettling. My wife keeps talking about seeing a specialist, but I think she's overreacting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Lason, and it's good that you're able to articulate that. It’s also understandable why your wife is concerned. Memory changes can be unsettling for both the individual experiencing them and their loved ones. It’s good you’re seeking answers. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about your general health?
PATIENT: General health, you say? Well, I’m… not exactly spry, if that’s what you mean. I’m 66, you know. Things ache. My knees bother me, especially when it's cold. I try to stay active, do a little work with the tiling when I can, but it's not like I’m climbing mountains. I’ve always been a bit… thin, even when I was younger. I eat… well, my wife cooks. Mostly Cambodian food, you know, rice and fish. Not much red meat. And I drink a little tea, but mostly water. I haven’t been to a doctor in… goodness, I can’t even remember. Years, certainly. Medicare covers most things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful information. So, some joint pain, particularly in the knees, a generally healthy diet of rice and fish, and it's been some time since your last physical exam. Now, have you experienced any other changes besides the memory lapses?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Hmm. Let me think… My wife says I’ve been a bit… quieter, perhaps. Not as much to say. I used to enjoy a good conversation, you know, talking about the old days, the village, everything. But lately… I just don’t have the energy. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not falling, mind you, but just… off balance. Like I’m walking on sand. It doesn't happen often, but it's there. And… oh, yes! My sleep. It’s been… disrupted. I wake up in the middle of the night, can’t get back to sleep. Little things, really. But they add up, don’t they?
DOCTOR: They do add up, Mr. Lason. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Quietness, decreased energy, occasional unsteadiness, and disrupted sleep… these are all important details. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… high blood pressure, the doctor said, years ago. I took some pills for it, but I stopped after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. Never had diabetes, as far as I know. My wife always made sure I ate healthy. Heart… well, my father had some problems with his heart, but that was a long time ago. I've never been hospitalized for anything serious, if that's what you mean. Just… a few aches and pains, that's all. And I've had the usual… the flu, a cold, things like that. Nothing major. I don't recall ever seeing a specialist, no. Just my regular doctor, years ago. He retired, I think. That’s when I… well, stopped going.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. So, a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, but discontinued, and a family history of heart problems. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure pills you stopped taking, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little vitamin D sometimes, during the winter months. My wife buys it for me. Says I don’t get enough sun. But that’s it. I don’t like taking pills, you know? Always felt like they did more harm than good. I try to stay natural, eat healthy, get enough rest. That’s what my mother always said. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a little rice wine on special occasions. No smoking, never have. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She's a very… practical woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. Just vitamin D occasionally, no other medications, and a very healthy lifestyle. Now, I'd like to ask about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat all sorts of things, Cambodian food, you know, lots of different herbs and spices. My wife makes sure everything is fresh. I've never had a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that. So, no, I don't think I have any allergies. Not that I'm aware of. Though, come to think of it, I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm working in the garden… but that's probably just the plants.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful. Now, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and doing a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I suppose it's better to know, isn't it? Though I doubt you'll find anything wrong. I'm a sturdy man, you know. Just a little… forgetful lately. But go ahead, Doctor. Do your work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 148/92. Pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, and there’s some mild unsteadiness when walking heel-to-toe. I also observe a slight tremor in his hands when they are outstretched. Alright, Mr. Lason. I’ve completed the physical exam. I noticed a few things - slightly elevated blood pressure, a mild heart murmur, diminished reflexes, and some mild unsteadiness and tremor. These findings, along with your reported symptoms of memory loss, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, are concerning and warrant further investigation. I would like to order some blood tests and a possible MRI of the brain to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI…? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is something wrong? I thought you said I was sturdy. Blood tests, alright, I suppose. But an MRI… what are you looking for? I don't like the sound of that at all. Is it painful? And expensive? My wife… she worries about these things. Is it something bad, Doctor? You can be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when hearing about an MRI. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that provides detailed pictures of the brain. It doesn’t use any radiation and isn’t painful. You'll simply lie on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The reason I’m recommending it is because your symptoms – the memory loss, fatigue, unsteadiness, and changes in reflexes – could be caused by a number of things. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency or a minor stroke, or it could be something more serious, like early signs of dementia or a tumor. The MRI will help us rule out any of those more serious possibilities and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. As for expense, we will submit the tests to Medicare, and they should cover a significant portion of the cost. We can also explore any financial assistance programs if needed. I want to assure you that I’m not jumping to any conclusions. We’re simply being thorough and taking the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis so we can develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Dementia… my mother, she had that, towards the end. It wasn’t pleasant. I don’t want that. But… you’re right. Better to know, I suppose. Even if it’s bad. Medicare will cover it? You’ll help us with that? Alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Blood tests, MRI… whatever it takes. But please… be gentle. And keep my wife informed. She worries so much. Tell her everything. And if it is something bad… well, just be honest. I’m an old man, Doctor. I’ve lived a good life. But I still want to know what’s happening. And… what to expect.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Lason. I will absolutely keep your wife informed every step of the way, and I promise to be honest with both of you. We will discuss all the results together, and I will explain everything in a clear and understandable manner. I will arrange the blood tests for you today, and we can schedule the MRI as soon as possible. The lab results usually take a few days, and the MRI results may take a bit longer. Once we have all the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and avoid any strenuous activity. I will also provide you with some resources about memory loss and dementia, just in case. And please, don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’m here to support you and your wife through this process. Now, I’ll have my nurse come in to draw the blood and provide you with the necessary paperwork for the MRI. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you… for being honest. And for not dismissing me. My wife… she’ll be relieved you’re taking it seriously. Just… hurry up with the results, if you can. The not knowing… that’s the worst part. Alright. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will do my best to expedite the results. I understand how unsettling the uncertainty can be. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. And remember, we’re in this together. I’ll be here to support you every step of the way.
