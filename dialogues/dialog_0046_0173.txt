DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Glowka, it’s nice to meet you too! Um, well, I’ve just been feeling really cold lately. Like, I get the chills, even when it's warm out. It’s been going on for a couple of days now, and it's starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling cold and having chills even when the temperature is normal can be quite concerning. A couple of days, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two or three days. It comes and goes, but it's definitely not normal for me. Usually, I’m okay, you know? I don’t get cold easily. It's just…weird. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: I agree, a sudden change like that is worth investigating. Besides the chills, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this feeling of coldness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. I haven't had a fever, I don’t think. Maybe a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? No cough, no sore throat, no aches… just the chills. Oh! And maybe a little bit of a headache, but it’s not bad, it comes and goes too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so chills, intermittent headache, and some fatigue. No fever, cough, sore throat, or body aches. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Not much, really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, things like that. Nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that's about it. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, honestly. I try to stay healthy. No big health problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. All natural! I haven't needed anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Um, my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad…he had diabetes, but he passed away a few years ago. Nothing else major that I know of, really. My siblings are healthy, as far as I know. We don’t really talk about health stuff much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, barely drink any alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon. And definitely no drugs. I try to live pretty clean, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. I really try to get everything I need from my food. I’m pretty careful about what I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I’ve eaten everything, tried everything... never had a reaction. I think I would know by now, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would certainly know. Alright, Ms. Aslan, with your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your lymph nodes, among other things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Glowka. I trust your judgment. Let's get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Skin is warm and dry, no rashes detected. Okay, everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Do you feel any pain when I do that?
PATIENT: No, that didn't hurt at all. Just a little tap. Nothing unusual. So…what do you think? Is it something serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Based on the physical exam, there are no obvious signs of a serious infection or acute illness. However, the chills are still concerning and warrant further investigation. Since your symptoms are relatively new and there’s no fever or other classic signs of illness, I'd like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes. We'll check a complete blood count to look for signs of infection or anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out any thyroid issues. Thyroid problems can sometimes cause feeling cold and fatigue. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work seems sensible. I'd rather check everything out just to be safe. So…thyroid, you said? That’s…something I hadn't even thought about. Okay, yeah, let's do the blood work. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so I’ll write you a requisition form and you can have the blood drawn right away. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a fever, severe headache, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please call the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, I think that all makes sense. 24-48 hours…okay, I can do that. No fever or anything, got it. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Thank you, Dr. Glowka. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Aslan. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood now. Please let me know if you have any discomfort during the procedure. And don’t hesitate to call if any new symptoms arise before we review the results. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again. I will.
