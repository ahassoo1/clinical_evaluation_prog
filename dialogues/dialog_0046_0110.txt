DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you too. Oh, my, you are a young doctor! Well… I suppose I’m here because I feel… a little bit worn out. Like I need a good… reset, you know? A jumpstart. I’ve been feeling it for a little while now, and I thought it was best to come see someone before it gets worse. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling worn out and wanting to feel like yourself again is a very valid reason to come in. It's good you're being proactive about this. When you say "a little while now," could you give me a rough estimate of how long you've been experiencing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not been sudden, you see. It’s… maybe six months, now? Possibly a little longer. It started gradually, just feeling tired more easily. I used to be able to do so much gardening, and now… well, now I need a little nap after just a bit of weeding. And I don't have the energy to cook like I used to. It’s just… little things, really, but they add up.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – a gradual onset over about six months. And it sounds like it’s impacting your daily activities, which is important. You mentioned gardening and cooking – are there any other activities you've noticed becoming more difficult due to this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I used to be very involved with the church. Helping with the flowers, visiting people… but lately I just haven’t had the… the oomph to do it. And my grandchildren… I love to spend time with them, but even playing simple games with them tires me out quickly. It makes me feel bad, you know? I don’t want to be the grandma who’s always resting. It's silly, I suppose, but it bothers me. I used to have so much energy for them.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all, Ms. McNabb. It's completely understandable that you'd feel bothered by that. It sounds like this is affecting your quality of life and things you enjoy, and that's important to address. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I have been sleeping more, but it’s not… restful sleep. I wake up several times during the night. And sometimes I feel a little… achy. Not a sharp pain, just a general soreness, especially in my shoulders and back. And… oh dear, I’m terrible with remembering things these days. Not big things, usually, but little things. Like where I put my glasses… which is ironic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. McNabb – that’s very common! It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of fatigue, disrupted sleep, some aches and pains, and some difficulty with memory. That gives us a good starting point. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And I haven’t lost any weight, if anything I might have gained a little. My daughter keeps telling me I need to watch what I eat! But no, definitely no weight loss. I eat pretty regularly, although I haven't been cooking much lately like I said, so it's been a lot of simpler things. I do try to eat my vegetables though.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it's positive you’re maintaining an appetite. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of, such as diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had a touch of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, the doctor told me so. It flares up sometimes, but it’s not too bad. I take some over-the-counter medicine for it when it bothers me. Otherwise… I think I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My mother lived to be 95, so I guess good genes help!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about your mother – good genes are a definite plus! And good that your arthritis is generally manageable. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, when I was still quite young. And I had a hysterectomy as well, a long time ago. Other than that… no, nothing else. They were both quite routine, I don’t think they’re relevant now. Although, sometimes I wonder if the hysterectomy had something to do with how I feel now, but that was so long ago…
DOCTOR: It's good to have that information, even if they were some time ago, as medical history can sometimes reveal patterns. And you're right, it's good to consider all possibilities. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my arthritis, I take ibuprofen as needed. And sometimes I take a little bit of Tylenol for headaches. Oh, and I take a multivitamin every day, my daughter insists on that too! And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it. I always worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: That's sensible. And it’s good you’re mindful of potential side effects. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had any allergies, as far as I know. No reactions to any medications or foods, never. I am very lucky in that regard, I suppose. It’s one less thing to worry about!
DOCTOR: That is good to hear. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a bit of a long story. My mother, like I said, lived to be 95. Her mother also lived a long life, but my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when he was in his early seventies. And my brother… he had diabetes. It runs in the family, I think. Oh, and my aunt on my husband’s side had arthritis, quite badly. It seems to be a family thing, these aches and pains!
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Heart problems and diabetes are both important to note, as is the arthritis. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a bit when he was younger, but he quit years ago. I always told him it was terrible for his health. I always believed in taking care of myself, you see.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And do you drink alcohol, and if so, how often?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, maybe once a month or so. It's just a little treat, you know? I don't drink much at all.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And lastly, could you tell me a bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I used to be very active. Gardening, church activities… I kept myself busy. But lately, with the fatigue, I haven’t been doing as much. I try to go for a short walk every day, but even that tires me out sometimes. I mostly just take it easy now, you see. I mostly sit and read or watch television. It's not very exciting, but it's all I can manage these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this fatigue has significantly impacted your ability to enjoy your usual activities. Well, Ms. McNabb, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to feel like myself again, you see. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, but I did detect a faint murmur – that’s something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft and normal. Your reflexes and strength are good. Now, just a few quick neurological checks… Everything seems generally okay, but the fatigue and murmur warrant further investigation. I think it's wise to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. Also, an EKG would be helpful to assess your heart rhythm more closely. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. If that will help figure out what’s going on, then please do. Blood work and an EKG… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to know what’s causing this tiredness, you see. It’s just… draining. So, yes, please go ahead with the tests. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. I completely understand. It's good you’re being proactive about this. I’ll order the blood work and EKG right away. The lab should be able to draw the blood today, and the EKG can be done here in the clinic before you leave. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. My nurse will call you as soon as they are available to discuss them with you and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today, or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for listening to me and taking such good care of me. It makes me feel better just knowing we’re looking into it. 24-48 hours… I can wait. And I will be sure to go to the emergency room if I feel anything like you said. You’ve been very kind. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. My nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG. Have a good day, and please try to rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye now. .
