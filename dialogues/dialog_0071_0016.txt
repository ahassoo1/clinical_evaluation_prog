DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Or… is it Nicky, do you prefer?
PATIENT: Nicky is fine. Though, frankly, I find this whole thing a bit… unnecessary. I’ve been seeing doctors for decades, and I usually just explain what’s going on. All this formality… But yes, Nicky is fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nicky. I understand. We just like to cover all our bases, you know?
PATIENT: Covering bases. Right. Well, let's just get on with it then. It’s the bruising, obviously. It’s getting… noticeable. And my wife – well, was my wife – always worried about these things. She’d have a fit if she saw me now.
DOCTOR: Bruising, yes. And it's been… getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Hmm. It’s hard to say exactly. It's not like I keep a calendar for every little bump. But definitely more than usual. I knocked my arm on the doorframe a couple of days ago – a light knock, I assure you – and it turned purple almost immediately. That’s not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not typical, Nicky. A light knock shouldn't cause that kind of bruising. Have you noticed bruising anywhere else?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my legs have a few spots. Nothing major, just… discoloration. I thought it was from the gardening, honestly. I do a fair bit of work out there. Though, I suppose I could have bumped into things. I don't recall anything specific. It's hardly a matter for a doctor, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Nicky. But unexplained bruising can sometimes be a sign of something else going on. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to it, are we? The history. Well, I’ve had the usual things. High blood pressure, managed with medication, of course. A bit of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn't these days? And, as I said, I'm on a blood thinner – Warfarin, I believe. Been on it for… oh, five years now? After the… incident. Really, I don’t see what any of this has to do with a few bruises.
DOCTOR: The Warfarin is important, yes. That definitely explains some of the bruising, but not necessarily all of it, especially if it’s appearing with minimal trauma. And the blood pressure medication... is that still being managed regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly? Of course it is! I go to the pharmacy every month for the refill. They check things, don't they? I’m not a fool, Doctor. I understand the importance of managing these things. It’s just… I find this whole line of questioning a bit insulting. Are you implying I’m not taking care of myself?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Nicky. I apologize if I came across that way. I'm simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. It's my job to ask these questions, you see. And believe me, I understand your frustration. A little reassurance goes a long way. Would you mind if I quickly examined your arms and legs, just to take a look at the bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be impressed. It's just bruising, Doctor. Not a medical miracle. And be gentle, I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some ecchymosis here on both arms, varying in size and age. And similar findings on the legs. There doesn’t appear to be any active bleeding or swelling. Are these areas painful to the touch, Nicky?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not particularly. A little tender, perhaps, if you press hard. But it’s not like a broken bone or anything. Honestly, it feels… like a normal bruise. A rather large, unsightly normal bruise, admittedly. Is this going to take long? I have a garden to tend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything appears stable, Nicky. No signs of acute injury or significant swelling. Given your history of Warfarin use, some bruising is expected. However, the ease with which it occurs and the size of the ecchymosis… it warrants further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your Warfarin levels and rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More tests. Of course. Just what I needed. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, I suppose. But honestly, I'm starting to feel like a lab rat. Is this really necessary? I feel fine, aside from looking like I've been in a fight. If you insist, I suppose I can get it done. But I expect a clear explanation of what you're looking for, and I expect it to be quick. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nicky. It’s not ideal, I agree. The blood work will help us determine if your Warfarin dosage is within the therapeutic range. It also checks for any other potential causes of easy bruising, such as low platelets or other clotting factors. It’s just a precaution, to ensure your safety. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the order ready for you. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. And we can discuss the results as soon as they come in. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Get the order ready, and let’s get this over with. Though I still think it’s a waste of my time. And if everything comes back normal, I expect a full apology for the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nicky. I’ll get the order ready for you right away. And we'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Don’t hesitate to let the nurses know if you experience any unusual bleeding or bruising in the meantime. Easy bruising… always a tricky one. .
