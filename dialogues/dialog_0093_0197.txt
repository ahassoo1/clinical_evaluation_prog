DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. I want to keep working, you see. It's… complicated, but I drive people around sometimes. It’s important to me to stay active.
DOCTOR: Of course, San. A medical card for commercial driving – that’s a Certificate of Fitness, often required for ride-sharing. I understand wanting to stay active, and it's excellent that you're being proactive about this. To get that certificate, we'll need to perform a thorough medical examination. This will involve reviewing your medical history, a physical exam, and potentially some simple tests. First, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Doctor Tanaka. Very good man. I see him… let me think… every six months, usually. He’s the one who suggested I come here, actually. Said I needed someone who could do this specific card thing. I haven't had any big problems, if that makes sense. Just… old age creaks, you know?
DOCTOR: “Old age creaks,” yes, I understand completely. That’s a perfectly reasonable way to put it. It’s good to hear you have a regular doctor in Dr. Tanaka, and that he recommended our clinic. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about those “creaks”?
PATIENT: Well… my knees bother me sometimes. Especially when it's cold, or if I've been sitting for too long. And my back… it's not what it used to be. I used to do a lot of heavy lifting in my work, you see. Logging equipment, as they say. Not so much anymore, thankfully. But it still flares up now and then. Nothing that stops me from driving, though. I can still get in and out of the truck just fine.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, San. It's helpful to know about the knee and back discomfort, and the history of heavy lifting. Just to clarify, when you say “flares up,” could you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… a stiffness, mostly. And a little bit of pain. Not sharp, really. More of a dull ache. It gets worse if I try to twist or bend. And sometimes it radiates down my leg a little. But like I said, it doesn’t stop me from working. I just… take it easy. And I don’t lift anything heavy anymore. I’m careful. I’ve learned to be. It hasn’t been getting worse lately, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear it hasn't been progressively worsening. The stiffness and dull ache, radiating down the leg… that sounds like it could be related to some arthritis or muscle strain. To get a clearer understanding, could you tell me if this discomfort is present in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right leg. My left leg is okay, thank you. Though, sometimes if I sit for too long, it gets a little stiff too. But nothing like my right one. It's… it's just a fact of getting older, I suppose. I just want to make sure I can still do what I need to do. Driving keeps me going, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, San. It's very admirable that you're staying active and want to continue driving. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam to assess your range of motion and identify any areas of particular concern. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and some basic neurological functions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. I’ve had plenty of that in my life.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, San. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. Now, let's move on to examining your musculoskeletal system. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Okay. Oh, dear. Not as far as I used to, that’s for sure. The knees… they protest a little.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you please stand and slowly rotate your hips in a circular motion, both clockwise and counterclockwise?
PATIENT: Okay. There’s a bit of a… creak in there, I’m afraid. Old age, you see. It's not painful, just… noticeable. I’m not a young woman anymore, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. It’s important to be honest about these things. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably. I'm going to gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Grip strength is good bilaterally. Finally, let's quickly assess your range of motion in your shoulders and elbows. Could you please raise your arms overhead and rotate them inward and outward?
PATIENT: Okay. A little tight, but I can do it. I still need to reach things on high shelves, you see. Can’t let things get out of reach. It’s a little slower than it used to be, but I’m not complaining.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That completes the physical exam for now. Everything seems generally good, though we do see some expected age-related changes in your joints. To be thorough, I'd like to order some basic blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your discomfort, such as arthritis or inflammation. It will include a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, and a Rheumatoid Factor test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps make sure I can keep driving, I’m happy to do it. Just let me know where to go and when. I have my Medicare card with me. Here you are. And thank you for being so patient with an old woman.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. And please, don’t apologize for your age. It comes with wisdom and experience. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You can go whenever you're ready. They’ll need a copy of your insurance card and a requisition form, which my assistant, Emily, will prepare for you before you go. She’s just over there. Once the results are back, typically in about three to five business days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you meet the requirements for the Certificate of Fitness. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. Three to five days… that sounds reasonable. Emily, you said? I'll find her. Thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll go find Emily now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions along the way. And please, take your time. Emily will be happy to help. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
