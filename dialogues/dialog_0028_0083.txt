DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kammer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Early Kammer. And you are the doctor, yes? Ronnisha... Memmolo, I believe? A nice name. It’s good to finally meet you. I been waitin’ a little bit, but no big deal. Time is... time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Memmolo. And you're here today because...?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not a big problem, you understand. Just... feelin' a little low. Not sick, exactly. More like… needin’ a little somethin’ to lift the spirits. My daughter, she says I should ask you for one of those… get well cards. Or a card with… encouragement. You know, somethin’ positive. She thinks it will help. Women, always thinkin’. But I figured, can’t hurt, right?
DOCTOR: A… get well card?
PATIENT: Yes. That's right. A card. With… nice words. Like, “Hang in there” or “Things will get better.” My daughter, she’s very… proactive. She says a little positivity from a doctor can do wonders. I don’t usually go for all that, but she insisted. It’s not like I’m ill, mind you. Just… a bit down. A little somethin’ to remind me things aren't so bad, you know? Is that… unusual? I’m not askin’ for medicine, just a card.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. I treat medical conditions. I don’t… prescribe encouragement. What specific symptoms are you experiencing that are causing you to “feel low”?
PATIENT: Well now, hold on a minute. I am explainin’ to you! I told you I feel… low. Like somethin’ is missin’. Not much energy. Sleepin’ alright, I guess. Eatin’… okay. It’s just a general feelin’ of… blah. And my daughter, she said a card from you would help. She says you’re a good doctor and people listen to you. I thought maybe you could write somethin’ nice on it? I’m not askin’ for a miracle, just a little bit of helpin’ words. It’s a simple request. What do you do if someone just… feels a little down, then? You just ignore them?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I need specifics. “Feeling low” is not a diagnosis. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Like I said, Doctor, not much change. I eat. Not like a horse, mind you. I’m not a big eater. But I don’t go without. Steak now and then, you know? Chicken. A little rice. Sometimes some beans. My daughter, she worries too much. She makes a big deal out of everything. I’m a man, I can handle a little… feelin’ blah. But she said you might have some… ideas. Is this somethin’ you usually deal with, people just feelin’ a little… not right? Because I’m tellin’ you, a nice card might just be the ticket. A few kind words, that's all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, have you noticed any difficulty sleeping despite sleeping alright?
PATIENT: Now you're just askin' the same thing over and over! I said I sleep alright! Not the best sleep in the world, mind you, but I get enough. I don’t toss and turn all night. I wake up… rested enough. What are you tryin' to get at, Doctor? I’m tellin’ you, a little encouragement, a card with some nice words, would really help. It’s not complicated. You’re makin’ this much harder than it needs to be. Is there somethin’ wrong with just wantin' a little pick-me-up?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I’m going to ask you this one last time. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Honestly, Doctor, you’re fixatin’ on nothin’. I haven’t been weighin’ myself every day, I’m not a… a weight fanatic! Maybe a pound or two, up or down. It fluctuates, you know? Like the ocean. Depends on what I eat, what I do. But nothin’ drastic. Look, I'm a simple man. I come to you, I tell you I feelin' a little down, and you're askin' about my weight? My daughter said you were a good listener. You're makin' me regret comin’ in here, to be honest. I just wanted a little card. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I believe we've reached an impasse. I can’t fulfill your request for a… motivational card. I suggest you speak with a therapist. Here’s a referral. Next patient.
