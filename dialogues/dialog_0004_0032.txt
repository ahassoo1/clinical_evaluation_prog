DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… a rather delicate matter, you see. An… issue I’ve been experiencing. It’s quite bothersome, really. A… discharge. Yes, a discharge. Not something a man of my age expects, I assure you. Though, frankly, at my age, one expects something to be failing. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. It’s… well, it’s not constant, you understand. Comes and goes. Sometimes there’s a bit of… discomfort. A stinging, perhaps. It's difficult to say precisely. It’s been… a few weeks, I believe? Though time does rather slip away these days. I wouldn't say it's painful, exactly. More… irritating. Do you follow? It's hardly a topic one discusses with… anyone, you see. Especially not my wife. She wouldn't understand.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Mr. Krok. A few weeks of intermittent discharge with some stinging... Is this discharge from the urethra – where you urinate – or somewhere else?
PATIENT: The… urethra? Is that the… the pipe, you mean? Yes, I believe so. It’s coming from… there. Though, frankly, all the plumbing down there feels rather interconnected these days. It's certainly not from… back there. Goodness, no. I’m fairly certain it's the… pipe. Though, I must confess, I haven’t examined it closely. It’s not something one does casually, you see. It's simply… there when it is. And then it’s not. Does that clarify matters?
DOCTOR: It does, to a degree. Has the color or consistency of the discharge changed at all over these few weeks?
PATIENT: Color… consistency… really, Doctor, you ask rather precise questions. I’m not a chemist, you know. It’s… whitish, I suppose. Or perhaps yellowish. It’s not bright, certainly. And the consistency… watery, sometimes. Other times… thicker. Like… mucus, perhaps? Though, I’m not an expert on mucus either. It’s all rather unpleasant, really. It’s not blood, if that’s what you’re thinking. I would certainly know that. Though, frankly, I try not to look too closely. It’s a gentleman’s… privacy, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Whitish or yellowish, sometimes thicker like mucus, no blood… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this discharge, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I’ve felt a bit… tired, perhaps. But then, at my age, one is tired. I wouldn't attribute that to… this. And I've had to… urinate a bit more frequently, I suppose. But that could be the tea. My wife insists on me having several cups a day. It's a good tea, you understand. Earl Grey. So, no, I wouldn't say I've noticed anything particularly… alarming. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. And the… discharge, of course. A rather unwelcome addition, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Certainly not. I keep a very close watch on my temperature, you see. Very important. And no chills. It's been rather warm lately, thankfully. And no pain… not really. Perhaps a slight… discomfort, as I mentioned. But not pain. Definitely not. I pride myself on my resilience, you see. I’ve survived a great deal in my life. A bit of discomfort is hardly… alarming. It’s just… bothersome. A nuisance, really. I’d rather not dwell on it. It’s hardly a topic for polite conversation, you understand.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your discomfort discussing this. Let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. Well, my wife handles most of that, you see. She’s very organized. I believe… yes, I have what she calls “the pressure.” High blood pressure, I think. It comes and goes. She makes me take pills for it. And… something about cholesterol. It's high, I believe. Another pill. I'm quite the collection of ailments, really. Nothing serious, mind you. Just the usual wear and tear. And I had a touch of… something in my lungs a few years ago. Pneumonia, perhaps? It was quite unpleasant. But I recovered, of course. I’m a survivor, as I mentioned. Does that suffice? I’m afraid I don’t pay close attention to these things. My wife assures me I’m being adequately… medicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or have you had multiple sexual partners?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? Good heavens, Doctor! That’s a rather… personal question. I’ve been married for… well, for a very long time, you see. To the same woman. A devoted wife. The idea… frankly, it's quite preposterous. I’ve lived a very… respectable life. The implication… I find it rather… unsettling. I assure you, I’ve never… well, it’s simply not something one discusses. Especially not with a doctor! It's rather… inappropriate, wouldn't you agree? I’m a man of principles, you see. And fidelity. The very suggestion… I find it quite… offensive, actually. Let's move on, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. I apologize if that question was inappropriate. I ask these questions to ensure I have a complete understanding of your medical background. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yes, well, my wife has a very organized system, you see. Apart from the pills for… the pressure and the cholesterol… let me think. She gives me something for my… joints. Arthritis, I believe. It makes them ache less. And something for my… digestion. I have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. And occasionally, when I can't sleep, she gives me a small pill for that as well. But honestly, Doctor, I can't recall the names. She manages everything. I simply take what she gives me, when she gives it to me. It's… easier that way. I trust her implicitly, you understand. She knows best. A very practical woman, my wife. And very organized. I wouldn't know where I’d be without her. It's… quite a collection, actually. But I assure you, I follow her instructions to the letter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Krok, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and examining the area where you're experiencing the discharge. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh dear. Well, I suppose… it’s necessary, isn’t it? Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of being… prodded and poked. It’s… undignified, really. But if it’s necessary for a diagnosis, then… very well. Though, please be gentle, Doctor. I’m an old man, you see. And my… plumbing is rather delicate. And… please don’t keep me waiting too long. I have a rather important appointment with the gardener this afternoon. He’s promised to prune the roses, and they’re looking rather overgrown. But… yes, proceed. If you must. Though, I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Now, if you could just lower your trousers slightly, I’ll need to examine the area where you're experiencing the discharge. I'll be quick. I note a small amount of whitish discharge from the urethral opening. There is some mild redness and swelling around the opening, but no significant ulceration or lesions. No inguinal lymphadenopathy palpated. Alright, thank you, Mr. Krok. That will be all for the physical exam. You may get dressed now. I’ll be right back with my thoughts.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't entirely unpleasant, thankfully. Though I do feel a bit… exposed. It’s not something one does casually, you understand. A gentleman prefers a degree of… privacy. But I suppose it was necessary. I trust you found something useful? I do hope it's nothing serious. My wife would be most upset if I were to fall ill. She has a very busy schedule, you see. And the roses need pruning. But… yes, please do tell me your thoughts. I’m rather anxious to be done with this whole ordeal. And perhaps get a cup of tea. A strong Earl Grey.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you likely have urethritis – inflammation of the urethra. The discharge you're experiencing, along with the mild redness and swelling, is consistent with that diagnosis. However, the cause of urethritis can be varied. It can be caused by a sexually transmitted infection, though based on your history, that is less likely in your case. More commonly, especially in older men, it can be caused by a non-specific bacterial infection or irritation. We need to determine the exact cause to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. I’m going to order a urine test – a urinalysis – to look for signs of infection and identify any bacteria present. I will also order a test for common sexually transmitted infections, just to be thorough. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to help flush out the urethra. Avoid irritants such as caffeine and alcohol. And I would advise against any sexual activity until we have the results of the tests. Do you have any questions so far, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Good heavens, Doctor, this is becoming quite a complicated affair! I simply came in with a bit of… discharge, and now I’m being subjected to a battery of examinations and analyses. It’s rather… unsettling. And to suggest it might be… something else… it's simply not something I wish to contemplate. As for the fluids… yes, I suppose I can drink more tea. And I haven't been… active in a very long time, thankfully. But to think that it might be… something… I assure you, Doctor, my wife would be most displeased. But if you insist on these tests… then I suppose I must comply. Though I do hope they are quick and painless. And that the results are… favorable. I simply want this whole ordeal to be over. And to get back to my roses. Do you have a sense of how long these tests will take? And… are they expensive? My wife handles the finances, you see.
DOCTOR: The urine tests are relatively quick and painless, Mr. Krok. It simply involves providing a sample in a sterile container. The STI tests involve a blood draw, which may cause a slight pinch. The lab typically has results back within 3-5 business days. As for the cost, I understand your concern. Medicare typically covers these tests, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. I can have the billing department contact your wife directly to provide an estimate. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your lower abdomen or back, please contact me immediately. I'll also provide you with a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic – azithromycin – to take in the meantime, to help manage the infection while we await the test results. It’s a precautionary measure, and we will adjust the treatment if the test results indicate a different cause. Do you have any further questions for me at this point, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? More pills? Good heavens, Doctor, this is becoming quite a regimen! I’m starting to feel like a walking pharmacy. I suppose if it's necessary… but I do hope they don’t have any… unpleasant side effects. My stomach is rather sensitive, you see. And to think that this all started with a bit of… discharge. It’s hardly worth all this fuss, frankly. But if you insist… I suppose I must comply. Though I do hope it’s a quick and effective solution. I believe that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. I simply wish to get this over with. And to get back to my roses. Please do let me know if there is anything else I need to do. And do have the billing department contact my wife, as you suggested. She will appreciate it. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that will be all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I’ll have the nursing staff provide you with a prescription for azithromycin and instructions for collecting a urine sample. I’ll also have the billing department contact your wife directly to provide an estimate of the costs. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll do everything we can to ensure you receive appropriate treatment. We'll review the test results as soon as they're available and adjust the plan as needed. If you experience any concerning symptoms, or if your condition worsens, please don't hesitate to contact me or my office immediately. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Krok. I wish you a speedy recovery, and I hope you're able to get back to your roses soon.
