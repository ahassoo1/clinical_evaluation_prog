DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have a lot of time for this, Doc. It’s… my stomach, I guess. It’s been puffy. Bloated. Feels like I ate a whole Thanksgiving dinner, even when I haven’t. Honestly, it's been going on a while, and it’s annoying. Can we just figure out what’s wrong and get it fixed?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you’re short on time, Mr. Kristofik. We'll try to be efficient. “Bloated” is a good start. Can you tell me when it started?
PATIENT: When… uh. Honestly? Vaguely. A few months, maybe? It comes and goes. I don't really keep track of these things. It's just… there sometimes, and then it’s not. Does it matter exactly when it started? Seems like a waste of time to me.
DOCTOR: It can help narrow things down, but we can work with “a few months.” Is the bloating constant for days at a time, or does it come and go within a single day?
PATIENT: It’s more… throughout the day. Like, I’ll feel okay in the morning, then by afternoon, I’m puffed up like a balloon. Sometimes it lasts into the evening, sometimes not. It’s not, like, always there, if that makes any sense. It just… happens. Look, I drive a pile driver for a living. I don't have time for complicated stomach problems. Is it something I ate? That's what my wife used to say, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it fluctuates throughout the day. And you’re a pile driver – that's good to know, physically demanding work. Has anything specific triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered? What do you mean? Like… emotional triggers? Doc, I'm not one for feelings. It just… happens after I eat, usually. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Sometimes it's a sandwich, sometimes it's leftovers, sometimes it's… I don't know. I eat normal stuff. I used to eat with my wife, and she never had this problem. It's… frustrating, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be related to eating, but not necessarily a specific food. Does it cause you any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? Pain? No, not really pain. Just… uncomfortable. Makes my clothes feel tight, that’s about it. And… gas. A lot of gas. Sorry if that’s too much information, but it’s just… part of it. Doesn't bother me too much, but… well, it's embarrassing, if you want to know the truth. My wife... she used to say I needed to watch what I ate. She always had an opinion on everything. Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable and increased gas. No pain, just bloating and gas. And it started several months ago, related to eating. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen, okay?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have time for poking and prodding, Doc. I have a job to do. Can’t you just give me something for it? Something to stop the… puffiness? I don't understand why we need to do all this. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I want to get you feeling better quickly. But to safely give you anything, I need to rule out a few things. Listening to your abdomen is quick and non-invasive, it will help me get a better understanding of what could be going on. It will only take a minute or two. Otherwise, I can’t recommend any medication without knowing more. It’s a standard part of evaluating stomach issues.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. Just get it over with. But make it quick, okay? And don’t tell me about every little thing you hear. I don't need a lecture on my insides. Honestly, this is ridiculous. My wife would have handled this in five minutes. Just... hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, a little bit of…gurgling, which isn't unusual with gas. No immediate signs of anything concerning. I don't hear anything that would be alarming. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything is painful. I'm pressing lightly… any discomfort?
PATIENT: It's… not painful, exactly. Just… feels full. Like I actually did eat a Thanksgiving dinner. And… stop poking. It’s making it worse. Honestly, you’re just making me more uncomfortable. Can we just skip this part? It's not helping, I can tell you that much. My wife would have known exactly where to press. Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can stop the palpation. Given your symptoms and the exam so far, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of bloating, likely related to gas. There are a few things we can try. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently, besides the obvious—what you're eating?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. I eat the same stuff I always eat. Sandwiches, leftovers… sometimes I get takeout. I haven’t changed anything. Look, I'm a simple man. I don't mess with my food. Honestly, I don’t have time to be experimenting with different diets. I have a job to do, remember? My wife... she was the one who always worried about what we ate. She’d read articles and… never mind. Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history, the exam, and your description, it's possible you are experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. It’s common, and often triggered by stress, diet, or a combination of both. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a simple blood test to check for any underlying inflammation, and a stool test to rule out any infection. It’s routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? More poking and prodding? Look, Doc, I don’t want tests. I want something to fix this. Not more appointments and lab work. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. My wife would have given me a peppermint tea and sent me on my way. Can't you just give me something for the gas? Please? Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your frustration and desire for a quick solution. While I still recommend the tests to rule out other issues, I can prescribe you an over-the-counter medication to help with the gas and bloating in the meantime. It’s called simethicone. It may provide some relief. However, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop fever, blood in your stool, or severe abdominal pain, you need to seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't have allergies. Honestly, I’m not one for taking pills, but… fine. Simethicone. Whatever. Just… tell me where to get it. And can we be done now? I have things to do. Honestly, my wife… never mind. Stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Simethicone is available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. It comes in various forms – tablets, capsules, liquid. Follow the dosage instructions on the package. I'm going to print out a summary of our discussion, and a prescription for the simethicone, and some educational material about IBS. It includes diet modifications and other things that may help. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if they get worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we'll reconsider those tests. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. No questions. Honestly, I've wasted enough time here already. Just… where's the paperwork? And can I go now? Seriously, I need to get back to work. My wife… I just… look, just give me the papers. Stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you are. The nurse will help you schedule a follow-up if needed. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Mr. Kristofik. .
PATIENT: Good day. Honestly… .
