DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. Thank you for seeing me. I… well, I am noticing things. Things I forget. Small things, mostly, but… more often now. It worries me. I am Venus Alvara.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, alright. Forgetfulness... and it’s increasing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. Increasing. It is… unsettling. I used to manage many properties, many details. Dates, names, agreements… all in my head. Now… sometimes a name escapes me. Or a meeting. It is… not good for business, you understand. And it began, I think, around the time my blood pressure went up. The doctor said… hypertensive, he called it.
DOCTOR: Hypertensive… right. And roughly how long ago was that diagnosis?
PATIENT: About… six months, I believe. Perhaps a little longer. It was after my husband… passed away. A difficult time. The doctor prescribed medication, of course. I take it, regularly. But the forgetting… it still happens. It is not… a complete loss, but… troubling.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned you take medication for your blood pressure. Do you recall the name of the medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It is… Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. In the morning, with breakfast. I am very careful with it. I do not like to miss a dose. It is… important to control the pressure. But still, the forgetting… continues. I do not understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And just to clarify, Ms. Alvara, when you say "forgetting," can you give me some specific examples?
PATIENT: Specific examples… hmm. Let me think. Just yesterday, Mrs. Henderson called about a repair to her roof. I knew I had spoken with her about it, I knew it. But I could not remember what we had agreed upon. What the contractor said. I had to… flip through the files. It took me a very long time. And… last week, I scheduled a meeting with the board, but I wrote the wrong time down. Thankfully, Mr. Peterson called to confirm, and we corrected it. Small things, but… frequent now. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, so recent memory issues, affecting scheduling and recall of recent conversations. And these issues are causing you some anxiety. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to concentrate, or any difficulty with tasks that require more complex thought?
PATIENT: Complex thought… that is a good question. I… I believe I can still manage the overall properties. The big picture. But the details… the smaller tasks… they take longer now. I have to check my work more often. And sometimes… I struggle to find the right words. Not often, but… it happens. It is… frustrating. I used to be very quick, very efficient. Now… I feel slower. And I worry it will affect my business. I do not want to… lose my clients.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Alvara, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It's a simple series of questions and tasks to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… assessment? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help. I just… I hope it is not too long. I have appointments this afternoon. I do not want to… delay things further. I am quite busy, you see. But… yes, if you think it is necessary.
DOCTOR: Of course. It shouldn't take more than fifteen or twenty minutes. We can do it right here. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. Let me see… It is August… the second, yes? August 2nd. The year… is 2025, is it not? I believe so. I try to keep track. It is… important. Though sometimes… the days blur together.
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd, 2025. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: This is… a suburban area, yes? I do not… I do not recall the specific name. I travel often, you see, to manage the properties. I am not always… aware of the exact location. I apologize. I should know better, but… my mind is not as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Alvara. No need to apologize. Let’s try something else. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me after I finish. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Please say the words. I will try my best to remember. It… it is a little unnerving, this testing, but I understand you are trying to help. Please proceed.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny. Apple, table, penny. Now, can you repeat those three words back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… hmm. The last word… escapes me. I… I know there were three. Apple, table… I am trying. It is on the tip of my tongue… I apologize. I… I cannot recall the third word. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Alvara. Don’t worry about it. It's not a pass or fail test, it's just to give me a better picture of what's going on. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your medical history. Have you ever had a stroke?
PATIENT: A stroke? No. Never. I have had… high blood pressure, as we discussed. And some… headaches, occasionally. But never a stroke. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but I… I have been fortunate, in that regard. I try to eat healthy, exercise when I can. I do not understand why my memory is failing. It is… worrying. It is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of stroke. High blood pressure, occasional headaches. Ms. Alvara, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief assessment we’ve done, I think it's important to investigate this further. There are several possibilities, and we need to rule out anything serious. I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin B12, and rule out any deficiencies. I also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to look for any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A brain scan… and more blood work? It sounds… rather serious, Doctor. But… yes, if you think it is necessary. I want to know what is happening. I just… I hope it is not anything too… frightening. I have many responsibilities. I cannot afford to be… unwell. But… yes, please proceed with the tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood work and the brain scan. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule the scan for you. It's best to have it done as soon as possible. I also want to discuss a possible referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. They specialize in brain health and can provide a more definitive diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. It's important to manage your stress levels as well. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… wise. More specialists. It is… a lot to take in. No, I do not think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I get the results? And… will this affect my ability to work? I have meetings scheduled next week. I need to know if I should… cancel them. I apologize for asking so many practical questions, but… my business is my livelihood.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. The scan results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week. I will personally review them as soon as they are available and contact you immediately to discuss the findings. As for your meetings, it's best to err on the side of caution. I recommend postponing them until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. It's important to prioritize your health right now. We'll know more once we have the results, and then we can discuss a plan for managing your work and other responsibilities. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Postponing the meetings… yes, I suppose that is prudent. Very well. No, Doctor. I believe that is all for now. Thank you for your time, and for… explaining everything so clearly. I will… await the results. I just… I hope it is nothing serious. It is… unsettling, to not know. Thank you again. I think I will go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
