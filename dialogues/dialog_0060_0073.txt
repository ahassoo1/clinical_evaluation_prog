DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this. It’s my stomach. Been… well, it’s been awful. Just constantly running to the bathroom. They gave me something at urgent care, but it didn’t do anything. And I’m not getting any younger, you know? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. “Constantly running to the bathroom.” Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, it feels like forever. Maybe… a week? A little over? I lost track, to be honest. It’s not like I’m keeping a diary of my bathroom trips. It just started, and it hasn’t stopped. It's really frustrating. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And can you describe what’s happening when you need to go?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's diarrhea! What else needs describing? It’s… watery. A lot of it. And it comes on suddenly. Like, I can be perfectly fine one minute, and then… I have to go. It’s embarrassing, really. I haven't been able to leave the house much, and I hate being cooped up.
DOCTOR: Right, “watery.” And any blood or mucus in the stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You really need to know everything? Look, I told you it's diarrhea, not some fancy medical mystery. I didn't exactly examine it closely, okay? There might be… stuff. I don't know. I’m not a doctor, am I? It's just… unpleasant. Do you need me to bring in a sample or something? Because I really don’t want to.
DOCTOR: No, no, a sample isn't necessary right now. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: No fever. I get a little queasy sometimes, but that could be anything. Honestly, I’ve been so focused on getting to the bathroom that I haven’t really paid attention to much else. And no vomiting, thankfully. I’m just… drained. Tired all the time. This whole thing is exhausting. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just take a look at your history here… You’ve had no recent travel, and no known history of bowel issues?
PATIENT: No travel. And no, I've always had a… regular system, you could say. This is new. I eat pretty normally. I mean, I like my salmon, obviously, but nothing… exotic. I don't go around eating questionable street food. It's just… weird. I'm not usually one to complain about things, but this is really disruptive. My garden is suffering, for one thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any recent changes in your diet or stress levels?
PATIENT: Diet? No. Stress? Well… my husband passed away last year. So, yes. There's been a little bit of stress. But I'm coping. I'm… managing. I don't see how that would cause this, though. It just feels like my stomach is… rebelling. It's embarrassing to even talk about. I don't usually bother doctors with… stomach issues.
DOCTOR: Right, loss of husband last year. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And no allergies, as far as I know. I’ve always been pretty healthy. This… this is really out of character for me. I don't get sick often. It's probably just something I ate, even though I said I haven't changed my diet. Maybe the salmon wasn't fresh? Oh, now I’m second-guessing everything. This is ridiculous. I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s just take a listen to your abdomen, and I'll feel around a bit, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. It’s probably nothing serious, but it's best to rule things out. If you could just lie back on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t take long. I have things to do, you know. And please be gentle. I’m not exactly in the mood for poking and prodding. This whole thing is just… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie flat, and I'll listen with the stethoscope first. Try to relax your abdomen. Deep breaths. Bowel sounds are… hyperactive. A little tender to palpation in the lower left quadrant, but no rebound tenderness. No masses palpated. Okay. Everything seems… within normal limits, but your abdomen is definitely a little irritated.
PATIENT: Irritated? Well, no wonder it’s irritated. It’s been constantly churning for a week! What does “irritated” even mean? Is it serious? Are you going to give me some kind of medication that actually works? I really don’t have time for a drawn-out investigation, you know. I need to get back to my garden. The weeds aren't going to pull themselves.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a viral gastroenteritis – a stomach bug, essentially. Or potentially some mild food poisoning, despite your diet. It's also possible, given the recent loss of your husband, that this is related to stress, which can absolutely manifest physically. I'm going to order a stool sample analysis just to rule out any bacterial infections. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Woodring. And I’ll prescribe you a medication to help calm things down – loperamide, an anti-diarrheal. Take it as directed. Hydrate well—lots of fluids. And try to eat bland foods for a few days—rice, toast, bananas… you know, the BRAT diet. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? Fine. But I expect fast results. And the BRAT diet? I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. I'm not a baby. Look, will this medication at least let me leave the house? I have a life, you know. And frankly, I don't appreciate being treated like I'm making this up. It's embarrassing enough to be here, talking about… this. I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The medication should help alleviate the symptoms and allow you to resume your normal activities, yes. As for the stool sample, it's standard procedure. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to rule things out. And I assure you, I am not implying you are "making this up". But I have to cover all bases. I'm writing up the prescription now. You can pick it up at your usual pharmacy. The lab results should be back in a few days. If your symptoms worsen—severe dehydration, high fever, bloody stool—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, I understand. Emergency room. Dehydration. Bloody stool. Wonderful. Just what I needed to hear. Look, can I go now? I really need to get back home. And please don’t call me unless it’s absolutely necessary. I have a garden to tend to. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. Here’s the summary. And please, try to get some rest. Good day, Ms. Woodring. .
