DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh... well, I think it's for a... a check-up. Something about... sports? My ex-wife, she signed me up for something. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. It's a lot to keep track of, you know? I just need to make sure I'm... allowed to do this thing. Whatever this thing is.
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up… related to sports, you said. And your ex-wife arranged it. Okay. Well, let's start with some basics then. Do you happen to know what sport this is for?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I do not. Something with a ball, maybe? Or a bat? I used to play baseball when I was a young man, a long time ago. But this... this is new. She just handed me a paper and said, "Go to this doctor." Women, you know? Always making things complicated. Is it important what kind of sport it is? I'm not sure it matters much to me. As long as I don't pull a muscle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It can be important, Mr. Bartok. Different sports have different physical demands, and we need to make sure you're cleared for whatever activity you'll be doing. Otherwise, you could risk injury. Do you recall anything else about this appointment?
PATIENT: Injury? Oh, no, no injuries. I'm a strong man, still. Well, mostly. I used to be very strong. I helped build houses, you know? For a good many years. But this paper... it just said "physical." That's all I remember. A big word, "physical." Like at school. Is this like when you're a little boy and they check your height? I don't like those things. Always felt silly standing against the wall. I really don't recall any specifics about what she wanted me to do. She just... makes a lot of demands, that woman. Does it matter if I'm not very good at this sport?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, it’s difficult for me to assess your fitness level without knowing what you're trying to be fit for. Let's try a different approach. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm... let me think. My knees, they bother me sometimes. Especially when it's cold. And my back... aches a bit after I lift things. But that's just... getting older, I suppose. Everyone gets older. I don't take any pills, if that's what you mean. Never been one for taking pills. They just make you feel worse, I heard. My ex-wife, she's always trying to get me to see doctors about this and that, but I tell her, “I'm fine, I’m fine!” Is that what you want to know? About pills and aches? It’s just… normal old-man stuff, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Knees and back pain. Okay. And no medications. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything specifically – arthritis, high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Arthritis... that sounds bad. No, I don't think so. The doctor never told me I had that. High blood pressure… I don’t know what that is. Does that mean I get angry easily? Because sometimes that woman… never mind. Diabetes? No, I like sweets sometimes, but I don't think I have that. I'm a regular man, Doctor, not a sick man. Honestly, I think she just likes sending me to doctors to bother her. She's always been a bit... dramatic, you see. I’m pretty sure I’m healthy enough for... whatever this is. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Just to be thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. It will give me a better idea of your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your knees and back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood pressure... oh, alright. If you have to. But don't go poking around too much. And please, be gentle with my knees. They're sensitive. I suppose listening to my heart and lungs is fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a lunch appointment, you see. A friend of mine, he's a good man. He makes a good sandwich. So, quickly now, Doctor. Quickly. Is this going to hurt? I really don't like pain.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't hurt, Mr. Bartok. Just a standard check-up. If you could just lie down on the table, please. And I'll need you to remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here I go. Shoes and socks off... there. It's cold in here, you know. Women always keep these places too cold. And be careful with my feet. They're sensitive, too. Just hurry up, Doctor. Please. This is very uncomfortable. And don't tell me I'm getting old, alright? I'm not that old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Just relax. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit fast. Lungs are clear. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! There! Right there! A little to the left. It's always been a bit sore. Especially when it rains. And don't push so hard! You're going to break something. See? I told you it was sore. Women... you always poke around too much. It's not broken, I assure you. Just a little… wear and tear. From working hard, you understand? Not from sitting around doing nothing, like some people. A little tenderness is normal, Doctor. Normal! Are we almost done? This is really quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I'm just finishing up. Now, can you bend your knees?
PATIENT: Bend my knees? Oh! Oh, dear. That's... not so good. It feels... stiff. And it makes a popping sound. Like... like little bubbles. See? It's not very flexible. Never been very flexible. Always been a bit… solid. Like a rock. You don't expect a rock to bend, do you? It's just… old age, Doctor. Probably old age. This is terrible. What's going to happen to me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. It appears you have some limited range of motion and crepitus in both knees. This could be due to a number of things – arthritis, previous injury, or just general wear and tear. Given your history and the limited information I have about what you're planning to do, I recommend an X-ray of both knees to assess the underlying condition. Additionally, I’d like to refer you to a physical therapist for an evaluation and potential strengthening exercises. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: X-ray? Physical therapist? What for? I just need to know if I can do this… thing. Whatever it is. This sounds like a lot of trouble. And expense, I imagine. My ex-wife is going to love this. She always wants me to spend money on things I don't need. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just… tell me if it's okay? I just want a simple answer. Yes or no. Can I do this sports thing, or can't I? Honestly, this is all very frustrating. I just wanted a quick check-up. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration. However, I cannot provide a definitive answer without more information. I need to know what this "sports thing" entails. And I cannot safely clear you for activity without assessing the underlying cause of your knee pain. An X-ray is a simple imaging test that will help me rule out any significant structural damage. The physical therapist can evaluate your strength and flexibility and develop a plan to help prevent injury. I strongly recommend you follow my advice. Ignoring this pain could lead to a more serious injury. But if you absolutely insist on proceeding without these tests, I will document your refusal in your chart. However, I will not be able to provide medical clearance. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Refusal? Document? This is ridiculous! All this trouble… for something I don't even remember signing up for. Fine! Fine, do the X-ray. And the… physical thing. But if it's expensive, my ex-wife is paying! And if it hurts… I'm blaming you, Doctor. But if you ask me, it's all a waste of time. I just wanted to know if I can play a little… game. Whatever it is. And don't tell me it's my fault for getting old. It's just… life, you understand? Just… get it over with, please. I have a sandwich waiting for me. .
