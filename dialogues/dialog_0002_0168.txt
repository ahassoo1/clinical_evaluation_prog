DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it's rather…delicate. I'm seeing someone, you see, and I thought it best to be thorough. One simply can't be too careful these days, with everything going around.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always good to be proactive about your health. “Thorough” is a great approach. When you say "everything going around," are you referring to any specific concerns, or just general wellness?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Things. Infections, of course. And… other unpleasantness. I simply want to be certain I haven’t contracted anything untoward. He’s…a bit of a free spirit, shall we say? I need reassurance, really. It's not his place to be providing that, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re wanting to rule out any potential sexually transmitted infections, and get a general health check as well. That's very sensible. To start, can you tell me a little more about your relationship with this person?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…recent. A few weeks, perhaps. We met through a mutual acquaintance. He's…charming. Very attentive. Perhaps too attentive, if I’m honest. He’s…a bit younger than myself, naturally. And travels frequently. It’s…complicated. I suppose that’s the word. And I'd rather not delve into the particulars, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you don't need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing it’s a recent relationship and that he travels frequently is helpful. To get a better idea of what tests might be appropriate, can you tell me if you’ve been sexually active with anyone else recently, or if you’ve had any symptoms like unusual discharge, sores, or pain when urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Certainly not. I have always been…discerning. And, no, I have experienced nothing of the sort. Really. I would have known immediately if something were amiss. One doesn't simply ignore such things, Doctor. I maintain a certain standard of hygiene and…awareness. It’s simply a precaution. A thorough one, as I said.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it's smart to be proactive. Since you’re wanting a thorough check, and to give you peace of mind, I’d recommend we do a full STI screening, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. We can also check for herpes if you'd like. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose that sounds…reasonable. Though I do hope it won't be too invasive. I trust you have…discreet facilities? And I must insist on a female technician, naturally. I’m rather particular about…personal boundaries. And herpes…well, one hears such dreadful things. If you feel it’s absolutely necessary, I suppose. But I sincerely doubt it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We have completely private facilities, and I will personally ensure a female technician will be conducting the tests. And I completely respect your boundaries. We'll only do the herpes test if you’re comfortable with it, and it's certainly not required. It's good to know your comfort level. To complete the screening, I’ll also need a urine sample and a small blood sample. Would you be able to provide those for me today?
PATIENT: Blood, you say? Oh, dear. I do dislike needles. But…if it’s necessary. And yes, a urine sample I can manage. Where…where is the restroom? I presume it’s…clean? One does hope so, given the circumstances. And, Doctor, are these tests covered by Medicare? I wouldn't want any unpleasant surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, they are covered by Medicare, so you shouldn’t have any unexpected costs. And absolutely, our facilities are very clean and private. The restroom is just down the hall to your left, and I’ll have a collection cup waiting for you. After you’ve provided your sample, we'll take you to a comfortable room where the blood draw will be done. It’s just a small amount, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. I'll also need to ask you a few standard medical history questions while we wait for the lab results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. History questions…I suppose that’s unavoidable. But do try to be brief, Doctor. My time is…valuable. And please, no unnecessary probing. I have a rather…active social life, and I’m not inclined to discuss the particulars with strangers. Is there anything I should know beforehand? Will this…procedure…cause any discomfort?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will keep the questions concise and focused on what’s medically relevant, and respect your privacy completely. The blood draw might feel a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. There’s minimal discomfort involved. Let’s start with some basics. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and I always get sufficient rest. I have never had any issues with blood pressure, or…those other ailments. My family has excellent genes, you see. My mother lived to be ninety-eight, and she was perfectly capable until the very end. Though she did have a touch of arthritis, if you must know. But that’s hardly relevant, is it? Do you require a list of my dietary supplements? I take a great deal to maintain my vitality.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And no, a list of supplements isn't necessary right now, but if you do start any new ones, it's always good to let me know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. There was that unfortunate incident with my wisdom teeth, years ago. Quite traumatic, actually. And I was briefly hospitalized for observation after a rather nasty bout of the flu in 1998. But other than that, no. I've always been exceptionally healthy, as I said. I pride myself on maintaining a robust immune system. I avoid crowded places, you see. One simply can’t be too careful. It’s…a prudent approach.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And you're very right to be prudent about your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I don’t believe in relying on artificial substances. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A little chamomile tea, perhaps, or a warm compress. I find that proper rest and a healthy diet are far more effective than those…pharmaceutical concoctions. No, Doctor, I assure you, I take absolutely no medications. I wouldn't dream of it. It’s…unsavory, really. Do you need to know what brand of chamomile tea I prefer? It's organic, naturally. From a small, independent vendor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Just wanted to be certain. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Well… I do find that certain perfumes give me a slight headache. And shellfish, no. Simply can't tolerate it. Gives me…indigestion. But other than that, no. I'm exceptionally fortunate in that regard. My skin is rather sensitive, however. So I’m very careful about the soaps and lotions I use. Organic, naturally. And fragrance-free. One simply can’t be too cautious. It’s…a matter of maintaining a certain standard. Are you finished with your questions, Doctor? I’m beginning to feel a touch…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Esthela. As we discussed, we'll proceed with the STI screening, including urine and blood samples. I'll have a nurse come in to assist you with those. The results typically take a few days, and we’ll contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that will be all. Though…do you perhaps have any recommendations for a good facialist? One with a…discreet practice, naturally. And someone who specializes in sensitive skin. I find it terribly difficult to locate someone reputable these days. But other than that…no. Just please, do ensure everything is handled with the utmost…discretion. And do let me know promptly when the results are available. I’d prefer a phone call, naturally. Not an email. And…that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can provide you with a list of highly-rated aestheticians in the area with excellent reputations for discretion and sensitive skin care. I'll have my nurse bring that along with the paperwork for the lab tests. And yes, we will contact you by phone with the results. Nurse Jones will be with you shortly to get everything started. Thank you for choosing our practice, Esthela. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then.
