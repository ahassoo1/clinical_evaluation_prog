DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Nooruddin. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. I understand it has to do with making plans for… well, for if I am unable to make them myself, eventually. Someone suggested I get an… Advance Directive, was it? Or perhaps a POLST form? I confess, the details are rather hazy. I simply want to be prepared, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. An Advance Directive, or a POLST form… Yes, I understand. It’s… responsible of you to think about these things. Though, honestly, at 35, it's a bit premature, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Perhaps. But… things have been… unpredictable. And I would rather be overly prepared than leave things to chance, if you understand. It’s not that I expect anything, but… a friend suggested it, and I trust her judgment. Would you mind explaining what each one is, exactly? I seem to recall something about wishes… and medical care? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, an Advance Directive—it's a legal document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s… quite broad. A POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—that's a more specific medical order, usually for people with serious illnesses. It tells healthcare professionals what treatments you want, or don’t want, right now. Think CPR, ventilation, feeding tubes… It's for when you’re actively sick. Honestly, it sounds like you probably just need the Advance Directive. But before we go any further, let's get a better picture of why you're feeling the need for this now. Is there anything specifically that's triggered this concern?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. It isn’t a single event, precisely. More a… collection of things. I’ve had… periods of illness, nothing diagnosed, really. Just… fatigue, and weakness. And… lapses in memory. Like now, for example. I can’t quite recall details, or… sequences of events. It’s frustrating. And… a recent scare, involving a friend’s father. It made me realize… well, that these things can happen. I suppose I want to ensure my wishes are known, regardless. Is that… sufficient explanation? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, weakness, and memory lapses… Yes, well, those can be caused by many things. Stress, lack of sleep, diet… I’m not trying to minimize your concerns, but sometimes we jump to conclusions. And a friend’s father’s illness… that's certainly concerning for him, but doesn’t necessarily mean it will happen to you. Alright. Let's get some specifics. How long have you been experiencing this fatigue and weakness?
PATIENT: About… six months, perhaps? It started gradually, but has become more pronounced in the last few months. It isn’t constant, but… it’s debilitating when it occurs. And the memory lapses… they are intermittent as well. Small things, mostly. Forgetting appointments, misplacing objects, struggling to recall names. But… they are becoming more frequent. It’s unsettling. I understand you likely encounter these symptoms often, and that they may not be cause for alarm, but… I would feel more at ease knowing what is happening. Perhaps some tests? Before we proceed with the… directive? It feels… premature to discuss wishes when the cause is unknown.
DOCTOR: Tests… Yes, alright. We can do some basic bloodwork to rule out common deficiencies – iron, vitamin D, thyroid function. A basic metabolic panel. It's standard procedure. Honestly, it’s probably just a vitamin deficiency. But fine, we’ll indulge you. Now, before we order anything, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No… not that I recall. I haven’t had many… illnesses, truthfully. A few childhood ailments, nothing serious. A broken arm, when I was younger. But no chronic conditions, no… ongoing treatments. My family… my parents both led relatively healthy lives, as far as I know. No history of… significant disease, or… genetic predispositions. I was… quite active, for many years. Etching is… physically demanding, in its own way. But that was… some time ago. I apologize again for the vagueness. It’s… difficult to recall specifics. Perhaps my previous physician has records? I changed doctors recently.
DOCTOR: Right. Changing doctors… That complicates things. Do you recall why you changed physicians?
PATIENT: It wasn’t… a disagreement, precisely. More… a relocation. My work took me further afield, and my previous physician wasn’t… conveniently located. It was a logistical matter, really. Nothing… personal. It was quite some time ago, now. Perhaps six months? Around the same time the… fatigue began, actually. I apologize, I seem to be rambling. Is this relevant? I simply thought you wished to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, relocation and fatigue around the same time… interesting. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been… cautious about my health. And… etching requires a steady hand, which smoking would undoubtedly compromise. I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. And I… I was divorced several years ago. I live… a rather quiet life, now. Mostly focused on my work. It’s… solitary, by nature. Is that… sufficient information? I realize this is hardly a medical history, but… I assure you, I have generally been in good health. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol, divorced, solitary… So, no major social risk factors. Let’s get back to the fatigue and memory lapses. When you say “memory lapses,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to describe. Not like forgetting a name, precisely. More like… gaps in recollection. I’ll be working, and… suddenly realize I haven’t been concentrating. Minutes, perhaps even hours, will have passed, and I can’t recall what I was doing. Or… I’ll be in conversation, and… lose my train of thought. It’s fleeting, usually. But… increasingly frequent. And… unsettling. I once left the stove on for several hours, completely unaware. Thankfully, nothing happened, but… it was a frightening experience. It’s not a complete loss of memory, just… moments, or periods, of… absence. Is that… clear? It feels… inadequate to describe. It’s like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Leaving the stove on… That is concerning, Ms. Buoniconti. Gaps in recollection, periods of absence… These are not typical symptoms of a simple vitamin deficiency. Before we order a full neurological workup – which we will – I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. Just a few simple questions to get a baseline. It’s standard procedure, given your reported symptoms. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. A… neurological workup? That sounds… serious. But if that’s what is required, then I… I suppose I trust your judgment. A cognitive assessment sounds… sensible. I confess, I’m… rather nervous now. I simply wished to have some peace of mind, but… this feels… increasingly daunting. But yes, please. Let’s proceed with the assessment. I’ll… answer to the best of my ability. Though, I apologize in advance if my… lapses interfere.
DOCTOR: Alright. Don’t worry, it’s a straightforward test. Just answer as honestly as you can. And don't feel pressured. We'll take our time. Here is the Mini-Mental State Examination. Let's begin when you are ready.
PATIENT: Um… August… the second? Is it the second? I… I believe it’s the second. But I… I’m not entirely certain. I apologize. I’m already… struggling.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is August 2nd, yes. No need to apologize. We're just establishing a baseline, as I said. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… a difficult question. It’s… a rural area, isn’t it? A small town… I… I moved here recently. I’m not very familiar with the local… geography. I know I should know, but… it’s on the tip of my tongue. Is it… is it near the mountains? I apologize profusely. This is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, we are in Willow Creek. It is near the mountains. And you've been a resident for six months. This isn’t about being unfamiliar with the “local geography.” I’m going to order a full neurological workup, including an MRI of the brain, and a referral to a neurologist. And I strongly advise you to refrain from driving until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI…? A neurologist…? Yes, I… I understand. Though… honestly, I’m rather frightened. What… what could be wrong? Is it… serious? And… no driving? That will be… incredibly difficult. I… I suppose I have no choice, if that’s what you recommend. But… could you perhaps elaborate? What are you… suspecting? I know you likely can’t offer a diagnosis without further tests, but… even a general idea would be… reassuring. I feel… utterly lost. And vulnerable. And… genuinely frightened.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I'm not going to speculate. It could be a number of things. A tumor, a stroke, early onset dementia… It’s far too early to say, and frankly, speculating will only cause unnecessary anxiety. The tests will give us the answers we need. I’m scheduling the MRI for tomorrow morning. The neurologist, Dr. Ramirez, will contact you to arrange an appointment. I will also have my nurse draw some bloodwork to rule out any basic deficiencies. And, for your safety and the safety of others, I reiterate – no driving until we have further information. Here are the instructions for the MRI. And the neurologist’s contact information. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I… I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Though… what if… what if it’s something serious? What are the… typical treatments? And… the neurologist… is Dr. Ramirez… highly recommended? I… I apologize for being so… frantic. This is all… incredibly overwhelming. And… I don’t have anyone here. No family, no friends… to… to help me through this. I feel… utterly alone. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand this is unsettling, but panicking won’t help. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent neurologist. And as for treatment options… we’ll discuss those after we have the test results. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I have other patients waiting, so I’m going to have to ask you to excuse me. Please, try to remain calm. And remember, we’re doing everything we can to get you the answers you need.
