DOCTOR: Good morning, Criston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my pee. It’s… orange. It started a few days ago. I don’t know why. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, orange urine. That is something to look into. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… dark orange, not like rusty. More… a bright orange, like… maybe a sports drink? And it happens every time I go to the bathroom. I drink a lot of water, I always have, so it’s not from being thirsty. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Bright orange, like a sports drink, and it happens consistently. And you're well-hydrated, so dehydration isn’t likely the cause. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing like that. It feels normal when I pee, just… the color is wrong. I also… I haven’t felt sick or anything. No fever, no stomach problems. Just the orange pee. I hope it’s not something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no other symptoms like fever or stomach upset. That’s good to know. Are you taking any vitamins or medications currently?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my back hurts, I take… ibuprofen. The regular kind, you buy at the store. Not a lot, just when I need it. Oh, and my wife gave me some… something for my energy, a few weeks ago. It was in a little bottle. I don’t remember the name. I stopped taking it after a few days, it didn’t really do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and an energy supplement that you stopped taking a few weeks ago. Do you remember the brand name or anything else about that energy supplement?
PATIENT: No, I’m sorry. She bought it at the… the health food store, I think. It was a small bottle, dark glass. It had a… a picture of a leaf on it, maybe? And it was expensive. She said it was good for… for being tired. I don’t know. I really don’t remember much about it. I just stopped taking it because it didn’t help.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dark glass bottle, purchased at a health food store, with a leaf on the label. It was an energy supplement, and you stopped taking it recently because it wasn’t effective. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get back pain sometimes, like I said. But no… serious things. I went to the doctor a few years ago for a check-up, and everything was okay. They said my blood pressure was a little high, but they said to just watch my salt. That’s it. I don’t have… diabetes or anything. My wife worries about everything, but I’m usually pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional back pain, slightly elevated blood pressure that you're monitoring with your salt intake, but otherwise generally healthy. No history of diabetes or other significant medical conditions. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my father had… heart problems, I think. He died when I was young. And my mother, she has arthritis. That’s about it, really. No one else has… anything serious. We don’t talk about health much. It makes my wife nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father and arthritis in your mother. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when we go to restaurants, but I always say no. She worries a lot. I think she thinks I’ll… swell up or something. But I’m fine. Never had an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Criston. Based on what you’ve told me, the orange urine is the most concerning thing right now. It could be a number of things, but given that you were taking an energy supplement recently, that’s a good place to start. Some supplements can definitely cause changes in urine color. I'd like to do a quick urine test, just to rule out any infection or other problems. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A test sounds good. I just want to know what’s wrong. I don’t like being orange. It’s… embarrassing. So, yes, please. A test is good. Do I… do I have to drink anything special for it?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to drink anything special. It's a simple sample. I’ll give you a cup, and you just need to collect a bit of your urine when you’re able. Then, we'll send it to the lab, and we should have results back within a day or two. I’ll have the nurse come in and show you where the restroom is. While we wait for the results, I'll also take your blood pressure to get a current reading, just to be safe. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Blood pressure and a pee test. Okay. Thank you. I hope it's not something serious. My wife will be very worried. She already is, a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're taking this seriously, and we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on. It's often something minor, but it's always best to check. Let me just quickly note that you're feeling anxious about the situation and your wife's potential worry. I’ll make sure to address that if the results do require further discussion. Nurse, could you come in and assist Criston with a urine sample, please?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I hope it’s nothing bad. It’s just… strange, being orange. It doesn't feel wrong, but it looks wrong.
DOCTOR: It is unusual, and it's perfectly understandable to be concerned. We'll get to the bottom of it. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll have some answers for you soon. Is there anything else on your mind right now, while we wait?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… the orange pee. And my wife. She gets… very anxious. Thank you for listening, Doctor. I feel a little better just talking about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Criston. It’s always good to talk things through. And it’s good that you’re thinking of your wife. I'll do my best to explain everything clearly when we have the results. We'll take it one step at a time.
