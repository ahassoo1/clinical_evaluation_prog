DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. My husband, Reginald, suggested I come. He thinks this… medical marijuana might help with my nerves. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but a woman has to keep the peace, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s good that Reginald is looking out for you, and wanting to find ways to help. So, it sounds like you're considering medical marijuana for some nerve issues?
PATIENT: “Issues” is a rather dramatic term, Doctor. It’s not as if I’m falling apart. It’s just… a general unease. A bit of trembling, mostly when I have to… well, deal with people. You know, the sort you encounter in my line of work. It's hardly debilitating. And frankly, I don't appreciate being made to sound as though I am.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, “issues” was a bit strong of me. My apologies. I just want to understand everything that’s going on, so we can figure out the best approach together. So, a general unease and some trembling, particularly when interacting with others… Could you tell me more about your line of work?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a bailiff, Doctor. Have been for… oh, goodness, nearly fifty years. It's not a glamorous profession, let me assure you. Lots of unpleasant encounters with people who… don't respect the law, or common decency for that matter. It requires a firm hand, which I certainly possess, but lately… it's just been a bit more trying. Reginald says I’ve been… “on edge”. Honestly, I think he just wants me to slow down, but that’s not an option. Someone has to keep things orderly, you know.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly stressful, Ellan. Fifty years is a long time to be in a profession that involves such difficult interactions. It makes perfect sense that it would take a toll. So, this trembling and unease… Has it been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It’s not as if I woke up one morning suddenly unable to perform my duties. It’s been… creeping up on me. Perhaps the last year or so. The people we’re dealing with are… less and less respectful. More… brazen, if you will. It's simply… exhausting. And Reginald insists I'm not sleeping well. I assure you, Doctor, I am sleeping perfectly adequately, but he's a worrier, that man. A complete worrier.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the increased stress at work is definitely a contributing factor, and Reginald's concern is understandable. It's good he's paying attention. Besides the trembling and unease, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Reginald makes lovely meals, but I don’t always finish my plate. And I've been… a bit forgetful, perhaps. Though honestly, at my age, a little forgetfulness is to be expected, isn’t it? It's not as if I’m losing my mind. I remember perfectly well what needs to be done at work, and I certainly haven't misplaced my purse recently. It's just… small things. Like where I put my reading glasses. Or the name of that actress… you know, the one with the blonde hair. Not Marilyn Monroe, though. The other one.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some forgetfulness. It's good you're aware of those changes. And it is perfectly normal to experience some memory lapses as we get older. I want to get a good picture of everything, so we can figure out what’s going on. Have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling more sad or anxious than usual?
PATIENT: Anxious? Well, I wouldn’t say anxious. Irritated, perhaps. There’s a great deal of foolishness in the world, Doctor, and it does tend to get on one’s nerves. Sad? No. I have a good life. A comfortable home, a devoted husband, and a job that, while occasionally frustrating, is… necessary. I wouldn't say I'm sad. Just… weary. Extremely weary. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather intrusive. I came here to discuss medical marijuana, not to have my emotional state dissected.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to say that, Ellan, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I’m just trying to rule out any other potential causes for what you’re experiencing, and to make sure we consider all aspects of your health. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and respected. We can definitely focus on the medical marijuana if you prefer, but understanding the whole picture helps me provide the best care. Before we discuss that further, would you mind if I asked a few quick questions about your medical history – any previous illnesses, surgeries, or medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t been seriously ill in… oh, goodness, decades. A touch of the flu now and then, a bit of arthritis in my knees, but nothing that requires constant medical attention. No surgeries. And I don’t take any medications. I believe in a good, healthy diet and a strong constitution. Reginald tries to get me to take something for my blood pressure, but I refuse. All those chemicals… I prefer to rely on natural remedies, if possible. And frankly, I think a nice cup of chamomile tea is far more effective than any pill.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant medical history, no surgeries, no medications… and you prefer natural remedies. That’s helpful. Are you allergic to anything – any foods, medications, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. Reginald is always fussing about dust mites and pollen, but I pay him no mind. A little dust never hurt anyone. And I’ve been around flowers my entire life. Dominican women are a hardy bunch, Doctor. We don't succumb to such trivialities. Frankly, I find this entire process rather… unnecessary. You're asking me about allergies now? Is that really relevant to medical marijuana?
DOCTOR: You're right to question that, Ellan, and I apologize if I’m belaboring the point. It’s standard practice to rule out potential allergic reactions to any substance, even natural ones, before recommending a new treatment. It’s a precaution. Now, regarding the medical marijuana, what specifically were you hoping it would help with?
PATIENT: Well, Reginald said it might calm my nerves. He read something online, I believe. About how it helps with anxiety and… I don’t know, what was the other thing? Sleep. Yes, he thinks it might help me sleep. Honestly, I sleep perfectly well, but I’m willing to try something if it keeps him happy. He’s a good man, Reginald, but he does tend to worry. So, if this… marijuana will quiet his mind, then I suppose it's worth a try. Just don't expect miracles, Doctor. I am not a fragile flower.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re mainly considering it to ease Reginald’s concerns and perhaps see if it can take the edge off. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before we proceed, I want to explain a few things about medical marijuana, and then we can discuss if it's the right option for you. First, it’s important to know that there are different strains of marijuana, each with different effects. Some are more relaxing, others are more energizing. And the method of delivery – smoking, vaping, edibles – also affects how it works. Do you have any preferences in that regard?
PATIENT: Preferences? Heavens, no. I know absolutely nothing about it. Reginald mentioned something about oils, I think. He said they're less… unpleasant than smoking. Honestly, the thought of smoking anything is rather appalling. I’ve never been a smoker. So, if there’s an option that doesn't involve inhaling fumes, that would be preferable. Oils sound… acceptable, I suppose. As long as they don’t taste dreadful. And I certainly don't want anything that will impair my judgment. I have a job to do, you know. Someone has to keep things orderly.
DOCTOR: Oils are a good option then. They're a discreet and convenient way to consume marijuana, and they avoid the risks associated with smoking. The dosage can also be more easily controlled. Now, before we consider a prescription, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline and rule out any other underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't had a proper physical in… well, decades. I feel perfectly fine. But… I suppose if you insist. It's hardly ideal, but I don’t want to appear uncooperative. Just be quick about it, please. And I would appreciate it if you could explain what you're doing as you go along. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain everything as I go along, and we’ll take it at your pace. It will be a standard exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief neurological assessment. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, I told Reginald this was unnecessary. I feel perfectly healthy. A little weary, perhaps, but that’s just from dealing with… well, you know. The sort of people one encounters in my profession. It’s hardly a cause for medical alarm. Are you finished with the listening yet? It’s rather… invasive.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ellan. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and balance. It’s a quick assessment to see how your nervous system is functioning. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table?
PATIENT: Balance? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been standing on my feet for fifty years. I think my balance is perfectly adequate. But very well, proceed with your… assessment. Just don’t expect me to perform any acrobatic feats. I am a bailiff, not a gymnast.
DOCTOR: Okay, please follow my finger with your eyes… good. Now, I’m going to gently tap your knees with this hammer. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. No concerns there. And your balance is steady. Overall, the exam is unremarkable. Your vital signs are stable, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your neurological function is within normal limits. The diminished reflexes are likely age-related. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I think it's reasonable to explore medical marijuana as a potential option to help manage your anxiety and improve your sleep, as long as you’re comfortable with it. However, I do have a few concerns. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and we'll want to monitor that closely. And…
PATIENT: Monitor? What exactly do you mean by “monitor”? Am I going to have to come back here frequently for… tests? Because honestly, Doctor, I haven't got time for that. I have a job to do. And frankly, I don’t appreciate the implication that I’m falling apart. I came here for a simple certification, not a lifetime commitment to medical scrutiny. Perhaps I should just forget the whole thing. Reginald can find someone else to worry about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ellan, and I apologize if I’ve given you the impression that I think you're falling apart. That’s not at all what I meant. “Monitor” simply means we'll check your blood pressure periodically to ensure it doesn't increase significantly. Perhaps a quick check at your primary care physician's office every few months would suffice. I’m not suggesting a lifetime commitment to medical scrutiny, just a reasonable precaution. It's important to be aware of any potential side effects, and to adjust the dosage accordingly. Now, if you’re willing to proceed, I can write you a certification for medical marijuana. But I do want you to understand that it’s not a cure-all, and it may not be the right solution for you. We can start with a low dosage and see how you respond. And I recommend discussing it with Reginald and making sure he understands the potential risks and benefits as well. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable. Yes, that sounds… reasonable. As long as I don’t have to come back here repeatedly for tests. And as long as Reginald promises not to fuss over me constantly. Honestly, I feel as though I’m being treated like a fragile porcelain doll. Very well, Doctor. Write your… certification. But I'm warning you, if this doesn't calm my nerves and allow me to perform my duties, I'll be most displeased. And I’ll be sure to let Reginald know that it was a complete waste of time. Now, let’s get this over with. I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm writing the certification now, and I'll include some information about appropriate dosages and potential side effects. I'll also recommend that you start with a low dosage and gradually increase it as needed. Here you are. This is your medical marijuana certification. Please take it to a licensed dispensary, and they can help you find a suitable product. And remember, if you experience any concerning side effects, or if your symptoms worsen, please consult with your primary care physician. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: A dispensary? Honestly, the thought of going to some… shop to purchase marijuana sounds rather dubious. But very well. I’ll take this to Reginald. He seems to know more about these things. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any further questions. Just… don’t expect me to come back here singing your praises. And tell Reginald to keep his fussing to a minimum. Thank you for your… assistance. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
