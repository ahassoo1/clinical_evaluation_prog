DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe… it’s regarding some surgery I’m hoping to have? It was scheduled, and this is… a check-up beforehand, I think? Honestly, things have been a little… hazy lately. I apologize if I seem confused.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright if things are a little unclear. Pre-operative check-ups can sometimes feel like a lot to keep track of. Let me just pull up your file here… Ah, yes. I see you’re scheduled for a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – on August 15th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds right. A… a cholecystectomy. My gallbladder, yes. I… I remember having some discomfort, and then talking about removing it. It’s all a bit fragmented, if you don’t mind. I do have insurance, private, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mackenzi. We'll take things at your pace. Knowing you have private insurance is helpful, thank you. To get a better picture of things before the surgery, could you tell me a little more about the discomfort you were experiencing?
PATIENT: It was… mostly in my upper abdomen, on the right side. A sort of… ache, really. Not sharp, but persistent. It would come and go, but seemed to get worse after… after eating, I think. Fatty foods, perhaps? I’m terribly sorry, I wish I could be more precise. It was some time ago now, and… well, as I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do recall being quite tired as well, though I don’t know if that was related.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. We'll piece things together. Upper right abdominal pain that worsens with fatty foods is certainly consistent with gallbladder issues. Fatigue can often accompany chronic pain as well. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements – perhaps darker stools or lighter colored urine – along with the pain?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, I believe I did feel nauseous a few times. Not terribly sick, just… unwell. I don’t recall vomiting, thankfully. And… yes! The stools… they were a bit paler than usual, I think. I hadn't really connected that at the time. Lighter colored urine… I don't specifically remember that, but I wasn't paying much attention to that, I suppose. Am I making sense? Is this… helpful?
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Mackenzi. That information is definitely useful. Pale stools and dark urine can sometimes indicate a blockage in the bile duct, which can occur with gallbladder problems. Let me just take a quick look at your recent lab results from when the surgery was scheduled… Okay, I see some slightly elevated liver enzymes here, which can also be associated with gallbladder issues. To get a clearer picture of your overall health before the procedure, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I was widowed a few years ago, and… that was quite difficult, to be honest. It took a toll on my health. Other than that… I haven’t had any major illnesses, as far as I know. No diabetes, no heart problems… I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally something for… for aches and pains, over-the-counter. Nothing prescribed regularly. I had a small surgery years ago to remove my wisdom teeth, but that was uncomplicated. Is there anything specific you are looking for? I’m afraid my medical history isn't very exciting.
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful, Mackenzi. Knowing you haven't had any significant medical issues is good. And it's perfectly alright if your medical history isn't "exciting," as you put it. Just to be thorough, are there any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I'm aware. No food allergies, no allergies to medications… nothing I can recall, at least. I've been fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I do use a lavender scented lotion, and sometimes a bit of perfume, but I haven’t ever had any issues with those. I truly don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Alright, Mackenzi. Just to complete the picture before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Nothing too invasive, just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed. I hope I'm not being too difficult with my… hazy recollections.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi. You’re not being difficult at all. Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay, and how about here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but definitely tender. It’s… a dull ache, more than anything. It feels… familiar, unfortunately. Is that what you expected? I apologize for being such a… complicated patient.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant is consistent with gallbladder inflammation. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is drastically wrong, but it’s important to note. No guarding, no rebound tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen is otherwise soft. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Okay, Mackenzi. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you’re still experiencing symptoms consistent with cholecystitis – inflammation of the gallbladder. The slight tenderness in your upper right quadrant confirms that. The lab results from when the surgery was scheduled also support this. Given your symptoms, and the fact that the surgery is already scheduled, I think proceeding with the cholecystectomy is the right course of action. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. I was worried I was being difficult, or that something was terribly wrong. Knowing that proceeding with the surgery is the right course of action is… reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. Are there any preparations I should be making? Or anything I should be aware of before the procedure?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s good to hear you’re feeling reassured. Yes, there are a few things. Firstly, you should avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight the night before your surgery. Secondly, please arrange for someone to drive you to and from the hospital, as you won't be able to drive yourself after anesthesia. I’m giving you a document here with detailed pre-operative instructions, including what medications to avoid and what to expect on the day of surgery. Please read it carefully. It's important to let the surgical team know if you have any allergies to latex or any other medical conditions. Also, please bring a list of your medications with you. We'll discuss the surgery itself in more detail on the day of the procedure. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you. This is very helpful. No, I don't think so. You've covered everything quite thoroughly, actually. I appreciate you being so patient with me and my… fragmented recollections. It's a relief to know I'm in good hands. I believe that's all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. If you have any questions or concerns before the surgery, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to support you. We'll see you on August 15th. Have a good day, and try to rest.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. I will. Have a wonderful day as well.
