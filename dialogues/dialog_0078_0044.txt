DOCTOR: Good morning, Calin. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I received a letter about being checked to see if I qualify for some home health services. I’m… hoping I do, to be honest. It’s a little complicated, but I’m trying to figure out what my options are.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Calin. We'll certainly explore those options together. The letter you received is part of a program to see if additional support at home would be beneficial. To get a better understanding of your needs, could you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on that makes you think home health services might be helpful?
PATIENT: Well… it’s my work, mostly. I’m a presser, you know, for clothes? It’s… physically demanding, and I’ve been finding it harder and harder to keep up. My back and my hands… they just aren’t what they used to be. And honestly, I’m divorced, and I don’t have much family nearby to help. It’s getting…lonely, trying to manage everything on my own. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Calin. It sounds like you’re carrying a lot, both physically with your job and emotionally with managing things on your own. We're here to help lighten that load. Let's talk a little more about this difficulty with your work. When did you start noticing these issues with your back and hands?
PATIENT: Hmm… it didn’t happen all at once. Maybe… about six months ago? I started noticing little aches after a long day, but I just thought it was normal. But then it started getting worse, and the aches became more constant. Now, even after a good night’s sleep, my hands are stiff and my back feels… tight. It’s interfering with my work, because I can’t press as many clothes in a day. And that… well, that affects my income, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, about six months ago, gradual onset of aches in your back and hands. Constant aches now, and interfering with your work. That's helpful to know. Are there any specific movements or times of day that make the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well… definitely worse after a full shift at work. Standing for long periods, reaching, and especially when I’m using the pressing iron. That puts a lot of strain on my wrists and hands. It’s better when I can sit down and rest, or if I try to take frequent breaks, but… sometimes it’s hard to do that, you know? Especially when I’m trying to meet a deadline. And in the mornings… it’s usually the worst then, stiff and achy. It takes a while for it to loosen up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with standing, reaching, and using the pressing iron. Better with sitting and rest, but difficult to do at times. Worst in the mornings, stiff and achy. That paints a clearer picture. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really pain related, but I’ve been… more tired lately. Just generally feeling worn out, even when I get enough sleep. And… My hands sometimes feel a little numb, especially in my fingertips. It doesn’t last long, just comes and goes. I thought it was maybe from the heat of the iron, or from holding things so tightly. But it’s been happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and intermittent numbness in your fingertips. It's good you’re mentioning these things. That’s important information. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s a good question. It’s not like I can’t use my hands, but… I do drop things more often now. And it’s harder to grip things tightly. Like, opening jars, or carrying heavy bags… I have to be more careful. It’s subtle, but… it’s definitely not as easy as it used to be. It’s just frustrating, you know? It feels like my body is… slowing down.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Calin. It sounds like you’re experiencing a gradual decline in your hand strength and grip, along with fatigue and numbness. That’s certainly concerning, and it's good we’re talking about it. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, diabetes, or carpal tunnel syndrome?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. My mother had some arthritis in her hands when she got older, but I’ve never really had any problems like that myself. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while, honestly. It’s mostly been just managing things on my own. That’s why I’m here now, I suppose. To see if there’s something going on that needs attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I've been lucky, I suppose. Nothing like that. Just the usual childhood illnesses when I was a little girl. Nothing serious enough to require surgery or a hospital stay. I've always tried to stay healthy, but… lately, it feels like my body is starting to betray me.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve generally been very healthy, and that’s wonderful. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like arthritis, diabetes, heart disease, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother, like I said, had arthritis in her hands towards the end of her life. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And he had some heart problems later on. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she had diabetes, I believe. But other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My family wasn’t really ones for talking about that kind of thing. It was just… not discussed. So, it’s hard to say for sure if there's anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, high blood pressure, and diabetes in the family. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… what exactly do you mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I don’t drink alcohol, and definitely no drugs. I try to live a clean life, you know? I believe in taking care of my health. I used to be more active, before my work started taking a toll on my body. I used to enjoy gardening and dancing, but now… I mostly just work and try to rest when I can.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… occasionally, I’ll take some over-the-counter pain relievers when my back is really bothering me. Like ibuprofen, or something like that. But that’s it. I don’t take any regular medications, or vitamins, or anything like that. I try to avoid them if I can. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen use. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to any medications, foods, or anything like that. I don't have any known allergies. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and haven’t had any problems. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Calin, thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I’m hoping we can figure out what’s causing all this, and maybe find a way to get me feeling better.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to examine your hands and wrists, and check your range of motion and strength. Finally, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m a little nervous, but I’m trusting you to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Calin, I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment. Relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 130/85, a little elevated but not significantly concerning. Let's check your pulse now. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, normal. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also normal. Now, let’s examine your hands. Can you open and close your hands for me?
PATIENT: There… like that? It’s a little stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. It’s not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some mild tenderness on both wrists when I palpate them. And I notice some slight swelling on the dorsal side of your left wrist. Now, can you make a fist, and then extend your fingers?
PATIENT: There… like that? It’s a little uncomfortable, you know? Especially on this side. It feels…tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There is some limitation in the range of motion of your left wrist, particularly with extension. And your grip strength is slightly weaker on the left hand compared to the right. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. No pain there. No, that’s okay too. It’s a little tender sometimes, but not right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Calin. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam, I'm noting tenderness and slight swelling in both wrists, some limitation in the range of motion of your left wrist, and slightly reduced grip strength on the left hand. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is mildly tender. These findings, combined with your symptoms of pain, stiffness, fatigue, and intermittent numbness, suggest possible tendinitis, or early signs of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as arthritis, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, ESR , and CRP . I also recommend an X-ray of both wrists to assess the bones and joints. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tendinitis… or carpal tunnel… That sounds… serious. Blood tests and an X-ray… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, and what can be done to help. I’m starting to get worried, to be honest. Will the tests take long? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Calin. It’s good we're getting to the bottom of this. Tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome are both common conditions, and with proper treatment, they can often be managed effectively. The blood tests are relatively quick and involve a simple blood draw. There might be a slight pinch when the needle goes in, but it shouldn’t be painful. The X-ray is also painless and involves no radiation exposure. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend you try to rest your hands as much as possible. Avoid activities that aggravate your symptoms, and consider wearing a wrist splint, especially at night, to help support your wrists. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help reduce inflammation and pain. We'll review the test results as soon as they're available, and then we can discuss the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Rest my hands… a wrist splint… yes, that sounds… manageable. Ibuprofen… I’ve been taking that already, sometimes. A few days… that feels like a long time, but I understand. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. What happens next? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And… how do I go about getting the tests done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Calin. I'm glad I could help. Yes, we’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to review the test results, which I'm thinking in about a week. We can do that now before you leave, if you'd like. As for the tests, I'll write you a lab order for the blood work and an order for the X-rays. The lab is located just down the street here in the building, and the radiology center is across the parking lot. You can go at your convenience, and you don’t need an appointment. Just bring your insurance card and the lab orders, and they'll take care of the rest. Do you have any questions about any of that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Just down the street… and across the parking lot… that’s good. Easy enough. Insurance card… yes, I have that. And the wrist splint… can I get that here, or do I need to go somewhere else? I don’t want to make any more trips than I have to. And… will the tests be expensive? I don’t have insurance, and I’m worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Calin. I completely understand your concern about the cost, especially without insurance. Let me see what I can do. I can write you a prescription for a wrist splint, and our medical assistant can help you find a local pharmacy that offers affordable options. We also have a financial assistance program here at the clinic that might be able to help cover the cost of the tests. Let me have you speak to our medical assistant, Maria, after our appointment, and she can provide you with more information. She’s very helpful. As for the estimated cost of the tests, a basic blood panel like the one I’m ordering usually runs around $100-$150, and an X-ray of both wrists is typically around $50-$100. However, prices can vary, so it's best to call the lab and radiology center beforehand to get a more accurate quote. Does that help ease some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that helps a lot, Doctor. Knowing there’s a financial assistance program… and that Maria can help… that’s a huge relief. And getting a quote beforehand… that’s smart. Okay. So, I’ll talk to Maria after our appointment. And I’ll call the lab and radiology center to get a quote. And then schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind, and very patient. I really appreciate it. It's just… it’s been a stressful few months, and I’m glad I finally came in to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Calin. I’m glad I could help. It takes courage to come in and get things checked out, and I commend you for doing so. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Let’s go ahead and get that lab order and prescription written up for you, and then we can schedule your follow-up appointment. Maria will be happy to assist you with the financial assistance information and to answer any other questions you may have. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I really appreciate it. I’m starting to feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, and having a plan. I’m ready to get the tests done and figure out what’s next. Let’s get that lab order and prescription. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's the best attitude to have, Calin. I'm confident we'll get to the bottom of this together. Here you go. This is your lab order and prescription for the wrist splint. Maria is right outside the door, she’ll be happy to help you with scheduling and answer any questions you have. It was a pleasure meeting you, Calin. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again next week. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Solero. You too. I appreciate everything. .
