DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I understand you are Dr. Andraca. I am here today… well, my niece, she thinks I should get checked out before I move into one of those senior living places. Just to make sure everything is alright, you understand. She worries so. I’m Lennie Tkac, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lennie Tkac. I see. That’s very thoughtful of your niece – it’s always good to have a check-up before a big life change like that. We'll do a thorough assessment to give you both peace of mind. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about why you felt a check-up might be a good idea, or have you been experiencing any particular symptoms that have you concerned?
PATIENT: Well, symptoms… not exactly. I feel… my age, naturally. A little slower than I used to be, perhaps. And my memory… isn’t what it once was, though I can recall things from seventy years ago perfectly clear, it’s the recent things that slip my mind sometimes. But nothing that keeps me from my baking, thankfully! I still make the best frybread you ever tasted. It’s just… she worries, you see. And a good report would set her mind at ease.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you're still enjoying your baking! Frybread sounds delicious. It’s very kind of you to think of your niece, and it's good that you’re proactive about your health. So, the slowing down and some memory issues… those are certainly things we can look at. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The slowing down… that’s been gradual, over the last few years, I suppose. Maybe five years or so? It’s not a sudden thing, just… less energy, you know? I used to be able to bake all day without a second thought. Now, I need a little rest in between batches. The memory… that’s harder to say. It comes and goes. Some days I’m as sharp as a tack, other days… I forget where I put my glasses, even though they’re on my head! It’s mostly little things, I suppose. Nothing that interferes with my work, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual slowing down over five years, and memory issues that come and go, mostly little things. That gives me a good starting point. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… yes, actually. It isn't that I don't want to eat, it’s just… smaller portions, I suppose. I used to have a hearty appetite, could eat a whole roast chicken myself! Now, I get full quicker. I haven't weighed myself in a while, but I reckon I’ve lost a few pounds. Nothing drastic, mind you. My clothes still fit, mostly. It’s probably just getting older, you know. Less activity, less appetite.
DOCTOR: It could very well be related to age and activity level, but we want to rule out anything else that might be contributing. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about other areas of your health. Have you been experiencing any changes in your sleep patterns – are you sleeping more or less than usual?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, that's another thing. I don't sleep less, exactly, but it’s not as restful as it used to be. I wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I’m just… thinking. Other times, I can’t quite put my finger on it. I used to sleep soundly through anything. Now, a little noise can wake me right up. And I don’t always feel refreshed in the morning, even if I’ve been in bed for eight hours. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Difficulty with restful sleep and waking up frequently are both important things to note. Now, let's talk about any other health concerns you might have. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body – any joint pain, back pain, or anything else?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. My joints ache a little sometimes, especially in the mornings. My knees, mostly. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. I’ve lived a long life, you see. Worked hard, been on my feet a lot. It's to be expected, I suppose. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers when it gets bad, and that usually helps. Nothing constant, though. It doesn't keep me from my work. And my back… occasionally a little twinge, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, some occasional joint and back pain, managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me about that… oh, maybe twenty years ago? I take a little pill for it every day. Keeps it under control, thankfully. Everything else… no, not that I recall. I've been fortunate, all things considered. I’ve never had any major surgeries or anything like that. A few broken bones when I was a boy, running around like a wild Indian, but they healed up just fine. And the occasional cold, of course, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. You've been managing high blood pressure for about twenty years. Good. And you haven't had any major surgeries or broken bones as an adult. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, it says here. That’s all. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, either. I always figured good food and a little exercise were enough. Though my niece keeps trying to get me to take something for my memory… but I told her I'm fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the Lisinopril. And no vitamins or supplements. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things. I've never had any trouble with pollen or dust, either. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors, you see. A Lakota man has to be tough. No allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a long story. My parents… they lived long lives, both of them. My mother died when she was in her eighties, my father a little earlier. They didn't have much in the way of medical care, you see. We were… simple people. As for illnesses… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he had something with his heart, I think. And my aunt… she had diabetes. But other than that… not much that I recall. Most of my family… they just wore out, you know? Living a hard life will do that to you.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heart issues in your grandfather and diabetes in your aunt. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never. A Lakota man respects the land, respects his body. Smoking never appealed to me. My father didn't smoke, my grandfather didn't smoke… it wasn't something we did. No, never smoked a day in my life. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. A little beer with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: Social situation…? Well, I live alone. Always have. I enjoy my own company. I have a niece, she checks on me regularly, makes sure I’m alright. And I have a few friends from the reservation, we get together sometimes for coffee and conversation. But mostly, I keep to myself. I enjoy baking, you see. It’s a good life. Quiet, peaceful. I don’t need much. I spend a lot of time thinking about the old ways, remembering my ancestors. It’s a good way to live. Not lonely, mind you. Just… content.
DOCTOR: That sounds very fulfilling, Mr. Tkac. It's good to have a sense of peace and contentment. Alright, that gives me a very good overview of your health history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m sure you’ll find plenty to look at. Go ahead, then. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/88. It’s not critically high, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on, given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. It’s not a major concern at this point, but we may want to consider an echocardiogram to get a better look. Your lungs sound clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your pulse in your wrists and feet. Pulses are a little weak in your feet, but palpable. Now, let's do a quick neurological assessment. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Your eye movements are good. Now, I'm going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Your grip strength is good on both sides. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Overall, the exam is relatively normal, but there are a few things we should investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work and a urine sample. We should also discuss a possible echocardiogram. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A little elevated blood pressure, a murmur… not surprising, I suppose. I am an old man. And the weak pulses… I have always had poor circulation. Blood work and a urine sample, an echocardiogram… yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem to know what you're doing. Just let me know if you find anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Tkac. I appreciate that. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health, including your kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. The urine sample will help us rule out any infection or other abnormalities. And the echocardiogram will give us a detailed look at your heart and help us determine the cause of the murmur. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and collect a urine sample. We can schedule the echocardiogram for next week, if that works for you. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I haven't bothered with one of those. I haven't paid much attention to my blood pressure, to be honest. My niece is always telling me I should, but… I always put it off. Perhaps I should have listened to her. If you think it's important, I suppose I can get one. Where would I even find such a thing?
DOCTOR: It’s not a matter of blame, Mr. Tkac. It’s good you’re addressing it now. A home blood pressure cuff is relatively inexpensive and easy to use. You can find them at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even Walmart. I can write you a prescription for one if your insurance covers it, or you can purchase one over the counter. We can also have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave today. It’s important to take it at the same time each day, and to keep a log of your readings so we can track your progress. In the meantime, let's focus on the blood work and echocardiogram. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and collect the urine sample now, and then we can schedule the echocardiogram before you leave. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfect. A prescription for the cuff would be helpful, if my insurance covers it. And showing me how to use it… that would be much appreciated. I’m not very good with these modern contraptions, you see. Blood work, urine sample, the cuff… and the echo-thing. Yes, let’s get it done. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. And thank you for being so patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It’s my pleasure. I'll write you that prescription for the blood pressure cuff now, and I'll ask the nurse to come in and draw your blood and collect a urine sample. She’ll also show you how to use the cuff and explain the importance of monitoring your blood pressure at home. I'll be back in a few minutes to discuss the next steps, including scheduling the echocardiogram. In the meantime, just relax, and let me know if you have any questions. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will wait here patiently.
DOCTOR: "Hi Mr. Tkac, I'm going to draw a few tubes of blood for the lab tests, and then collect a urine sample. Do you have a recent list of all medications and allergies?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, young lady. Just the one medication, Lisinopril, for my blood pressure. And no allergies, as far as I know. I’ve never had any trouble with anything, thankfully. I’ll tell you what, though, my niece would probably have a list of things I should be taking, if you’re interested. But I haven't taken any of them.
DOCTOR: "That’s good to know, Mr. Tkac. Lisinopril only, no known allergies. And don’t worry, we’ll just focus on what you are taking today. Okay, if you could just relax your arm for me, and we’ll get this over with quickly." "This might feel a little pinch, but it shouldn't be too bad." “Alright, almost done… just a few more tubes.” “Okay, all done! Now, for the urine sample. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll give you a few moments of privacy to collect it. Just make sure to label it with your name and date of birth. I'll be right outside when you’re finished."
PATIENT: “Here you are, young lady. All done.”
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Mr. Tkac. You did great! Now, let me get these samples sent off to the lab, and I’ll let Dr. Andraca know they’re ready. He’ll be back in a few minutes to discuss the next steps.” “Alright, Mr. Tkac, the blood work and urine sample have been sent to the lab. The results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, we can schedule an echocardiogram to get a closer look at your heart. Would next Tuesday or Wednesday work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday would be fine, Doctor. No particular commitments on that day. Wednesday would work as well, if Tuesday doesn’t suit your schedule. Just let me know what’s best for you. It’s not a great rush, you see. I’ve lived a long life already. But I appreciate you looking into it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday works perfectly. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you now. It should take about 30-45 minutes. They’ll likely ask you to refrain from caffeine on the day of the test. Now, as we discussed, I’m also prescribing a home blood pressure cuff. Do you have any questions about using it, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything quite thoroughly. The cuff… I'm sure I can manage it. The nurse seems a capable young lady, and you've explained it all very clearly. No, I don't have any questions at this time. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so patient with an old man, and for taking the time to look after me. I appreciate it more than you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It's my pleasure. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns at all, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. I'll have the receptionist let you know when your echocardiogram is scheduled. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and we’ll see you next Tuesday. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, Mr. Tkac.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. Have a good day to you too, Doctor.
