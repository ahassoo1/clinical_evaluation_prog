DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it's about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on and on about how it would help my arthritis. I’m not one to jump on bandwagons, you understand, but she’s quite insistent. I thought I’d see if getting some sort of… permission… from a doctor would be possible. It just seems rather… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Unconventional is one word for it, yes. I understand your daughter is encouraging you to try medical marijuana for your arthritis. And you’re looking for… my opinion, essentially?
PATIENT: Precisely. Opinion, and a… a piece of paper, if it comes to that. I wouldn't want to do anything… improper. Though, frankly, I’ve never even seen anyone use the stuff, let alone considered it for myself. It's just… she says it doesn't feel like taking pills, and I do get tired of those pills. But I wouldn't want to become… dependent, you see? It's a delicate matter.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s approach this systematically. First, tell me a bit more about this arthritis. Where exactly are you experiencing pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, mostly in my hands, you see. Both of them. Makes it terribly difficult to do my work. I’m a bailiff, you know. Always having to grip things, open doors, that sort of thing. And my knees, they ache something awful, especially when the weather changes. Honestly, they feel like they’re filled with gravel. It’s a nuisance, a constant nuisance. I’ve had it for… oh, must be twenty years now, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Twenty years. Alright. And what about the pills you’re currently taking for this pain?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Dr. Abernathy prescribed me something. A white pill, I believe. And sometimes I take ibuprofen, the over-the-counter kind, when it’s really bad. The white pills… they help, a little. But they make me rather drowsy, and sometimes my stomach doesn't agree with them. It’s a trade-off, you understand. Pain or feeling… sluggish. Not a pleasant choice either way. Honestly, I can barely recall the name of the pill. Everything just blurs together after a while, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Let’s try to get that clarified. Do you happen to remember anything else about the doctor who prescribed it?
PATIENT: Dr. Abernathy… Hmm. He was at St. Jude’s, I believe. A very young man, quite polite. He was new when I started seeing him. This was… oh, five or six years ago, perhaps? He had a lot of diplomas on the wall. A very modern office, all glass and steel. He mostly just talked about… inflammation, I think. And told me to avoid red meat. Honestly, I barely listened. Doctors always say the same things, don’t they? It's all a bit of a blur. I just wanted something for the pain, and he gave me the pills. That’s all I really recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm attempting to pull your records from St. Jude’s. It can take a moment. In the meantime, let’s talk about other medical conditions. Do you have any problems with your heart, lungs, or kidneys?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I've always been quite healthy, actually. Never been one for complaining. My heart's been perfectly fine, as far as the doctors can tell. Lungs are good, I don't smoke, you see. And kidneys… well, I haven't had any trouble with those, thank the Lord. I do have a bit of trouble with my eyesight, that’s why I wear these glasses, but that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? Mostly just getting old, I suppose. I’ve always been very careful about what I eat, and I get plenty of exercise, even with this arthritis. It’s a nuisance, but it doesn't define me, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Years ago, when I was still living in the Dominican Republic, I had my tonsils taken out. A very quick procedure, they said. And… and I had a cataract removed from my left eye about ten years ago. That was… unpleasant, but it fixed my vision wonderfully. Other than those two… no, nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises, I suppose. Nothing that would concern a doctor, I’m sure. Honestly, I'm rather proud of my constitution. I've always been a strong woman. It’s just this arthritis that’s… wearing me down a bit lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, nothing serious. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen, you see, during the spring. And sometimes my skin gets itchy if I use certain soaps. But nothing life-threatening, nothing that requires an EpiPen. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. My daughter, though… she's allergic to everything under the sun. Peanuts, shellfish, cats, dust… you name it. It's a constant worry for her, honestly. But me? Just a bit of a sniffle and an itch now and then. Hardly worth mentioning, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Rannells. I’ve located your records from St. Jude’s. It appears you’re currently prescribed naproxen 500mg twice daily for osteoarthritis. Is that the white pill you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh! Naproxen… Yes, yes, that’s it! Naproxen. See? I knew I'd remember eventually. And yes, that’s the white pill. My daughter will be so pleased I remembered something. Honestly, I get so muddled sometimes. It's good to have that clarified. Makes me feel… less foolish, you understand? So, does that… change things? With the medical marijuana, I mean?
DOCTOR: It does, in the sense that we now have a clearer understanding of your current medication regimen. Now, regarding medical marijuana… While it is becoming more accepted, its use for osteoarthritis is still considered experimental. There is limited high-quality evidence to support its effectiveness, and it’s important to be aware of potential risks and side effects. I’m not comfortable prescribing it without a thorough discussion of these factors, and frankly, given your current medication and age, I have some reservations.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Experimental… reservations… Well, that’s… disappointing. I hadn’t realised it was quite so… complicated. My daughter made it sound so simple. Just a little cream or something, she said. To rub on my hands. She’s always reading those articles online, you see. Perhaps she didn't fully explain the… intricacies. I suppose I shouldn’t have gotten my hopes up. It just seemed like a… gentler alternative. But if you advise against it, Doctor, I trust your judgement. I certainly don’t want to do anything foolish. Perhaps we should just stick with the naproxen, then? Though, as I said, it does make me drowsy…
DOCTOR: Sticking with the naproxen is certainly an option. However, the drowsiness is a significant side effect. We could explore alternative NSAIDs with a different side effect profile, or consider other pain management strategies, such as physical therapy or injections. Before we do anything drastic, let's review your current dosage of naproxen. Are you taking it as prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I try to. Twice a day, as you said. But sometimes… sometimes I forget. Or I’ll take it a little later than I should. I get distracted easily, you see. My husband, bless his heart, he reminds me sometimes. But he’s not always around. It's not that I intentionally skip doses, it's just… life gets in the way. And honestly, I don’t always feel the pain is severe enough to warrant taking it. Does that make sense? I don’t want to become reliant on it, you understand? I prefer to take it only when absolutely necessary. It's a delicate balance, a constant juggling act. Perhaps if I were more organized… But I never was one for schedules.
DOCTOR: Irregular medication adherence can certainly contribute to side effects and reduced effectiveness. Given your forgetfulness, perhaps a medication reminder system would be helpful. There are apps for smartphones, or even simple pill organizers. As for the naproxen, we could try reducing the dosage slightly and see if that mitigates the drowsiness, while still providing adequate pain relief. However, it’s important to be consistent with whatever regimen we decide on. Now, let's discuss your overall activity level. What does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my husband and I, we’re both retired now. He used to be a teacher, a history teacher. He spends most of his time reading, or tending to his garden. I try to keep busy. I do the housework, mostly. And I volunteer at the church, a couple of days a week. I help with the flower arrangements, and sometimes I bake for the bake sales. I used to enjoy walking, but my arthritis makes it rather difficult now. A short stroll around the block is about all I can manage. And even that leaves me aching for hours afterwards. It's… frustrating, you know? I used to be so active. Now, I feel like I’m constantly slowing down. I try to stay positive, but it's hard sometimes. It's a constant battle against the pain, a constant struggle to maintain some semblance of normalcy. I do try to keep my hands moving, you know? Little tasks around the house, things like knitting or gardening. But even those become painful after a while. It's a vicious cycle, really. The pain prevents me from being active, and being inactive makes the pain worse. A terrible, terrible cycle.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re very active despite the challenges your arthritis presents. The cycle you describe is common, unfortunately. Alright, Mrs. Rannells. Given your irregular medication adherence, the drowsiness from the naproxen, and your activity level, I recommend we try a combination of approaches. First, let’s work on establishing a more consistent medication schedule. I can provide you with a pill organizer and a reminder app for your phone. Second, let's consider a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your muscles, improve your range of motion, and manage your pain. Third, we can explore alternative pain management techniques, such as heat or cold therapy. And finally, if these measures aren't sufficient, we can discuss other medication options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, actually. A physical therapist… I hadn’t considered that. And a pill organizer… well, perhaps that would help. My daughter always says I need to be more organized. Heat therapy… I do enjoy a warm bath. It helps with the aching, a little. Yes, that sounds… manageable. It’s a lot to take in, but it’s better than just… accepting the pain, I suppose. I’m willing to try anything, if it means improving my quality of life. I just… I don’t want to become reliant on medication, you understand? That’s my biggest fear. But if a physical therapist can help me strengthen my muscles, and manage the pain without relying on pills… that would be wonderful. Yes, let’s try that. Let’s start with the physical therapist, then. And the pill organizer, of course. My daughter will be so pleased. Though, she’ll probably tell me I should have done this years ago. Bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to write a referral for you to see Dr. Ramirez, a physical therapist at Suburban Rehabilitation Center. They have excellent reviews, and they specialize in osteoarthritis management. I’ll also print out a list of resources on heat and cold therapy, and a guide on setting up medication reminders. As for the pill organizer, you can pick one up at most pharmacies. Now, before we conclude, do you have any other concerns or questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It's just… everything feels a bit overwhelming sometimes. But I feel… more hopeful now. Knowing there are options, you see? That makes a difference. I suppose I should call Dr. Ramirez and schedule an appointment? And pick up a pill organizer on my way home? Yes. That sounds… right. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a great help. Perhaps my daughter was right about seeking medical attention after all. Though, I’ll never admit that to her. Bless her heart, she always knows best. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Rannells, I believe that covers everything. Just schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez at your convenience, and pick up a pill organizer. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m glad I could help. Have a good day, and I hope you find some relief soon. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: .
