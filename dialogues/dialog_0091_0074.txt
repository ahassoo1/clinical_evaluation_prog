DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I reckon it’s my blood pressure. It’s been… high, they said. My regular doctor told me to come see someone, get it checked out proper. I don’t really understand all the numbers and such, but they made it sound important.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. It is important, and I’m glad you came in to address it. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. To start, could you tell me when you first noticed your blood pressure being elevated?
PATIENT: Honestly? I can’t rightly say. Seems like it’s always been a bit… up there, if I’m bein’ honest. But lately, I’ve been feelin’ a little more tired than usual, and my head gets a bit achy sometimes. Maybe a month or so ago is when I started payin’ real attention, thinkin’ somethin’ wasn’t quite right. It coulda been longer, though. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Steines. It can be difficult to pinpoint an exact timeframe, and it’s perfectly normal for memory to change with time. It’s helpful that you’ve noticed some associated symptoms like fatigue and headaches. To clarify, would you describe these headaches as constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, mostly. Not every day, thank goodness. When they do come, it’s like… a dull ache, right across my forehead. Not a sharp pain, just… there. Sometimes it’s worse when I’ve been on my feet a lot, bakin’ you know. That keeps me busy! But not always. It’s just… unpredictable, I suppose. Like the weather.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Steines. “Unpredictable” gives me a good sense of it. And baking certainly does keep you busy! Now, aside from the headaches and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I figured that was just my eyes gettin’ old. I been needin' stronger glasses for a while now, so I didn’t really connect it to anything else. Oh, and sometimes I feel a little… short of breath, even when I ain't doin’ much. But that could just be my age, too. I get winded easy these days. I don't know if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Steines. Those are all important things to note. Blurred vision and shortness of breath, even if you attribute them to age, can be related to blood pressure. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that have been diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of arthritis in my hands a few years back, but they gave me some cream for it and it’s mostly manageable now. Other than that… nothin’ major, as far as I know. I’ve been lucky, mostly. I try to eat right, mostly fruits and vegetables from the garden when I can. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. Didn’t see the need, usually. Just little aches and pains, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Steines. It's good to hear you've been generally healthy, and that you prioritize fruits and vegetables in your diet. And it's helpful to know you haven’t had any significant medical issues previously diagnosed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Not a one. I reckon I’m too stubborn to let them cut on me! Always thought I could tough things out. My mama always said I had a high pain tolerance. But I'm gettin' to the point where toughin' it out ain't workin' as well as it used to. That's why I'm here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Steines. That’s a very sensible approach. Avoiding surgery when possible is always preferable. Now, thinking about your family, do you know if anyone in your family has a history of high blood pressure, heart problems, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mama, she had high blood pressure toward the end of her life. She was a strong woman, but she worried a lot. She was always complainin' about headaches, come to think of it. And my uncle, on my daddy's side… he had a stroke, I believe. Years ago. But other than that, I don't really know much about anyone else's health. We weren't a family that talked a lot about such things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Steines. Knowing about your mother’s history of high blood pressure and your uncle’s stroke is important. Family history can certainly play a role. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama wouldn’t allow it. She always said it was a nasty habit, and bad for your health. I reckon she was right. I've always been careful about what I put in my body. Fresh air and good food, that’s always been my motto.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Steines. Avoiding smoking is a significant factor in maintaining good health. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, especially on a Sunday. Nothing more than that. It helps me relax, and digest my food. But I don't go lookin' for it, and I don't need it to get through the day. Not like some folks.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Steines. Occasional moderate alcohol consumption isn’t typically a concern. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anythin’ in my life, thankfully. I can eat just about anything. I reckon I'm pretty lucky in that regard, too. Though I do try to stay away from too much sugar, that gives me a headache somethin' fierce. But that's just a personal preference, not a true allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Steines. No known allergies is helpful. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Go ahead. I'm not afraid of a little lookin' over, long as it helps. Just be gentle with my old bones, alright? They creak somethin' awful these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Steines. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in... and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. I’m hearing some slight crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of factors. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is currently 162/95 mmHg. That is elevated. I’m also going to feel your pulse at your wrist and ankles. Your pulse is a little weak, but present. Finally, I'd like to briefly look in your ears and eyes. Your ears appear clear, and your eyes show some mild age-related changes, but no immediate concerns. Do you have any questions about what I’m doing or what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Goodness, all that sound complicated! 162… is that bad? And what's "diminished"? I just know my blood pressure is high, that's what the other doctor said. Is it somethin' serious? Should I be worried? I'm not a young woman anymore, but I still got things I want to do, you know? Bakin' contests to win, grandkids to spoil… I don’t want to be laid up in a bed!
DOCTOR: Those are very understandable concerns, Ms. Steines. Let me explain everything as clearly as possible. 162/95 mmHg is considered Stage 2 hypertension, which means your blood pressure is higher than it should be. “Diminished” simply means the sounds of your heart are a bit softer than expected, which, as I mentioned, is common with age. Now, is it serious?
PATIENT: Well… is it? Don't sugarcoat it for me, Doctor. I'd rather know the truth, even if it's not what I want to hear. My mama always said honesty was the best policy, and I reckon she was right about most things. I need to know what I'm lookin' at here. Can it be fixed? Is it somethin' that will get worse, even if I take care of myself?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask those direct questions, Ms. Steines, and I appreciate your honesty. Your mother was absolutely right. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious problems over time, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and vision loss. However, and this is the important part, it’s very manageable, and with proper treatment, we can significantly reduce your risk of complications. It's unlikely to simply go away on its own, but with treatment, it can be controlled. The goal is to lower your blood pressure to a safer range, typically below 130/80 mmHg. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the best course of action for you. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any other underlying causes of your high blood pressure. I would also recommend an electrocardiogram to assess your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds sensible. Blood work and… that other test. I’ll do whatever you think is best, Doctor. As long as it helps me stay healthy and bakin’. I just… I don’t want to be a burden to my grandkids. They already worry about me enough. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens after that? Will I have to take… pills? I don't like takin' pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about taking pills, Ms. Steines, and we’ll explore all available options before resorting to medication. The blood work and ECG should be processed within a few days, typically 2-3 business days. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Depending on the results, we may start with lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. We can also discuss if you are a candidate for a home blood pressure monitor. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to control your blood pressure, then medication may be necessary. There are many different types of blood pressure medications available, and we can find one that is right for you with minimal side effects. We'll discuss the risks and benefits of each option thoroughly before making any decisions. For now, let's focus on getting those tests done and then we can discuss a plan tailored to your individual needs. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. Tests, then a plan. I can do that. I’m a practical woman, always have been. And thank you… for explainin’ everything so clearly, and for not talkin’ down to me. It’s a relief to have someone listenin’. Now… how do we go about gettin’ these tests done? Is there a place I need to go? Do I need to fast beforehand? I got a blueberry pie in the oven right now, and I don’t want it to burn while I’m off gettin’ poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Steines. It’s my pleasure to help, and I’m glad you feel more at ease. The lab is located just down the hall, Room 203. You don’t need a separate appointment; you can go whenever it’s convenient for you. As for fasting, yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. Since you have a pie in the oven, perhaps you could schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning sounds perfect, Doctor. I need to keep an eye on that pie anyway, it's for the county fair! And I reckon I can skip breakfast for a good cause. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? Any paperwork I need to fill out? I always forget my glasses, so I can barely read the fine print these days. And thank you again, Doctor. You've eased my mind a great deal. I feel a lot better knowin' there's a plan.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Steines. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. And a pie for the county fair—excellent! There is a brief consent form you’ll need to fill out at the lab, and they will assist you if you're having trouble with the print. You can ask the phlebotomist for assistance, and they will gladly help you. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, print out a copy of your test order now. She’ll bring it to you, along with the lab’s contact information. For now, why don’t you focus on that prize-winning pie?
PATIENT: That's very kind of you, Doctor. Sarah sounds lovely. I appreciate you thinkin' ahead. Alright, then. I reckon I'll go check on that pie. It's a blueberry-peach one, my grandma's recipe. She always said the secret was a pinch of almond extract. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. I'll see you after the tests. And hopefully, I'll have a blue ribbon to show you next time!
DOCTOR: That sounds wonderful, Ms. Steines! I look forward to hearing about the blue ribbon. Have a wonderful day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
