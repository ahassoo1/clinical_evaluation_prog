DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Raymonde. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I… goodness, where to start? I’ve just been feeling awful, mostly. Sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much. Anything I do eat just… sits there. It's been going on for a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, though. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, that sounds really unpleasant. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Feeling awful” and trouble eating – we’ll definitely figure out what’s going on. You mentioned it’s been going on for “a little while.” Can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific. Hmm. Let me think. It feels like… maybe a couple of months? Or was it longer? I started noticing it around… maybe springtime? I do remember it getting worse after… well, after my husband passed. But I don't know if that’s connected. He’s been gone almost a year now. I just haven't been myself, I suppose. It’s hard to keep track of things when you’re feeling poorly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, getting worse after your husband passed—that gives me a better starting point. It's completely understandable that things feel harder when you’re grieving, and it absolutely could be connected to how you’re feeling physically. Loss of appetite and stomach upset can definitely be part of that. But we want to make sure there isn't something else going on too. Besides the sick stomach and not being able to eat much, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Other symptoms… Let me see. I’ve been… awfully tired. More tired than usual, and I always was a bit of a napper. And… sometimes I feel a little weak. Not like I’m going to fall over, just… lacking energy, you know? Oh, and I've lost a bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser. But then again, I haven't been eating much, have I? It’s all a bit of a muddle.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired, weak, and some weight loss along with the stomach issues. That's helpful. And you're right, those things often go hand-in-hand. Now, just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit more about the sick stomach?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not exactly… painful. More just… queasy. Like I’m going to be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick very often. Maybe once or twice in the last few months. It just feels unsettled all the time. And it happens pretty much all day long, though it’s sometimes worse after I eat something. Even if it’s just a little bit. I used to love my toast and jam in the mornings, but even that doesn’t sound good anymore. It’s just… discouraging.
DOCTOR: Okay, so queasy, not really painful, sometimes worse after eating, and hasn't involved a lot of vomiting. And it's affecting your appetite, even for things you used to enjoy. That gives me a good idea of what we're dealing with. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… medical history. Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must have been… thirty years ago, maybe more? And I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but it’s usually pretty well controlled with medicine. And I have arthritis, in my hands mostly. That’s about it, I think. I see a rheumatologist for that every six months or so. And, of course, I had cancer a few years back. Breast cancer. They said it was caught early, and I had a lumpectomy and some radiation. I’ve been in remission for… oh, I don’t know, five years now, maybe six? It's hard to remember dates. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Raymonde, that's very helpful. Thank you for sharing that with me. Gallbladder removal, high blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of breast cancer in remission – that's important information. And six years in remission is wonderful. Now, are you currently taking any medications for any of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Yes. For my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, I think that’s the name. Just one pill in the morning. And for my arthritis, I take… hmm… Meloxicam, sometimes. Only when it flares up, though. Not every day. And I used to take Tamoxifen after the cancer, but the doctor took me off of that a couple of years ago. Said I didn't need it anymore. Does that sound right? I sometimes forget which pills I’m supposed to take when. My daughter helps me keep track, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril daily for blood pressure, Meloxicam as needed for arthritis, and you were previously on Tamoxifen but are no longer taking it. That's good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of. I used to think I was allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but it turned out I just didn't like getting stung! No, I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicines, as far as I remember. My skin can get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the arthritis acting up. I don’t think that’s an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle before we do a quick physical exam. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no! Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and I certainly don't smoke. My mother always said it was a terrible habit. And drugs… well, that’s just not my style. I’m a simple woman, Doctor. I like my garden, my animals, and a good book. That's all. My husband used to smoke a pipe, but he quit years ago. Before… before he got sick. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers perfectly. That sounds like a lovely life, Raymonde. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And I’ll gently feel your abdomen – that’s your belly – to see if anything feels tender or unusual. Just breathe normally for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your ears look fine, and your throat is clear as well. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. I’m starting on the right side… Is this tender at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… a little bit right there. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that for a while, I think. It doesn’t come and go, really. Just… always a little bit tender. I thought maybe I just ate something bad. But it’s been going on for too long now, I suppose. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. A little tenderness in the upper right abdomen… Not sharp pain, but a dull ache that’s been consistent. Given your history, and what you’ve told me about your symptoms, this could be a few things. It could be related to your gallbladder, even though it was removed a long time ago – sometimes issues can arise in the area. It could also be something else entirely. Anything else feel tender here, or anywhere else in your abdomen?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit all over, really. But nothing specific. It’s just… my stomach feels unsettled, like I said. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain, just a general… discomfort. Like everything is just… off. And I do feel a little bloated, I think. I haven't been to the bathroom regularly lately, either. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettled stomach, general discomfort, some bloating, and not regular bowel movements… Thank you, Raymonde. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I found during the exam, I think it's important to do some further testing to figure out what's going on. I want to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test. These tests will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, and any issues with your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. We'll also want to do a urine test, just to rule out any urinary tract infection. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don’t like going to the hospital, but I want to feel better. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. A stool test… that sounds unpleasant. But if it will help, then I’ll do it. What will happen with the results? Will I have to come back? And how long will it take? I get worried when I have to wait for results.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Raymonde. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests and waiting for results. The stool test isn't the most pleasant thing, but it's a relatively simple procedure, and the lab will give you clear instructions. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for everything to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss them in detail. I’ll call you if anything urgent comes up. Depending on the results, we may need to do further testing, such as an ultrasound of your abdomen. But let's not worry about that right now. Let’s just focus on getting these initial tests done. I'm going to give you a lab order, and instructions for collecting the stool sample. The nurse will also go over everything with you. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh…an ultrasound. That sounds… serious. But okay. The nurse will go over it, you said? That’s good. I always forget things, as you know. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Just… please let me know as soon as you know something. Waiting is the hardest part. And thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for trying to help. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I understand your concerns, and I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. Waiting is the hardest part, and I’ll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab order and instructions. She’s wonderful and will answer any questions you have. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re going to figure this out together. Have a good day, Raymonde. .
