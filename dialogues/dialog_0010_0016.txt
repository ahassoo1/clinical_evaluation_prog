DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… Farson, yes. Look, it’s this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I’m on blood thinners, as you can see from my chart, and I seem to be covered in purple these days. I bumped into a table – a table, Doctor – and I ended up looking like I’d been in a fight. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you’re on warfarin. And you’re right to be concerned about easy bruising, especially with that medication. It is important we figure out what's going on. So, this bruising… how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… well, it’s gradual, isn’t it? At first, it was just a little more than usual, you know? Little knocks, little scrapes. But the last month or so it’s gotten… noticeable. Like I said, a simple bump and I look like a plum. And frankly, it’s concerning. I don’t want to end up with internal bleeding or something. I’m a pathologist, for goodness sake, I know what can happen.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, especially with your profession. It’s good you’re aware of the potential risks. So, you've noticed a definite worsening over the past month, even with minor injuries. Are the bruises appearing without any injury at all?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. A couple of times, I’ve woken up and… well, there’s just a bruise there. On my arms, mostly. I don’t recall hitting anything. I’m not falling or anything, I assure you. It’s just… appearing. I’m starting to feel like an old man, frankly. And I’m not even that old. 58, Doctor. 58! It shouldn’t be happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. Spontaneous bruising is definitely something we need to investigate. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. No, not really. I feel… tired, perhaps? But frankly, who doesn’t feel tired these days? My appetite's been normal, I suppose. No dizziness, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just… this. And the fatigue, but I can’t say for sure it’s related. My wife… well, she passed last year, and it’s been a difficult time, if you understand. Perhaps it’s just that. But I’d rather rule out something… serious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and fatigue is a common symptom. But you are right to be proactive and rule out other possibilities. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to take a look at the bruising more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose. Please, go ahead. I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m honest, but I realize it's necessary. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m a bit of a… delicate flower at the moment. And try not to poke too much. It tends to make things worse, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. I'll be as gentle as possible. And I'll certainly avoid poking unnecessarily. We'll take things slow. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not terribly concerning. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at those bruises. Would you mind rolling up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Alright. There. As you can see. And there are a few more on my legs, but these are the most prominent. They’re… unsightly, frankly. And they don’t seem to be going away quickly. My wife used to say I bruise like a peach. Now, it’s more like a plum, as I mentioned before. She’d… she’d have a good laugh about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see them. They do appear quite extensive. And you're right, they're varying in age. The discoloration and tenderness are consistent with bruising at different stages of healing. Palpation is… mildly tender, but no significant swelling or warmth. No signs of any underlying masses or concerning findings. Okay, Mr. Farson. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, we need to investigate the cause of this easy bruising. Given your warfarin use, we need to check your INR to make sure your medication is within the therapeutic range. We should also run a complete blood count to rule out any underlying blood disorders. And to be thorough, let's do a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Thorough is good. I'd rather know what's going on, even if it's something unpleasant. Warfarin, you see, it's a delicate balance. Too much, and you bleed. Too little, and… well, the consequences are equally undesirable. It's a constant worry, frankly. So, yes. Blood tests. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… try not to draw too much blood. I’m already feeling a bit weak.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Farson. We’ll only draw what’s necessary, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. I’ll order those labs right away. It should take about 10-15 minutes to draw the blood. While we're waiting for the results, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, just the fatigue. And… a bit of a lingering sadness, if I’m honest. But that’s understandable, isn’t it? It’s been a year since my wife passed, but… it still feels raw sometimes. I suppose that’s grief for you. No headaches, no fever, no dizziness. Just… this bruising and the tiredness. And the worry, of course. Constant worry. Is this something serious? Is the warfarin the culprit? It’s exhausting, frankly. Sometimes I just want to… stop taking everything. But I know that’s not a sensible solution.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling this way, Mr. Farson. Grief is a complex process, and it can take a very long time to heal. And it’s natural to worry when you’re experiencing unexplained symptoms, especially when they involve medication. We'll get to the bottom of this. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on, and we can adjust your treatment plan accordingly. While we wait for the results, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes. I take a low-dose aspirin, 81 milligrams, daily. My cardiologist recommended it, years ago, for heart health. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, once a day. Nothing else, really. I’ve tried some herbal remedies in the past, for sleep, but they didn’t seem to help, and I didn’t want to risk any interactions with the warfarin, so I stopped taking them. I’m a cautious man, you see. Always have been. Especially when it comes to my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Aspirin can contribute to bleeding, even at a low dose, so it’s important to consider that as well. The phlebotomist should be with you shortly to draw the blood. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as prolonged bleeding from any cut, nosebleeds that won’t stop, or any signs of internal bleeding like dark stools or abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Prolonged bleeding, dark stools, abdominal pain… emergency room. I've been a pathologist long enough to know the warning signs. I appreciate you reminding me, though. It's easy to dismiss things, to think it's nothing, to delay seeking help. But it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? Especially when you're on blood thinners. Right. Excellent. We will call you as soon as the results are back. It should be within a few hours. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns.
