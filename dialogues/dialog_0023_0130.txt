DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it’s about my family. Lots of… problems, you know? My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my sister, she had trouble with… well, I don’t know what it was, but she was sick for a long time. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you understand? I get… worried.
DOCTOR: I see. Family history is certainly important. While generalized worry is understandable, it doesn't necessarily equate to a medical problem. However, we can certainly explore this further to give you some peace of mind. Let's start with your mother's heart condition. Do you happen to know specifically what she was diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. It was a long time ago. I was just a boy. Something with… the valves, maybe? The doctor said something about valves not working right. She was always tired, and she had to take pills. Lots of pills. I’m sorry, I wish I knew more. It wasn't talked about much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's not uncommon. Vague recollections are typical. And that's perfectly alright. Now, regarding your sister – you mentioned she was sick for a long time. Can you tell me anything more specific about what was bothering her?
PATIENT: She… she lost a lot of weight. And she was always coughing. A bad cough. She went to the hospital a lot. They said something about her… lungs. But I don’t know what kind of trouble with her lungs. It was… a long sickness. Very sad. She's gone now, for… almost ten years.
DOCTOR: I understand. A prolonged illness and loss are difficult. So, to clarify, your mother had potential valve issues with the heart, and your sister experienced weight loss and a chronic cough, ultimately involving her lungs. Given this limited family history, let's move on to your medical background. Have you experienced any similar symptoms – fatigue, shortness of breath, coughing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but… I’m 73! I think that’s normal, right? I walk a lot, I do. I sell things… traveling around. So, maybe that’s why I get tired. No coughing, no pain. I feel… okay. That’s why I’m here, you see. I feel okay, but I worry.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It's prudent to be proactive about health, even without overt symptoms. However, relying solely on feeling okay isn't sufficient. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam, just to establish a baseline and rule out any immediate concerns. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know I’m not going to… end up like them. I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and I’ll begin. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… regular, though somewhat diminished. Not unexpected given your age, but something we’ll note. Now, breathe deeply again… and again… Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi detected. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not critically so. Now, let's check your weight and height, if you don’t mind. You mentioned traveling and selling – what kind of things do you sell?
PATIENT: Uh, I sell… household goods. Little things. Kitchen stuff, cleaning supplies… things like that. To stores, mostly. I travel around a few states, visit different shops. Keeps me busy. Weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I used to be bigger, but I lost some weight last year. Doctor, is my blood pressure… bad? That sounds… high.
DOCTOR: It's not critically high, Mr. Schwer, but it is above the optimal range. We classify it as Stage 1 hypertension. It's something we need to monitor and potentially address. As for your weight, you mentioned a loss. Do you know approximately how much weight you've lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe ten, fifteen pounds? Over the last year, I think. I wasn't eating as much, you know? Didn't have much of an appetite. Just… not hungry. Everything tastes… bland, sometimes. It wasn’t on purpose, really. Just… happened. I’m still able to walk around and sell things, so I didn't really worry about it.
DOCTOR: A ten to fifteen pound unintentional weight loss is… concerning, Mr. Schwer. Coupled with the diminished appetite and bland taste sensation, it warrants further investigation. I'd like to order some basic blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. We also need to rule out any underlying infections or other causes for the weight loss. I’m also ordering a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, despite the clear auscultation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. Just… pills for a cold, maybe. Nothing serious. The tests… that sounds… a lot. Is something wrong, Doctor? Are you worried?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I'm not saying there is something wrong. However, it's my professional responsibility to investigate any concerning symptoms thoroughly. The weight loss, diminished appetite, and slightly elevated blood pressure necessitate these tests to rule out any potential underlying medical issues. It's a precautionary measure, understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. Precautionary. That's… good. I guess. It just… makes me nervous, you know? All these tests. And thinking about my mother and sister… Can we just… hurry up and get it over with? The sooner I know, the sooner I can… relax.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand your anxiety. I’ve already submitted the orders for the blood work and chest X-ray. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll draw the blood now. The chest X-ray can be done either here at the clinic or at a radiology center, depending on availability. My nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. In the meantime, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your diet and lifestyle. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Um… well, breakfast is usually just coffee. Sometimes toast. Lunch… a sandwich, maybe. Whatever I can get at a gas station or small store. Dinner… it varies. Sometimes I get something hot from a diner, sometimes just a snack. I don’t cook much, you know? Traveling all the time. I used to eat more, but like I said… no appetite. It's mostly just… fuel, to keep going.
DOCTOR: A diet consisting primarily of coffee, sandwiches, and gas station snacks is… suboptimal, Mr. Schwer. It’s likely contributing to your diminished appetite and overall lack of energy. However, until we receive the lab results, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My mother didn't like it, so I never started. Bad for you, she said. Always coughing. I drink coffee, but that's it. I don't drink alcohol much either, maybe a beer sometimes with dinner. Mostly, I just… work.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. That's… positive. Given your family history and your current symptoms, coupled with the suboptimal diet, I'm concerned about potential nutritional deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. We'll proceed with the tests and review the results thoroughly. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? How long will it take? I just want to know what’s wrong, or if there’s even anything to worry about. I need to get back to work, you know? I have bills to pay.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you once they are available. In the meantime, I advise you to try and improve your diet. Even small changes can make a difference. Focus on nutrient-rich foods – fruits, vegetables, lean protein. And try to get some rest when you can. I understand you have bills to pay, Mr. Schwer, but your health is paramount. We’ll do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and get you back on your feet. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. My nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
