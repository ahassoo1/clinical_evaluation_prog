DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my leg. It’s been… puffy, you know? After the cancer stuff. It’s just… swelling. It’s a bit annoying, really. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, I understand. Puffy and swelling in your leg after cancer treatment. We definitely want to take a look at that. “After the cancer stuff” – could you tell me a little more about what kind of cancer treatment you had, and when you finished it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… breast cancer. A few years ago now. I had… the chemo, and then the radiation. And then… a little surgery. I finished everything… maybe two years ago? It’s hard to remember exactly. Everything just feels like a blur, honestly. It was a long time ago. Sorry, I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sasha. It is a lot to remember, and two years ago is a reasonable timeframe. Knowing it was breast cancer treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery is very helpful. And it’s good you’re bringing this up now. So, this swelling… is it in one leg or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. My left leg. It started… not a long time after I finished the treatments, but it’s gotten a little worse lately. I thought it might just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It feels… tight, sometimes. And a little heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the left leg, mostly in the calf, started a while after treatment and is now a bit worse, feeling tight and heavy. Do you notice it being worse at any particular time of day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… yes. It’s worse in the evening, definitely. After I’ve been on my feet all day. I do a lot of gardening, you see. And standing… cooking, cleaning… all that. It feels much better when I put my feet up. That’s why I haven’t bothered you before, really. I just rest it. But it's not getting better, and... well, here I am.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Sasha. So it’s exacerbated by activity and relieved with elevation. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, sometimes. Mostly just… heavy. And it feels… warm. Not hot, but… warmer than my other leg. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain or anything. Just… not right. And it makes my shoe feel a bit tight, too.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. Warmth and a feeling of tightness are both things we want to investigate. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your skin on your left leg, or any sores or blisters?
PATIENT: No, no sores or blisters. And… the color looks okay, I think. Maybe a little bit redder than my other leg, but not much. I haven't really paid close attention, to be honest. I mostly just notice it’s puffy. I’m getting a little worried now, though. Is it the cancer coming back? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Sasha, especially given your history. It's good you're bringing this up. While it could be related to the cancer, there are other, more common explanations for swelling in the leg. We need to rule those out first. Could you tell me about any other medical problems you have, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My blood pressure is a little high, the doctor always tells me to watch my salt. And I have a touch of… arthritis in my hands, mostly. Nothing major. I don’t have… the sugar sickness, or heart trouble, no. And I take a little pill for my water pills, you know, for the blood pressure. That’s about it, I think. Oh, and I get Medicare. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Sasha. High blood pressure managed with a water pill, and some arthritis. And yes, Medicare is good to know for billing purposes. Now, let’s talk about medications. You mentioned a water pill for your blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Um… oh dear. I have to ask my daughter, I think. She does all my paperwork. I just… take the little white pill every morning. She fills my little box. I'm so sorry, I really don't know the name. I just know it helps my pressure. Is that okay? I'm not very good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Sasha. We can look it up in your records. Don't worry about it at all. It's very common for patients to not remember medication names. Before we move on, have you had any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. I eat everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Well… except for that time I ate bad oysters, but that wasn’t a medication! Just a bad oyster. Nothing like penicillin or anything. I’m very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Sasha. No known allergies. Okay, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your left leg. I’ll measure the circumference of both legs to see if there’s a difference in size, and check the pulses in your feet. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My leg is a bit tender, you know. And… I don’t like having cold things on my skin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sasha. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll make sure everything is at room temperature. Okay, I’ve listened to your heart and lungs, which sound good. And I’ve examined both legs. Your left leg is indeed a bit swollen compared to your right, and it does feel warmer to the touch. The pulses are present in both legs, but slightly weaker in your left foot. I didn’t notice any skin breakdown or redness, which is good. Based on this exam, it appears we are dealing with edema – swelling – in your left leg. It's possible this is related to the lymphatic system, which can be affected by cancer treatment. However, we need to rule out other causes. I want to order a few tests, including a D-dimer to rule out a blood clot, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests. That sounds… complicated. A D-dimer? A basic what-now? Is it going to hurt? I just… I hope it's not serious. Is it the cancer? But… if you think it's necessary, yes. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… explain things slowly, please? I get a bit confused. And tell me if it will hurt.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Sasha. It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Let me explain slowly. A D-dimer is a simple blood test that helps us rule out a blood clot in your leg. A blood clot can cause swelling and pain, and we want to be sure that’s not what’s happening. The basic metabolic panel is another blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Sometimes kidney problems can cause swelling. Both tests are pretty straightforward – just a little poke in your arm to draw some blood. They shouldn’t be painful, just a brief pinch. I want to emphasize that I'm not saying it’s definitely the cancer, Sasha. We’re just being thorough and ruling out other possible causes. We need to get these tests done before we can determine what’s going on and how to best treat it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. A blood test to check for clots, and another to check my kidneys. And you’re not sure it’s the cancer yet. Just… checking. That’s… good. Better to check, I suppose. Okay. When do I have the tests? And where? Can my daughter come with me? She's much better at understanding these things.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Sasha. You've got it. I’ll write you an order for the lab tests now. You can go to the lab at the hospital – it’s just down the road. They’re open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. And yes, absolutely, your daughter is more than welcome to come with you. Having someone there for support and to help understand the results is a great idea. I'll also order a follow-up appointment for you in one week, so we can discuss the results and plan the next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. One week. And the lab at the hospital. My daughter can definitely come with me. She'll be happy to. She worries about me, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what’s happening. And thank you for not just saying it’s the cancer right away. I think… that’s all I needed to know. Unless… is there anything I should be doing now? Like… putting my feet up, or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. It’s my pleasure. And you’re right to ask about what you can do now. Yes, definitely keep elevating your left leg whenever possible. That will help reduce the swelling. You can also try wearing compression stockings – they help improve blood flow. And avoid prolonged standing or sitting, if you can. I’ll also write a note for you outlining these instructions. Just rest, elevate, and we'll see what the tests show. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and helpful. Thank you again. I’ll see you next week, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I’m glad I could help. You take care, and I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. .
