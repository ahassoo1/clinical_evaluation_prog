DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… let me see. Right. It’s about a test, I think? A drug test. Someone said I needed one. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: A drug test, you say. And who suggested you have this test done, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that is the question, isn't it? I believe… it was someone at work? With the paving company. They just said it was routine. Something about keeping things safe on the job. Honestly, I don’t remember the name. I meet so many people. It's been a long time working out there...
DOCTOR: Routine testing is becoming more common, yes. And it’s not unusual to forget names, especially with a busy job. So, you’re saying you were instructed by someone at the paving company to come in for a drug test, and you don’t recall who specifically gave you the instructions?
PATIENT: That about sums it up, yes. I really wish I could be more help! It's frustrating, you know? I just... things don’t stick like they used to. Is this a normal test? Like, will it hurt? I'm not good with needles.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hughston, it is rather important to know why you’re having this test. It’s not simply a matter of coming in because someone said so. As for the test itself, it’s a standard urine drug screen. It’s generally painless – you simply provide a sample. However, given your concerns, we can discuss alternatives, though they are often less comprehensive and may not be accepted by your employer. First, let's try to establish why this test was requested. Do you have any documentation from your company regarding this?
PATIENT: Documentation? Oh dear. I doubt it. I usually just… do what I’m told. Let me see… No, nothing. I didn’t think to ask for paperwork. They just handed me a slip with the address to come here. Everything’s just… gone. I'm sorry. This is probably making your job harder, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is less efficient when we don't have the necessary information, Ms. Hughston. But we will proceed. Okay, so you were given a slip of paper, but no official documentation. Do you know what substances they are testing for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I wouldn't have the faintest idea. I just assumed… you know… the usual things? I don’t really… partake in anything, if that makes a difference. Not anymore, anyway. It was a long time ago. I just want to make sure I can still do my job, you know? I like operating the equipment. It’s good, solid work.
DOCTOR: "Not anymore?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, it was years ago. Before… before my husband passed. I used to… have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a small beer on the weekends. Nothing serious, I assure you. It was just… a way to relax. But that was a long time ago. I haven't touched a drop in… well, quite a while. It’s irrelevant, isn’t it? It was so long ago. I just want to be clear I’m fit to operate the machinery safely. That’s all.
DOCTOR: It is not irrelevant, Ms. Hughston. Previous substance use can affect the results and how we interpret them. However, given the timeframe you’ve described, it's likely less of a concern. Let’s focus on the present. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I am. Let me see… I take this for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, it's called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind you get at the drugstore. That’s it, I think. Unless… oh, sometimes a little something for sleep. But only when I really can't get to sleep. It's a mild herbal remedy. Melatonin, I believe it’s called. I try not to take too much, you know?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril is good to know. Melatonin and ibuprofen are unlikely to interfere with the test, but we need a complete list. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so, not really. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was ages ago. Oh! Wait. I had a reaction to some sort of antibiotic, years ago. It gave me a terrible rash. I don’t remember the name of it, though. My husband… he always handled the medications. He knew everything. I just… I'm not very good with these things. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. A previous reaction to an unspecified antibiotic. We’ll note that. Now, let's proceed with the urine drug screen. I’m going to have the nurse show you to the restroom to collect a sample. It's a standard procedure, and she will ensure the chain of custody is maintained. Do you have any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no difficulty at all. Plenty of fluids, you know? I’m a good water drinker. That’s what my husband always said. The nurse, you say? That’s alright. I’m a bit nervous, though. Is it going to be… private? I don't mean to be difficult, it’s just… personal, you know? I just… I’m a bit shy.
DOCTOR: Of course it will be private, Ms. Hughston. The nurse will provide you with a private restroom. She will follow standard protocol to ensure your privacy. It’s a routine procedure. I’ll have her come in and explain the process. Please just try to relax, and focus on providing the sample. The results will be sent to the lab, and we will discuss them when they are available. Is there anything else you feel I should know at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It's just… everything feels a bit overwhelming sometimes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll just… wait for the nurse, then. I hope everything goes alright.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in. Please inform her of any difficulties you may have providing a sample. We need to ensure a valid result. Nurse, could you please come in here?
PATIENT: .
