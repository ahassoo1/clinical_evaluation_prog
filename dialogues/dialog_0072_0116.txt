DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. My name is Dr. Hembrey. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…well, my legs, dear. They just ache something awful at night. Been happening for a bit now, and it’s…uncomfortable, to say the least. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just…gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. Ache in your legs, primarily at night. And you say this has developed gradually. Could you describe the ache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it…well, it's not a sharp pain, not like a…a broken bone. It's more like…a pulling. A tightening, almost. Like someone’s squeezing them. And it mostly happens in the calves, I think. Though sometimes it’s hard to tell. I do try to stretch them, but it doesn’t always help, you know? It just…is there. And it keeps me up at night. I don’t recall it happening during the day, thankfully.
DOCTOR: A pulling, tightening sensation, predominantly in the calves, occurring at night. It’s good to hear it isn’t present during the day. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your legs along with the aching?
PATIENT: Swelling…redness… Oh my. Let me think… I don’t believe so, dear. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I wouldn't be certain. But I don’t think they’re swollen. And no redness that I’ve noticed. I check them sometimes, you see, but mostly I just try to ignore it and hope it goes away. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to help me with things like that. But…well, it’s been a long time now. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: No swelling or redness noted by the patient. Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Let's review some other things to get a better picture of what's going on. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, such as diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things my old brain struggles with. I…I don’t think so. I’ve had the usual aches and pains that come with being my age, of course. And a bit of trouble with my arthritis in my hands, but nothing serious. The doctor, back home, he just told me to stay active. I don’t remember ever being told I had anything serious… Diabetes? No, I don't recall that. My heart…well, it beats, doesn't it? I'm terribly sorry, dear. I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Bilstein. We'll take it slow. Any previous surgeries or hospital stays that you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… There was that time I broke my wrist when I was a young girl, climbing a tree. And…oh dear. My appendix, a very long time ago. That was before your time, I’m sure. And… I had a baby, of course! A beautiful boy. He's…gone now. But no other surgeries, that I recall. Just the usual bumps and scrapes over the years, nothing major. Everything was a long time ago, you see. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Wrist fracture as a child, appendectomy, and one previous childbirth. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter pills or creams?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Just a little something for my arthritis now and then, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. Just when it really hurts. And sometimes I take a little something to help me sleep, but not every night. Just when I'm really bothered. And a vitamin D, the doctor suggested that a while back. That’s about it, dear. Nothing fancy. Do you need to know the exact dosages? I'm not very good with those numbers.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, a sleep aid occasionally, and vitamin D. Let's talk about your family, Ms. Bilstein. Is there a history of any medical problems in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's a tough one. My mother...she had a weak heart, I think. It was a long time ago. And my grandmother, she had terrible arthritis in her hands, just like me. Couldn't do a thing with them. And my brother...he had something with his blood pressure, I believe. But that was years and years ago. It’s hard to remember all the details, you see. We didn’t talk about things like that much back then. It was just…different.
DOCTOR: Weak heart in mother, arthritis in grandmother, and hypertension in brother. Alright, Ms. Bilstein, and do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, dear! I would never. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to have a little whiskey now and then, but I never cared for it myself. Never smoked a day in my life, and drugs…well, that’s just not done. I always believed in living a good, clean life. Lots of fresh air and good food, that's what I always did. A little bit of everything in moderation, you see. Do you need to know about my husband? He was a good man.
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine, Ms. Bilstein. Now, one last thing for the history. I see here you are Tlingit. Are there any traditional remedies or healthcare practices you have used in the past, or currently use?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s…a good question. It’s been so long, dear. When I was a little girl, my grandmother used to make teas with different plants from the forest. For aches and pains, and for colds. She knew all the good ones, the ones that would heal you. I remember the smell of them, and she would sing while she made them. But I haven’t done that in years, not since… well, not since she was gone. And I don’t rightly remember what she used, exactly. It was all a long time ago, you see. Things change. Is that helpful, dear? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. That’s very helpful. Now, if you’ll permit me, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That's perfectly alright. Anything you think will help. Go right ahead. Just be gentle, please. My old bones are a little…sensitive these days. I'll do my best to stay still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. It’s all for the best, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bilstein. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your legs. Pulses are present but weak in both feet. No swelling or redness noted. Calves are tender to palpation bilaterally, but no nodules are felt. Range of motion is slightly limited, but no acute pain with movement. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, just a little pinch, dear, when you squeeze. Not terrible, just…a dull ache. Like the rest of them. I didn't even realize they were limited, to be honest. I just haven't been moving around as much lately. And that little pinch...well, it feels like it's just been there a long time. Is that bad? I hope it's nothing serious. It just feels like…old age, maybe.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation bilaterally, with no acute nodules. Range of motion limited, but no acute pain. Okay, Ms. Bilstein. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you are likely experiencing symptoms related to peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, combined with possible age-related muscle aches. The tenderness in your calves, along with the diminished pulses, suggests reduced blood flow to your legs. However, given your age and overall health, it's important to rule out other causes. I want to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. We'll also perform an Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI, which is a simple test to measure the blood flow in your legs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood work? An Ankle-Bra… what did you call it? All those big words make my head spin, dear. Is it something serious? Reduced blood flow…that doesn’t sound good, does it? I just want my legs to stop aching. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? A cream? A wrap? I don’t want to be poked and prodded if it’s nothing serious. I…I just get so worried sometimes. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bilstein. It's perfectly normal to be worried when you’re not feeling well. The blood work is just a routine check to get a better understanding of your overall health. And the ABI is a non-invasive test – it doesn't involve needles or any poking and prodding. We'll just use a special cuff to measure the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. As for what you can do in the meantime, I recommend walking as much as you comfortably can. Even a short walk around the house several times a day can help improve blood flow. Avoid prolonged sitting or standing, and elevate your legs when you’re resting. As for creams or wraps, they likely won’t provide much relief in this case. I also want to discuss a potential referral to a vascular specialist. They are experts in treating conditions affecting blood flow. It's important to have a thorough evaluation to determine the best course of action. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh, walking…that I can do, I suppose. Though my knees aren’t what they used to be. A vascular…what was that word? Oh my, so many specialists… It all sounds so complicated, dear. And expensive, I imagine. I…I don’t have insurance, you see. I just want to get better. Will the walking really help? Is it…serious enough to need a specialist? I'm just an old woman. Maybe it's just age, like I said. Perhaps a bit of rest is all I need. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the need for a specialist, Ms. Bilstein. It’s frustrating to navigate healthcare, especially without insurance. Let me assure you, we'll do everything we can to help. The walking is a good starting point – it can help improve blood flow and reduce your symptoms. However, given your concerns and the findings on the examination, it's important to rule out any serious underlying conditions. I will connect you with our financial counseling department to explore potential options for assistance. We can also discuss the possibility of a less expensive diagnostic test to start. A specialist consultation doesn't necessarily mean you'll require immediate treatment, but it will provide us with a clearer understanding of your condition and the best course of action. As for being a bother…you are not a bother at all. My job is to help you, and I am here to answer any questions or concerns you may have. For now, let's schedule those blood tests and a referral to vascular. We’ll take it one step at a time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s…kind of you, dear. A financial counselor… that would be helpful. One step at a time…yes. That sounds better. Just a little less overwhelming, you see. Blood tests… alright. And the…vascular doctor. I suppose. Is it far? I don’t drive anymore, you see. My son lives a ways off, but he might be able to help. A little less overwhelming, yes. That's what sounds best. Thank you, dear. You’ve… calmed me down a bit. I’ll trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Let’s get the paperwork started for the blood tests and the referral. The lab is located just down the hall, and the scheduler will work with you to find a convenient appointment time with the vascular specialist. They will also assist with transportation options if needed. I will also give you a printout with some information on peripheral arterial disease and some exercises you can do at home. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I'll leave you to get settled, and a nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so, dear. You've been very thorough. Just… thank you again. I appreciate your kindness and patience. You have a… a lovely way about you. A printout would be helpful, yes. And thank you for reminding me to contact the clinic if things get worse. I…sometimes I forget. But I will try. I really will. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll sit for a bit and…gather my thoughts. Thank you, dear. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take your time and rest. .
