DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s just these hiccups, really. They started a few days ago and… well, they just won’t stop. It’s a bit silly, coming to a doctor for hiccups, but they’re quite persistent. I thought maybe you’d have some ideas.
DOCTOR: Persistent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, persistent. Not constant, mind you. They come and go, usually after I eat something, or sometimes just… randomly. It’s been three days now, and I’ve tried all the usual things – holding my breath, drinking water quickly, getting someone to scare me… nothing seems to work. It's getting a bit tiring, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hiccups are usually benign and self-limiting. But three days is a bit long. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say after you eat, is it with everything you eat, or just certain foods?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it specifically. Let me see… I think it’s more likely with bigger meals, you know? Like a full plate of food, rather than a small snack. And maybe…spicy things? Yes, I had some really lovely chili on Monday night and the hiccups started not long after. Though I had a sandwich yesterday, a pretty normal sandwich, and they came back then too. It’s not every time, but it seems to be connected to eating something substantial, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the hiccups, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. No heartburn, no indigestion, no nausea. Just the hiccups. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A bit tired, maybe, but that's just old age creeping up on me! I've been sleeping alright, eating alright… everything else is normal. It's just this… hic… annoying twitching. It's making it hard to enjoy my tea, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had hiccups like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. When I was younger, I used to get them all the time. My mother always said it was because I ate too fast! They’d usually go away on their own, like she predicted, though. But I haven’t had them this bad, or this long, in… well, decades, I’d say. Definitely not decades. It feels different this time, somehow. Not worse, exactly, just… more stubborn.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I hope you don't mind, I'm not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Sucich. Take your time. I’ve seen plenty of patients with a little less…spring in their step. Now, just breathe normally for me, deep breaths if you can. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels… fine. No pain, no discomfort. A little cool, maybe, but that’s probably just the table. I always feel the cold these days. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No tenderness to palpation. Your abdomen feels soft. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs are clear. This doesn't seem to be anything immediately concerning, physically. Given your age and the intermittent nature of this, it’s likely a benign case of persistent hiccups. However, because it’s lasted for three days, we should probably rule out a few things. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count, just to check your electrolyte levels and make sure there isn't something underlying causing this.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Electrolytes? What exactly are those? Is it something serious? I always worry, you know, when doctors start talking about tests and panels… my husband, bless his soul, always said I was a bit of a hypochondriac. He used to say I imagined illnesses where none existed.
DOCTOR: Electrolytes are minerals in your blood – things like sodium, potassium, calcium – that help your body function properly. Usually, imbalances aren’t serious, but they can sometimes cause hiccups, among other things. It's a very routine test, Ms. Sucich. Just a simple blood draw. I’m not expecting anything to be amiss, but it’s always best to be certain. Your husband was right to encourage caution, but you're quite right to bring this to my attention. It’s my job to rule things out, and this is a sensible first step. We'll get the results back within a day or two, and then we'll go from there. I'm going to give you a requisition form for the lab. They’re just down the hall. You don’t need to fast for this test, so you can eat as usual.
PATIENT: Okay. A requisition form, right. Down the hall. No fasting. That’s… good. I do enjoy my meals, you know. My husband always made the best tea, too. Earl Grey, with a little bit of lemon. Though, I suppose, these hiccups are making it rather difficult to enjoy anything right now. It’s just… annoying. Very annoying. Thank you, Doctor. For being thorough, and for not dismissing it as “just hiccups.”
