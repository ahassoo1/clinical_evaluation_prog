DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it's about my eyes, really. They've been really sensitive to the light lately. It's… uncomfortable, to say the least. Especially bright days. It started a few weeks back, I think – around the 15th of July, if I remember correctly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. Sensitive to light… that started around July 15th. Can you describe the sensitivity a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not just that it’s bright and I squint, you know? It feels… like a burning sensation, almost. And everything seems way too bright, even when it shouldn’t be. Like, indoor lights bother me now, which is new. It makes my eyes water sometimes, too. It’s hard to explain… it’s not pain, exactly, but it’s really irritating. And it makes me want to close my eyes all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning sensation, watering, and it's bothersome enough to make you want to close your eyes. And this is new with indoor lights, too. Do you notice any changes in your vision – blurry vision, spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully nothing like that. My vision itself seems okay. I can see everything as clear as ever, I think. No spots or blurriness, no trouble reading or anything. It's just the light bothering me. It’s… strange. Makes me a bit worried, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know your vision is stable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me think… now that you mention it, I've been getting headaches more often. Not terrible, pounding headaches, but more like a dull ache, right behind my eyes. And… oh! I’ve been more tired than usual, too. Just generally feeling worn out, even after a full night's sleep. It's probably nothing, but I thought I’d mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches behind the eyes and increased fatigue. Have you had any fever, chills, or any nasal congestion or runny nose recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my nose is perfectly fine – no congestion or runny nose at all. I haven’t even had a cold in ages, to be honest. It really just feels like it's something to do with my eyes and the light. This has been a weird few weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: Changed anything…? Hmm. Let me see. No, not really. Same routine, same food, same everything. Oh! Wait. I did start using a new hand soap at work, a couple of weeks ago. It's got a… lemon scent, I think? Maybe that's something? It doesn't get in my eyes, but… I don’t know. It feels like grasping at straws, honestly. But it is a change.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new lemon-scented hand soap at work. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's well-controlled with medication. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, knock on wood. And I take Medicare for insurance. Oh, and… I lost my wife a little over a year ago. That’s… been hard, but it doesn't affect my health, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure, and I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That’s a significant loss. Do you take any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, just the one for the blood pressure. A small orange pill, once a day. And I’ve been taking it religiously, I promise. No over-the-counter stuff either, unless it’s just a pain reliever for a headache, which is rare. And like I said, that's just when it's really bad. I try to tough it out, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had trouble with any medicine. My wife used to joke I had a cast-iron stomach! But seriously, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, just a few quick questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Let me think… my mother had cataracts when she got older, she needed surgery for them. And my grandfather on my father’s side… he had something with his eyes, but I don't remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. Other than that, I don’t recall any major eye problems in the family. It’s not something we discussed a lot, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a month, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just work, and trying to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes. I'll check your vision, pupils, and the overall health of your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let’s check your visual acuity. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Let’s see… um… is that an F? Yes, definitely an F.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And the next line?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s a… P? And then a Z… and… D. P, Z, D. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Good. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes. Just look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No apparent afferent pupillary defect. Now, looking at the retina… there’s some mild pallor of the optic disc. And the vessels appear normal. No hemorrhages or exudates. I'm also noting some mild injection in the conjunctiva. It appears slightly inflamed. Okay. I'm also going to check your eye pressure. It may feel a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… a bit concerning, honestly. "Pallor" and "injection" don't sound good. And I'm ready for the pressure check, even if it’s a little uncomfortable. Just let me know what you find. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, the pressure is slightly elevated in both eyes, measuring 22 in the right eye and 24 in the left. Normal pressure is usually below 21. Alright. Based on what I'm seeing and hearing, it sounds like you may have a case of anterior uveitis, possibly triggered by an inflammatory response. The mild pallor of the optic disc and conjunctival injection support this. The elevated eye pressure is also consistent with that diagnosis. However, we need to rule out other causes. Do you recall any trauma to the eye recently?
PATIENT: No, no trauma at all. I haven’t had any injuries to my eye, or even near my eye, that I can remember. I work as a dental assistant, so I’m very careful with everything. Nothing’s bumped or scratched it, I promise. This all just came on gradually, like I said. Is “anterior uveitis” serious, Doctor? What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No trauma. Anterior uveitis is inflammation of the front part of the eye, the uvea. It can cause light sensitivity, pain, blurred vision, and redness. It can be serious if left untreated, as it can lead to glaucoma, cataracts, and even vision loss, but it's usually manageable with treatment. The fact that your vision is still stable is a good sign. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for underlying inflammatory conditions. And I’m going to prescribe you some topical steroid eye drops to reduce the inflammation. I’ll also refer you to an ophthalmologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and possible further testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, eye drops, and a specialist… all good. I’d rather be safe than sorry, definitely. Steroid eye drops… are there any side effects I should be aware of? And how long will it take to see a specialist? I'm happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor, I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Okay. The steroid eye drops can sometimes cause a temporary increase in eye pressure, which is why we'll monitor that closely. Other potential side effects are rare, but can include blurry vision or irritation. If you experience any significant changes in your vision or increased pain, stop the drops and contact me immediately. I'll write you a prescription for Prednisolone eye drops, four times a day for one week, then taper down to twice a day for another week. I’m also going to send a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-respected ophthalmologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in, but they prioritize urgent cases. I'll also order the blood tests – a complete blood count, ESR, and CRP – to rule out any systemic inflammation. You can get those done at the lab across the street. I’ll give you a requisition form. In the meantime, avoid bright light as much as possible. Wear sunglasses outdoors and consider using a dim lamp indoors. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, Prednisolone drops, tapering down… got it. Monitor for pressure changes, avoid bright light, blood tests… I think I’ve got that all. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. It’s a relief to finally have some answers, even if it’s not a simple fix. Hopefully, this gets sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions after you leave. We'll get those blood tests and specialist appointment scheduled, and hopefully, we can get this uveitis under control quickly. Here are the prescription and lab requisition. Take care, and I’ll see you again after your appointment with Dr. Sharma to discuss the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time and care. I will contact the office if I have any concerns. Have a good day too.
