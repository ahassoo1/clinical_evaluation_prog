DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's about my…well, it's about the bruising. I've been on this blood thinner for a while now, since…well, you can read the chart. But lately, I've been getting bumps and bruises from absolutely nothing. It’s…undignified, frankly. I barely brush against something and poof, another one. It's quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you’ve been on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. And you’re correct, the documentation does indicate a history of easy bruising, but it appears to be increasing recently, is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Increasing is…a polite way to put it. It's becoming ridiculous. I used to just get a little discoloration if I knocked something over. Now? It's like I'm a peach. And honestly, I don’t appreciate being treated like a…a fragile old man. I was perfectly fine before this latest…episode. I’ve always been careful.
DOCTOR: "Episode," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it feels like an episode. A particularly unpleasant one. I mean, one minute I'm puttering around the garden, the next I've got a mark on my arm the size of a silver dollar. It just…appeared. It’s not like I’m falling down constantly, Doctor. I’m still reasonably coordinated, thank you very much. Are you questioning my recollection of events?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Farson, I am not questioning your recollection. It simply helps to understand the pattern of these occurrences. When did you first notice this increase in bruising?
PATIENT: Honestly? About a month ago. Maybe six weeks. It was subtle at first, just a little more color than usual. But it’s gotten progressively worse since then. I thought it might just be my imagination, or…well, old age, naturally. But it's beyond a reasonable amount of… discoloration, if you understand my meaning. I really don't want to end up looking like a Jackson Pollock painting.
DOCTOR: And have there been any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… no, not really. Same aches and pains as always. Appetite's been normal, I suppose. Sleep is…sleep is always a struggle, but that’s nothing new. Oh, wait. Now that you mention it, I did start taking that new supplement, the one my nephew recommended. Something about…turmeric? For inflammation. He swears by it. Could that be doing something? Honestly, I don’t put much stock in those things, but he’s a smart boy.
DOCTOR: Turmeric, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, turmeric. He said it would help with the joints. A capsule, once a day. It’s…yellow, naturally. I’ve been taking it for about three weeks, maybe four. I really don’t know much about it. He just said it was “natural” and good for you. I suppose I should have asked before starting it, but he’s a very persuasive young man. And frankly, I was hoping to avoid another prescription if possible. Is it a problem?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while “natural” doesn’t automatically equate to “harmless,” turmeric – and specifically curcumin, its active component – can have blood-thinning properties. It may be interacting with your warfarin, amplifying its effect. We need to get a more accurate picture of your current anticoagulation status. We’ll need to draw some blood for a PT/INR test. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t believe so. Had plenty of those over the years, unfortunately. Though I’m not particularly fond of them, if that counts. So, a blood test, then? To see how…thin my blood is? I suppose that makes sense. Honestly, it’s just a nuisance. I’ve got things to do, you know. Still, if it will put my mind at ease… and prevent me from looking like a bruised plum… then, yes, let’s get it done. Do I need to fast for this test? And where exactly will this blood be going? I prefer to know these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Farson, a fasting blood test is required. You should have refrained from eating or drinking anything for at least eight hours before the draw. As for where it's going, the sample will be sent to the lab right here in the clinic. They’ll perform the PT/INR to measure your warfarin’s effect. Now, while we wait for the results, I’d advise you to immediately discontinue the turmeric supplement. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Discontinue it? Immediately? Well, that seems a bit…drastic, doesn’t it? I mean, it’s just a little yellow capsule. And it was helping my joints, you know. But fine. Fine. I’ll stop taking it. Immediately. Though I’m not entirely convinced it’s the culprit. It sounds like a perfectly good supplement. And eight hours? That’s a long time to go without a cup of coffee. Are you sure there isn’t anything else I should know? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while I appreciate your skepticism, it is prudent to err on the side of caution. Curcumin is known to interfere with anticoagulation. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in two business days. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums, blood in your urine or stool, excessive bruising – you are to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Excessive bruising? You think I haven’t noticed that already? Very well. Yes, I understand. Blood tests, no turmeric, and a trip to the emergency room if I resemble a ripe plum. Honestly, the drama. Alright, let’s get this over with. Where is this nurse, then? I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, tell her to be gentle. I bruise easily, as we’ve established. .
