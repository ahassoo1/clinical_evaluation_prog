DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it frankly, I’m dating someone. A… a lovely man, really. But one must be prudent, you understand. A woman can’t be too careful these days. And I simply want to be certain everything is as it should be before… well, before things progress any further. It’s a matter of responsibility, really.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you, Esthela. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. So, you're looking for a general health check-up, with a particular focus on… sexually transmitted infections, perhaps?
PATIENT: "Sexually transmitted infections?" Oh, my. Doctor, that sounds… rather blunt, doesn’t it? I hadn’t explicitly thought of it in those terms. I simply want to ensure I am in good health, a suitable companion. One doesn't discuss such things so directly. It's about overall wellness, a preventative measure, and a demonstration of respect for… everyone involved. Though, if you must put a name to it, I suppose ensuring there are no… unpleasant surprises would be accurate.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Esthela. My apologies for being so… direct. It's a habit, I suppose. We can certainly focus on a general health assessment, including screening for any infections that could be relevant. That way, we can address any concerns and ensure you feel completely comfortable and safe. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: That is… considerably better, Doctor. Yes, a “general health assessment” sounds far more… refined. And I appreciate you understanding my sensibilities. Now, tell me, what exactly does this assessment entail? I do try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but one can never be too thorough, can one?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It usually involves a review of your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, allergies, medications you’re taking. Then we'll do a physical exam – checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs. We can also run some blood tests to check for things like anemia, diabetes, and, if you’d like, screen for any sexually transmitted infections. We can also discuss your family history and any lifestyle factors that might be relevant. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… comprehensive. Blood pressure, pulse, those are sensible. And family history is always important. I suppose blood tests are unavoidable, if one is to be truly certain. My mother had… a touch of high blood pressure in her later years, and my father… well, let’s just say he wasn’t one for preventative care. I do take a daily multivitamin, and I try to limit my sugar intake. Although, a small indulgence now and then is permissible, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. A little indulgence is perfectly fine! Balance is key. So, regarding your medical history… have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like asthma, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite… robust, actually. A few minor ailments over the years – a cold here and there, a touch of the flu – but nothing serious. I had my tonsils removed as a child, and I broke my arm once falling from a tree – a rather silly accident, really. But other than that, I’ve been blessed with good health. I do get rather anxious sometimes, though. A tendency to worry, you understand. But I manage it. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Esthela. Tonsils removed, broken arm… noted. And the anxiety… is that something that interferes with your daily life?
PATIENT: Well, "interfere" is perhaps a strong word, Doctor. It’s more of a… persistent awareness. A tendency to anticipate… complications. I find myself planning for every eventuality, you understand. It’s simply… prudent. It doesn’t prevent me from living my life, but it does require a certain… diligence. And sometimes, a good night’s sleep. Though, even that can be… interrupted. It’s a minor inconvenience, really. Nothing worth dwelling on.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're very resourceful and proactive about managing your well-being. Alright, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, I take a daily multivitamin. A standard dose, nothing fancy. And occasionally, if I have a particularly troublesome headache, I might take an ibuprofen. But that's quite infrequent, perhaps once or twice a month, if that. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. It’s simply not… refined to rely on such things. And no prescriptions, Doctor. I pride myself on maintaining my health naturally. Though, I do enjoy a cup of chamomile tea before bed. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea definitely counts! It’s a very soothing remedy. Alright, and do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I don’t believe so, Doctor. I’ve never knowingly had an allergic reaction. As a child, my mother attempted to introduce me to shellfish, but I found the texture… disagreeable. But that wasn’t an allergy, simply a matter of taste. I do get mildly irritated by certain perfumes, but that’s a sensitivity, not an allergy. And dust, of course, but who doesn’t react to dust? No, I can’t recall any true allergies. I’m rather fortunate in that regard. Though, I do find certain fabrics… itchy. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Itchy fabrics aren't typically a medical allergy, but it's good to know. Alright, before we proceed with the physical exam, I just want to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. Such… indelicate questions. I assure you, I maintain a very respectable lifestyle. I have never smoked. Alcohol, perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! That is simply… unthinkable. I find such habits… distasteful. My husband would be most displeased, and quite rightly so. I believe in moderation and self-respect. That is all. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. That is perfectly sufficient. I apologize if my questions were… presumptuous. It’s simply standard procedure. Alright, let’s move on to the physical exam, then. Would you mind stepping onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I am rather particular about scales. Some are… inaccurate, you understand. But if it is necessary… proceed. Though I do hope it is properly calibrated. And please, no sudden movements. I have a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I've just checked the calibration myself. And I'll be very gentle. Please, step on when you’re ready. Alright, and your height is… 166 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, 166 centimeters. Precisely. I always stood very tall for my age, you know. It was quite remarkable. Though, I do believe my posture has… softened somewhat over the years. But 166 centimeters is accurate. Though, I must say, this scale seems… rather unforgiving. Is that the correct reading? It seems… a bit high, doesn’t it? Perhaps it needs adjusting.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is the reading. It's perfectly normal, Esthela. Your Body Mass Index is 33.9, which puts you in the obese category. However, BMI is not a perfect measure, and we will assess your overall health picture. It simply means we should be mindful of your weight. If you're comfortable, please lie down on the examination table, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: "Obese?" Doctor, with all due respect, that is a rather… indelicate term. I am a full-figured woman, certainly. But "obese?" I find that… quite offensive. And frankly, unnecessary. I maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle, as I have already explained. Very well. But I must insist on a clean examination paper. And please, be gentle. I am a sensitive woman. And I do hope this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Esthela. I apologize for using such a clinical term. "Full-figured" is a much more appropriate description. And I will be very gentle. Your heart sounds regular, although I do detect a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we may want to consider an echocardiogram to rule out anything concerning. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: A murmur? Heavens. That sounds… alarming. Though, I suppose one cannot be too careful. My mother always had a rather delicate constitution, so perhaps it is hereditary. But I do hope it is nothing serious. Very well. Proceed with the blood pressure reading. Though, please, do not wrap the cuff too tightly. It tends to make me… anxious. And do tell me if you notice anything… concerning. I prefer to be fully informed, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I’ll be very careful. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. This is considered Stage 1 hypertension. We will need to monitor this and discuss lifestyle modifications or potentially medication. It’s not a cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we should address. Now, I’d like to take a blood sample to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Goodness. This is becoming rather… concerning, isn’t it? My mother also had high blood pressure in her later years. Perhaps it is hereditary, as I suspected. Though, I do maintain a perfectly healthy lifestyle. Perhaps it is simply… stress. A blood sample? Heavens. I dislike needles immensely. And frankly, I find the entire process rather… undignified. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could monitor it for a while longer before resorting to such… drastic measures? I do hope this won’t be too painful. And please, use a small needle. A very small needle.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Esthela. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about needles. The blood sample will give us a more comprehensive picture of your health and help us determine the best course of action. It’s a small prick, and it’s over very quickly. I’ll use the smallest needle possible, and I’ll be very gentle. We will only need a small amount of blood. It will help us rule out any underlying issues and determine if any treatment is necessary. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Absolutely not ready. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite… distressing. Must we really go through with this? Perhaps we could discuss lifestyle modifications first? I do try to eat a healthy diet, and I take a daily multivitamin. And I do try to manage my stress levels, though admittedly, this visit is not helping. Very well. But please, be quick. And do not look directly at me while you are… extracting the blood. It makes me exceedingly uncomfortable. And use a very, very small needle. I cannot stress that enough. And please, warn me before you… insert it. A warning, at the very least. I believe I’m going to faint.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Esthela. We can absolutely start with lifestyle modifications first. There’s no need to rush into anything you’re not comfortable with. Let's discuss some healthy eating habits and stress management techniques. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to re-check your blood pressure and discuss whether blood work is necessary then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Perfectly reasonable indeed. Lifestyle modifications are always a good starting point. And postponing the blood work is… most welcome. Yes, let’s discuss healthy eating habits. I do try to maintain a balanced diet, but perhaps I could improve. And stress management… well, that is a constant struggle. Perhaps you have some helpful suggestions? I do find a warm bath quite soothing, and a cup of chamomile tea before bed. But other than that, I am rather at a loss. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… most understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Esthela. It’s important to me that you feel comfortable and in control of your health. Let’s start with diet. Reducing your salt intake can significantly lower your blood pressure. We can also focus on increasing your intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. As for stress management, regular exercise, mindfulness techniques, and deep breathing exercises can be very helpful. We can also explore options like yoga or meditation. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on healthy eating and stress management techniques?
PATIENT: Resources would be most welcome, Doctor. Yes, anything that might assist me in maintaining a healthy lifestyle would be greatly appreciated. Reducing salt intake… that shouldn’t be too difficult. I do not particularly care for overly salted foods, to be honest. And fruits and vegetables… well, I do enjoy a nice salad. Mindfulness techniques… that sounds rather… New Age, doesn’t it? But I suppose I am willing to try anything, as long as it doesn’t involve… chanting. And deep breathing exercises… well, I suppose those couldn’t hurt. But please, no yoga. I am not particularly flexible. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… most helpful. Perhaps a brochure or two would suffice?
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. No chanting or yoga required! I have some excellent brochures on healthy eating and simple relaxation techniques that you might find helpful. These brochures provide practical tips on reducing your salt intake, increasing your fruit and vegetable consumption, and incorporating relaxation techniques into your daily routine. We’ve covered a lot today. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: These look… quite informative, Doctor. Thank you. Reducing salt intake… that seems manageable. And the relaxation techniques… well, I shall peruse them at my leisure. No, I believe that is all, Doctor. You have addressed my concerns admirably. And you have been… exceedingly patient with my… anxieties. Perhaps a follow-up appointment in a month, as we discussed? Just to re-check my blood pressure and ensure I am making progress? Thank you again, Doctor. You have been… most helpful. And I appreciate your… discretion. It is important to maintain a certain… decorum, you understand.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Esthela. I’m glad I could help. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to re-check your blood pressure and discuss your progress. Our receptionist will be happy to assist you with scheduling. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Esthela. Have a wonderful day.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you again for your… discretion. I shall contact the clinic if I have any concerns. And I shall peruse the brochures at my leisure. Have a wonderful day as well, Doctor. And thank you again for your… patience.
