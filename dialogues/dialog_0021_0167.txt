DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, welcome. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s this foot… my foot is giving me a lot of trouble. It’s… a sore, a bad sore that won’t get better. It hurts to walk, even with slippers. Been hurting for… oh, a little over a month now, I think. Maybe longer. Time… time goes quickly when you’re older.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. A sore that's been bothering you for a month or so. Okay. And is it constantly painful, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yes. But… when I try to walk too much, it gets worse. Like a burning feeling, you know? And sometimes, at night, it throbs. Keeps me awake a little. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel.
DOCTOR: Burning and throbbing… Alright. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Redness, yes. It is red around it, for sure. Swelling… a little bit, maybe? It’s hard for me to tell. My legs… they swell sometimes too, you know? And pus… I don’t think so. I’ve tried to keep it clean with soap and water, but… it’s hard to see way down there. It’s a little… smelly, maybe?
DOCTOR: Smelly… alright. And have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I felt a little warm a few days ago, maybe, but I thought it was just the weather. It gets hot here, you know. No chills, though. Just… tired. I’m usually tired, but maybe a little more than usual.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Okay. And have you had any injuries to your foot recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. I haven't fallen or anything. I'm careful, you know. Just… old age, I think. Things just… happen sometimes. I don't remember anything specific hurting it. It just started to bother me one day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you diabetic, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I am. Been diabetic for… oh, goodness. Maybe twenty years now? I take pills for it, every morning. Sometimes I forget, but mostly I remember. My wife, she used to remind me.
DOCTOR: "Used to?
PATIENT: Oh. She… she passed away last year. Cancer. It was quick. I miss her very much. She always took care of things. Reminded me of my medicine, made sure I ate right… now it’s just me. Sorry, I didn't mean to… to get sad.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. That’s… unfortunate. So, you’re managing your diabetes on your own now?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. I try to. I check my blood sugar when I remember, but it's… harder now. Like I said, my wife, she always helped. I eat okay, mostly fish and rice. Not much sweets. I try to be good. It's just… lonely sometimes. And hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's have a look at this foot. Could you please take off your sock and shoe for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me… just a moment. These old bones aren't as quick as they used to be. There it is. Sorry it’s not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the ulceration near the heel. There's significant erythema and inflammation surrounding the wound. I don't see any drainage at this moment, but there’s clear evidence of tissue breakdown. Given your diabetes, this is concerning. It could be a diabetic foot ulcer. I'm going to gently palpate around the area to assess the depth and extent of the wound. This will likely be painful.
PATIENT: Painful? Oh dear. I have a low pain tolerance, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important, then go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My wife always said I was a baby when it came to pain. But she loved me anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears to be fairly deep… extending through the epidermis and into the deeper tissues. There is tenderness to palpation, and some warmth around the area. I'm concerned about potential infection. We'll need to rule that out. I'm going to order a blood test to check your white blood cell count and blood sugar levels. And I think we need to get a wound culture to identify any bacteria present.
PATIENT: Blood tests… wound culture… oh goodness. That sounds… complicated. What does that mean? Is it… serious, Doctor? Will I need to go to the hospital? I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: It's potentially serious, yes. Diabetic foot ulcers can lead to serious complications if left untreated—infection, even amputation in severe cases. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what we're dealing with. A wound culture simply involves taking a small sample of the fluid from the sore to see what bacteria are present. As for the hospital, we're not talking about the hospital yet. But you might need a referral to a podiatrist, a foot specialist, for debridement—removing the dead tissue from the wound—and ongoing care. Let's get these tests done first, alright?
PATIENT: Amputation…? Oh dear Lord. My wife… she always said I had weak feet. Podiatrist… that sounds expensive. I'm on a fixed income, you know. Medicare… does Medicare cover podiatrists? I don't want to be a burden. I just want my foot to feel better.
DOCTOR: Look, let's not jump to conclusions. We're not talking about amputation yet. And yes, Medicare generally covers podiatry, but it depends on the specific services rendered. We'll have to check the coverage details. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done and getting a proper assessment. I'll write you a referral to a podiatrist—Dr. Kealoha is quite good—and a lab order for the blood work and wound culture. I want you to schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: As soon as possible… yes, Doctor. I understand. Dr. Kealoha… I’ll try. It’s just… everything is so much now. So many appointments, so many tests… My wife used to handle all of this. Is there… is there anything I can do now? Besides the appointments and tests? Something to help it feel better? Just until I see Dr. Kealoha?
DOCTOR: Keep it clean and dry. That's the most important thing. Wash it gently with soap and water, and pat it dry thoroughly. And absolutely no walking barefoot. Wear comfortable, supportive shoes at all times. I'm also prescribing a topical antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection while you wait for the culture results. And try to elevate your foot whenever possible. Now, are there any questions about the referral or the prescriptions?
PATIENT: Topical ointment… elevate… yes. I think so. Medicare… will they call me to schedule the appointments? Or do I have to call them? I’m not very good with the phone anymore. And Dr. Kealoha… is he close by? I don’t drive much anymore, either.
DOCTOR: Medicare won’t call you. You need to call them to schedule the appointments. And Dr. Kealoha's office is located on Kilauea Avenue, about fifteen minutes away. You might want to ask a family member or friend for help with transportation. Honestly, there are a lot of resources available to seniors in this community, if you just look for them. I'll have the nurse print out a list of local assistance programs for you. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Local assistance programs… Yes, that would be good. Very good. My neighbor, Mrs. Kapule, she’s a kind woman. Maybe she could help with the phone and… and the driving. I don't want to be a bother, but… I think… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. And thank you for the list. I’ll try my best to call Medicare. And Mrs. Kapule.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just remember, keep it clean, keep it elevated, and call Medicare. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any signs of infection—increased pain, redness, swelling, fever. The nurse will be in shortly with the list of resources. Have a good day, Mr. Stoegbauer.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
