DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I am Dr. Leidy Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. She’s worried about me. I’ve been… having a little trouble, you see. Mostly with my arm and leg feeling a bit… heavy, sometimes. And the headaches… they’re not new, my mother had terrible headaches, always did. But these… well, they feel different, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. “A little trouble” and “fuzzy” aren’t terribly specific, but we can certainly explore this further. Let’s start with the heaviness in your arm and leg. Is this on one side of your body, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, you’re right, I’m not very good at explaining, am I? It’s… mostly on my right side. My right arm and leg feel… weaker, I suppose. Not completely gone, mind you, just… heavier. Like I’m trying to lift something very heavy all the time. It comes and goes, you see? Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others… well, others it’s quite a bit of effort. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Tofani, though intermittent symptoms can be… challenging to pinpoint. And when you say “challenging,” I mean for accurate diagnosis, of course. Now, this weakness – does it affect your ability to perform everyday tasks?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not really. I still manage. I still cook, you know? And I still try to do a little gardening, though my daughter says I shouldn’t strain myself. It’s more… noticeable. Like, if I’m carrying groceries, my right arm gets tired quicker. Or walking up the stairs, my right leg feels a bit… draggy. It doesn't stop me, just… slows me down a little. And I’m an old woman, so… maybe it’s just age, too? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It is possible, Ms. Tofani. Age certainly plays a role in many changes we experience. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. Let's talk about these headaches. You mentioned your mother had them as well. Can you describe what your headaches feel like?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she suffered something awful with them. Mine aren't that bad, thank goodness. They're… a throbbing, mostly. Usually on the side of my head, right around my temple. Sometimes it feels like a pressure, a squeezing. And sometimes, though not always, I feel a little… nauseous when they come on. Not sick, just… queasy. They don’t last very long, usually. An hour or two, maybe? And I can usually take something for them, a little pill. But lately, they've been… more frequent, I think? Does that help? I wish I was better at remembering things. It’s frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: It does help, Ms. Tofani. Though I understand your frustration with memory. Now, you mentioned a pill you take for the headaches. Do you recall what that medication is?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… my daughter handles most of the pills these days. She keeps them all organized. It’s… a little white one, I think? Or maybe it’s a pale yellow. Small, round… Oh, I feel terrible. I really should know these things. It’s… I think she said it was for… tension? Something to do with tension headaches. I really can’t recall the name. I’m so sorry. I’m just… not good with medications. I always leave that to her.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Tofani. We can certainly sort that out later. It’s not essential at this moment. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, years ago, but they got it under control with pills. And… arthritis, in my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes, makes it hard to grip things. Oh, and… I had my gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. That was… unpleasant. I don't think… I don't remember anything else major. Nothing like… heart trouble or diabetes or anything like that. I went to the doctor regularly for years, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be. My daughter always reminded me what was going on.
DOCTOR: Very good. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, besides the headache pill?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. For the blood pressure, I take… a little orange one, I believe? Every morning. My daughter makes sure I don’t forget. And… sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that too. A little white capsule, I think. But… honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to get confused myself. There are so many pills, and I don't always remember which is for what. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to be so organized, but… things just slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly alright. Let me just review your medication list here… according to the records, you are currently taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and Naproxen 500mg as needed for arthritis. Is that consistent with what you've told me?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that sounds right! Lisinopril… and Naproxen. See, I knew I wasn’t completely losing my mind! My daughter would be so pleased. Yes, those are the ones. She keeps a very detailed list. I’m so grateful for her, you know. She’s a good girl. It’s just… remembering on the spot, that’s the tricky part. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Tofani. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve had a few little rashes, maybe, but nothing serious. My daughter always asks me that, and I always tell her no. I don’t think I have any allergies. But… you know, it’s possible I’ve forgotten something. I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel like I’m just… rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. We’ll proceed carefully. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother, bless her heart, she had those terrible headaches, as I mentioned. And my father, he had… heart trouble, I think. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t remember much. And… my brother, he had diabetes, later in life. It was… difficult for him. I don’t think… I don’t remember anything else significant. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see? Everyone always said our family was… prone to aches and pains, generally. But nothing specific that I can recall. It’s frustrating, really. I wish I had a better memory.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Tofani. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t touched a drop of alcohol since… well, since my wedding day, I suppose. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I was raised better than that. I always said a good cup of tea was enough excitement for me. I believe my husband felt the same. No, I don't partake in any of those things. Is that alright? I hope I'm answering your questions properly.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. Very good. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, let me summarize what we’ve discussed. You’ve been experiencing intermittent weakness on your right side, headaches that have become more frequent, and have a history of high blood pressure, arthritis, and a past gallbladder removal. You are currently taking Lisinopril and Naproxen, and have no known allergies. Your family history includes headaches, heart trouble, and diabetes. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… about right. Yes, you’ve got it all. It’s very kind of you to summarize it like that. It helps me feel… less confused, if that makes sense. Yes, that’s a very good summary. Thank you. Now, what happens next? Do you need to poke and prod me? I don’t mind, you know. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Tofani, a brief physical examination would be helpful. I'll assess your neurological function, check your blood pressure and pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It's quite routine. If you could just sit back and relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Relaxing is something I’m good at! I’ll just sit here and… try not to wiggle too much. Do you need me to close my eyes or anything? I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if I need to do anything. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you need me to repeat anything. My mind isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tofani. I'm going to check your reflexes now. I'm going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your legs. Okay, good reflexes bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Squeeze your hands… yes, I can do that. There. Is that alright? It feels a bit… weak, doesn’t it? I blame the arthritis, mostly. It makes it hard to grip things sometimes. I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. We’ll take it slowly. Now, can you lift your arms up in front of you, like you're trying to reach for something on a high shelf?
PATIENT: Oh… there. It’s a bit… difficult. My right arm feels… heavy, you see? It’s like I’m trying to lift a brick. It’s not painful, just… weak. Is that what you wanted to see, Doctor? I’m sorry if I’m not doing this right. I’m just an old woman, you know. It’s been a long time since anyone asked me to lift things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Tofani. You’re doing perfectly fine. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight… wheezing in your lungs. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? Oh dear. Well, sometimes, yes. Not all the time, mind you. But when I walk up the stairs, or try to do a little gardening, I get a bit… breathless. I always thought it was just old age, you know. And the arthritis, making it harder to move around. I haven’t mentioned it to anyone, really. I didn’t think it was important. It’s just a little puffiness, mostly. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not being a bother.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tofani, you are not being a bother at all. This is all very helpful information. Now, I would like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want to do a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and a CT scan of your brain. The CT scan will help rule out any structural problems. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… a CT scan… that sounds… serious, doesn’t it? But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My daughter always says I worry too much, but… it’s hard not to, when things aren’t quite right. So yes, let’s do the tests. When can we do them? And will they be… painful? I hope not. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then I’m willing. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: The CT scan does require an IV, and you’ll need to lie still for a short period of time, but it shouldn’t be painful. The lab tests are just a simple blood draw. We can schedule the tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. I’ll also write you a prescription for a nebulizer to help with your breathing. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your weakness, shortness of breath, or develop a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, 8:00 AM is fine. Tomorrow morning… yes, that works. A nebulizer… for my breathing? That sounds… helpful. And I understand about the emergency room. If things get worse, go to the emergency room. Yes, I can remember that. My daughter will be pleased you're being so thorough. She worries about me constantly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel… a little less worried now, knowing you’re looking into this. I just… I want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Tofani, that is not too much to ask at all. We’re going to do everything we can to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. We’ll review the test results as soon as they’re available, and discuss a plan of action. Here are the prescriptions and the instructions for the CT scan. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I will see you tomorrow morning. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, and try to rest.
PATIENT: .
