DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, as the paperwork indicates, I requested a general wellness check. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and my wife, Elena, insisted I get a thorough look-over. She worries, bless her heart. I feel quite well, but one can never be too careful, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A sensible woman, your wife. Very good. A wellness check is always prudent, especially with a change in decade. Now, let's begin with a detailed history. You mentioned feeling quite well, but could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Elaborate… yes. Well, I sleep soundly, usually about seven, sometimes eight hours a night. My appetite is… normal. Elena cooks wonderful meals, you understand. I have no pain anywhere, no aches or discomfort. I walk every morning with our dog, Chico – a small terrier, very lively. Perhaps a little tired after a long day of work, but nothing alarming. I wouldn't say I'm as spry as I once was, but that’s to be expected, I think. My digestion is… regular, shall we say? No difficulties there.
DOCTOR: Regular, good. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Mombrun, if you don't mind my asking?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. I’ve been a construction laborer for… well, nearly fifty years now. Mostly framing, roofing, that sort of thing. It keeps me active, keeps me outdoors. Though these days, I mostly supervise, you understand. My son, Ricardo, does most of the heavy lifting. He’s a strong boy. Still, I like being involved, staying busy. Keeps the mind sharp, I believe. Though sometimes I worry about the younger ones not having the same respect for safety as we did back in my day… but that’s another matter.
DOCTOR: Construction… quite physically demanding, even with supervision. Have you experienced any injuries related to your work over the years?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, a few. Nothing serious, thankfully. A sprained ankle when I was a young man, climbing scaffolding. A few bumps and bruises, the usual scrapes. And, well, about ten years ago, I pulled a muscle in my back lifting some lumber. It bothered me for a while, but physical therapy helped. No lingering pain now, not at all. It just gets a little stiff if I stand for too long, that’s all. Nothing that a warm bath doesn’t fix.
DOCTOR: And regarding your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of the sort. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. My father lived to be eighty-eight, very healthy for his age. My mother, as well. Elena’s side of the family is strong too. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, that sort of thing. But as an adult, I haven't been seriously ill. I’ve had my vaccinations, as recommended, and I see a dentist regularly. I take good care of myself, you see. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. Not a surgery, not a hospitalization. I broke my arm when I was a boy – fell out of a mango tree, trying to steal fruit – but it healed cleanly with a cast. Elena always said it served me right for being mischievous. Beyond that, nothing requiring a doctor's attention beyond the usual colds and flu. I pride myself on being a sturdy sort. I suppose I've been lucky as well.
DOCTOR: Lucky, yes. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, my parents were both quite healthy. My father, he had a bit of arthritis in his later years, but that was about it. On Elena's side, her grandmother had high blood pressure, I believe, and her uncle had some sort of… heart trouble, I think. But nothing major. No history of cancer, thankfully. It's a rather healthy family all around, really. We always emphasized a good diet and regular exercise. Elena is very particular about those things, you see. And I try to keep up with her.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, regarding your social history… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said they were a waste of money and a danger to one's health, and I took his advice to heart. As for alcohol, I might have a glass of wine with dinner on occasion – a small glass, perhaps once a week. But that's it. And recreational drugs… well, I’ve never even been tempted. A simple life suits me just fine. I enjoy a good conversation, a good meal, time with my family… that’s enough for me.
DOCTOR: A small glass of wine… acceptable. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Not a single pill. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that’s it. I believe in letting nature take its course, as much as possible. Elena keeps trying to get me to take something for my joints, but I refuse. I’m a stubborn old man, I suppose. I find a warm bath and a good night’s sleep do the trick quite nicely.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Mombrun, while your history appears… unremarkable, it would be imprudent to proceed without a physical examination. It is standard procedure, you understand. Let’s begin with your vital signs. Perhaps you could step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Standard procedure, you say? Of course, perfectly understandable. I wouldn't expect anything less from a professional such as yourself. I used to be quite the athlete, you know. A good examination will show I’m still in reasonably good shape for my age. Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Please remove your shoes and stand facing forward. And try to remain still. 90 kilograms… Now, if you'll step over here, we’ll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Ninety kilograms… well, I suppose I've put on a few pounds since retirement. Elena’s cooking, you understand. Excellent food, but… generous portions. I’m ready when you are. I’ve always been a good patient, you know. I don't mind the poking and prodding, as long as it's for a good cause. Proceed, Doctor. I trust your expertise implicitly.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Mombrun. And I detect a faint murmur. Nothing immediately alarming, but it warrants further investigation. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Throat appears clear, ears unremarkable. Reflexes are within normal limits. Your weight is also a concern, Mr. Mombrun. We need to address your diet and exercise regimen. And we will order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure, you say? And a murmur… I see. Well, that’s… concerning, certainly. I haven't noticed anything amiss, Doctor. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, no dizziness. But I trust your judgment, of course. My weight… yes, I suppose Elena has been hinting at that as well. It's just… difficult, you understand. After fifty years of hard work, one enjoys a bit of comfort. But I’m willing to make changes, Doctor. I want to be around for my grandchildren, you see. What sort of changes do you recommend? And what will the blood work tell us?
DOCTOR: The blood work will assess your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and other vital markers. It will provide a baseline for comparison and help us identify any potential problems. As for lifestyle changes… we need to focus on a low-sodium, low-fat diet, increased physical activity – at least thirty minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week – and, perhaps, a weight management program. I will also prescribe a mild diuretic to help lower your blood pressure, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to review the results and discuss further treatment options. It is crucial to take this seriously, Mr. Mombrun. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to serious complications, such as stroke and heart disease. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes of exercise… low sodium, low fat… a diuretic… Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. It sounds… daunting, I must admit. But I assure you, I will do my best. I’ve always been a disciplined man, and I take your concerns very seriously. Stroke, heart disease… those are frightening prospects, indeed. I’ll speak to Elena, of course. She'll be quite pleased, I imagine. And I’ll adjust my diet immediately. Perhaps you could recommend a reputable weight management program in the area? And is there anything specific I should avoid eating, besides the obvious salty and fatty foods?
DOCTOR: There are several programs at the community center, but frankly, Mr. Mombrun, the most important factor is self-discipline. As for diet… avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, red meat, and limit your alcohol intake. Focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. I will provide you with a handout detailing a healthy eating plan. The diuretic is a low dose, just to get things under control. It may cause increased urination, so plan accordingly. And I expect to see a significant improvement in your lifestyle and vital signs at our follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Increased urination… yes, I suppose that’s to be expected. Self-discipline… you’re right, Doctor. It’s always been my weakness. Elena will be glad to hear I’m finally taking this seriously. Well, I suppose my only remaining question is… are there any exercises you specifically recommend? Something I can do at home, perhaps? My knees aren't what they used to be, you understand. Walking is fine, but I’d like to strengthen my legs and core if possible. And thank you, Doctor. For your time, and your guidance. I appreciate your frankness, even if it is a little… sobering.
DOCTOR: Walking is excellent, Mr. Mombrun. But I recommend chair exercises to strengthen your legs and core. There are numerous resources online, demonstrating proper technique. I will have the nurse provide you with a list of reputable websites. And while I appreciate your willingness to cooperate, remember that lifestyle changes are a long-term commitment. It requires dedication, discipline, and a proactive approach. Very well. I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the handouts and website list. Do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Chair exercises… excellent. I'll look into that immediately. And thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I understand you’re a busy man. I won’t keep you any longer. I'll make those lifestyle changes, Doctor. I promise. I have grandchildren to see grow up, after all.
