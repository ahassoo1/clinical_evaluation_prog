DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're a new patient. Welcome to the practice. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um, it’s… well, it's my stomach, really. I’ve been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s just… annoying, mostly. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, to be honest. Sorry.
DOCTOR: "A while now," is rather vague, Ms. Nahrwold. We do need to establish a timeline for medical accuracy, you understand. Can you perhaps recall if it began before or after a specific event?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry. Um… Let me think… I got married, like, six months ago? Maybe it started… around then? Or a little after? It’s hard to say. Things were… busy, you know? I just sort of… noticed it happening, and it hasn’t really stopped since.
DOCTOR: Six months is still rather prolonged for what you describe as "annoying." Has the diarrhea been constant for the entirety of those six months, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It… it has its good days and bad days. Like, sometimes I’ll be fine for a week, maybe, and then it’ll just… start up again. It's mostly bad days lately though, I think. And it's… worse when I eat certain things. But I honestly can’t remember what things. It feels like everything bothers it now.
DOCTOR: I see. So, intermittent diarrhea for approximately six months, worsening recently, and seemingly triggered by dietary factors, though you’re unable to pinpoint specifics. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I… I don't think so? I mean, I haven’t really looked closely, if that makes sense. I just… go to the bathroom, and then… deal with it. It's embarrassing to talk about, honestly. Sorry. I don’t usually pay attention to… details like that.
DOCTOR: A lack of specific observation can hinder a proper diagnosis, Ms. Nahrwold. However, we can proceed. Have you experienced any accompanying symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Accompanying symptoms? Like what kind of symptoms? I feel… tired, sometimes. More tired than usual, anyway. And my stomach… it hurts. It cramps a lot. Not all the time, just… when the diarrhea is bad. Oh, and I've been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. That’s probably it.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, abdominal cramping concurrent with diarrhea, and unintentional weight loss. These are all pertinent details. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… That’s a good question. I… I think I had something when I was little? My mom said it was something with my stomach, and I couldn’t eat certain things. She always made sure I had special food. But I don’t really remember what it was called. And… I think they mentioned something about celiac disease? Maybe? It was a long time ago. And then…something about my intestines? It’s all very vague.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… unhelpful, Ms. Nahrwold. We really need to establish definitive diagnoses, not possibilities from childhood. Do you have any records from your pediatrician, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don't think so. My mom… she moved a lot, and I think all those records got lost. I’m really sorry. I wish I could remember more. It's just… I've never been very good at keeping track of things like that. And honestly, it never seemed that serious when I was little. Just… special food.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your surgical history. Have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures performed?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never. I... I don't even like hospitals. I try to avoid them if I can. This is… kind of stressful, to be honest. Is something wrong? Are you worried?
DOCTOR: We are attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history, Ms. Nahrwold. Your anxiety is noted, but it does not alter the necessity of accurate information. Now, concerning your family history… Are there any instances of gastrointestinal disorders – such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease – within your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh… My aunt… I think she had something with her stomach? She was always sick, and she had to go to the hospital a lot. My mom said it was something… autoimmune? And… my grandfather, on my dad’s side, he had really bad stomach pains when he was older. He was always complaining about it. I don’t know what exactly it was, though. They didn't really talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Autoimmune disorder in an aunt, and abdominal pain in a grandfather. Noted. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And I definitely don’t do drugs. I’m married, you know? My husband wouldn't like that. We mostly just… stay home, and watch TV. It's pretty quiet.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that's just a mild allergy. Nothing serious. And I think I had a rash once after taking some kind of… antibiotic? A long time ago. But I don’t remember what it was called. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering medications. It’s all just a blur. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Nahrwold, I'm going to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Is it… going to hurt? I’m a little scared of doctors, to be honest. And… is it really necessary? Could we maybe just try some medicine first?
DOCTOR: A physical examination is necessary, Ms. Nahrwold, to properly assess your condition. It will not be unduly painful. I will palpate your abdomen to check for tenderness or abnormalities. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. Now, please lie down. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Okay… Just… be gentle, please? And tell me what you’re doing? It makes me less nervous if I know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. I am now gently pressing on your abdomen to assess for any areas of tenderness or distention. I’m starting here, on your right side. Any discomfort?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a little. Right there… kind of hurts. Not a lot, but… it’s uncomfortable. Like a… dull ache. And… it feels… a little swollen, maybe? I don’t know. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Noted. Moving down now. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yeah, that… that really hurts. Like a sharp pain, kind of. It's… really low down, on my right side. Is something wrong? Please tell me what's happening! I'm getting really scared now.
DOCTOR: Noted. Now, lower left quadrant. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: That's… a little tender, but not as bad as the other side. Just… a dull ache. It feels… tight. It's… uncomfortable, but I can handle it. Is it something serious? I really don't want to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nahrwold. I have completed the abdominal examination. I detected tenderness in the lower right quadrant, as you indicated, and some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding, which is somewhat reassuring. Given your history of chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the tenderness I’ve detected, I suspect a possible inflammatory bowel condition. However, to definitively determine the cause, we will need to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture and ova and parasites exam, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A CT scan? That sounds… scary. And what do all those tests… mean? I don’t understand. Is it… is it cancer? And what if it is something really bad? I… I don’t even know what an inflammatory bowel condition is. Please explain it to me, Doctor. And… what are the options if it's bad? I need to know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, please try to remain calm. A CT scan is a standard imaging procedure; it is not inherently dangerous. It allows us to visualize the internal organs and identify any abnormalities. As for your questions about inflammatory bowel conditions, they are chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. They include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Symptoms can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss, as you've been experiencing. Regarding your concern about cancer, it is unlikely, but it is important to rule out all possibilities. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide appropriate treatment. We will discuss the results of the tests in detail once they are available. At this point, we are simply gathering information. For now, I recommend a bland diet, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding any foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Bland diet… no triggering foods… tests to rule things out… It’s just… it’s a lot to take in. And what if the tests show something bad? What do they do for inflammatory bowel disease? Is there… a cure? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks, worrying.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, it is best not to dwell on worst-case scenarios before we have any definitive results. Treatment for inflammatory bowel disease varies depending on the severity and type of condition. It may include medications to reduce inflammation, dietary modifications, and, in some cases, surgery. There is currently no cure for IBD, but it can be effectively managed with appropriate treatment. The laboratory results should be available within 3 to 5 business days. The CT scan results may take a bit longer, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I am prescribing a course of mesalamine, an anti-inflammatory medication, to help manage your symptoms. It’s important you take it as prescribed. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it’s not too bad. When should I call if… if things get worse? What counts as worse?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, if you experience any of the following, you should seek immediate medical attention: high fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, persistent vomiting, or inability to keep fluids down. If your symptoms worsen despite taking the mesalamine, or if you develop any new symptoms, please contact the office immediately. I am providing you with a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. It's best to have a specialist manage this case. Here are your prescriptions and referral information. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Fever, severe pain, blood… worsening symptoms… gastroenterologist… It’s a lot to remember. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I… I guess I’ll go home now and try to… rest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow the instructions carefully, Ms. Nahrwold. And do try to remain calm. Have a good day.
