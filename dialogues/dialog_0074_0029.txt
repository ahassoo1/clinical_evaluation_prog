DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what it is, to be honest. Just a few bites and I feel like I've had a big meal. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, for about a month now. That’s good information to start with. To help me understand this a bit better, could you describe what that “full” feeling is like?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's not exactly pain, not like a stomach ache. It's more… a pressure, I guess. Right here, under my ribs. And it just feels like there's no room, even if I haven’t eaten much. Like something's blocking things, but not hurting. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Obarr. Pressure under the ribs, a feeling of fullness even with small amounts of food, and no sharp pain – that's helpful. And it's consistently in that upper abdomen area?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yeah. Sometimes it feels a little higher up, towards my chest, but mostly right under my ribs. It seems to happen with every meal, doesn’t matter what time of day. Breakfast, lunch, supper… all the same. I haven't noticed it with snacks, though. Just the proper meals.
DOCTOR: Okay, so consistent with meals, not snacks, and primarily under the ribs, sometimes extending a bit higher. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Let me think... Well, I've been a little tired lately, but I figured that’s just getting old. I haven't really connected it to the eating thing. And… I’ve been burping a bit more, I suppose. Not constantly, but more than usual. That's about it, I think. Nothing else really stands out.
DOCTOR: Alright, some increased fatigue and more frequent burping along with the early satiety and pressure. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical background. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years now. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. My doctor back home – Dr. Williams – always said I had a strong constitution. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, otherwise generally healthy, no current medications other than occasional aspirin. That’s good to know. And how about any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, grew up on fish and berries, you know? Haida diet, generally. Nothing ever bothered me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like stomach cancer, esophageal problems, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother lived to be 92, and she was pretty healthy all her life. My father… he had some trouble with his heart later on, but I don’t know about stomach problems. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. We didn’t talk about health much back then. It wasn’t really something we focused on. So, I don't really have an answer for you there. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Obarr. It's common for family medical history to be limited. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I live with my wife, Mary. We've been married for sixty years now. We mostly keep to ourselves, quiet life. I used to be a fisherman, but I retired about twenty years ago. I do a bit of carving now, mostly traditional Haida art. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with supper now and then. And I don’t smoke. I try to stay active, walk the beach most days, weather permitting.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to see if I can get a better sense of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind at all. I’m used to doctors poking around, being an old man. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your abdomen isn't tender, but I can feel a bit of fullness in your upper abdomen, as you mentioned. It’s not significantly distended, but it is slightly firm to the touch. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to your gallbladder removal years ago, even though that was a long time ago, or something else affecting your stomach or esophagus. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and some liver function tests. We might also consider an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work sounds alright. An… endo-what-sit? That sounds a bit more serious. What does that involve? Is it painful? I'm not keen on anything too invasive, if I can avoid it. Just trying to understand what we're talking about here.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Obarr, and I’m glad you asked. An upper endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and the beginning of your small intestine. It allows us to directly visualize the lining of these organs and check for any abnormalities, like inflammation, ulcers, or tumors. It's not completely painless, but we can give you medication to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most patients describe it as feeling a bit of pressure or fullness. You will be lightly sedated during the procedure, so you likely won’t remember much of it. It is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. We wouldn’t proceed unless we felt it was necessary. We can always start with the blood work and see what that reveals. It might give us enough information to avoid the endoscopy. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Sedated, you say? That sounds a little better. I still don’t like the idea of sticking a tube down my throat, but if it's the best way to find out what’s wrong… alright. Let’s start with the blood work, like you said. See what that shows first. And then we can talk about this… endo-thing. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Mr. Obarr. We’ll start with the blood work and see what that reveals. Yes, for the blood work, you will need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We can schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. And I’ll give you a requisition form to take with you. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Tomorrow morning, no food… got it. And call if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful explaining things. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll see you tomorrow then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll see you tomorrow morning then. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes before then.
