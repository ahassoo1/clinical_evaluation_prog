DOCTOR: Hi Chellsea, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. I am here because… well, I was told I have cancer.
DOCTOR: Oh, Chellsea, I’m so sorry to hear that. That must be incredibly frightening news. Can you tell me a little bit more about who told you, and what exactly they said?
PATIENT: It was… the hospital, I believe. A doctor there. He said… he said there were some spots. Bad spots. He used words I didn’t understand, honestly. Something about… stages? And needing treatment. I just… I just know it's cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable – medical terminology can be really confusing. It’s good you came in to discuss this further. “Spots” and “stages” do sound concerning, and it’s important to get a clearer picture. Do you happen to remember where these spots were located?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t recall specifically. It was… a scan, I think? On my chest, maybe? It all happened so fast. They just told me I needed to see someone. A specialist, they said. That’s how I got your name. I… I wasn’t really thinking clearly. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Chellsea. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed in a situation like that. Don’t worry about not remembering all the details. We can piece things together. Do you have any records from the hospital – a discharge summary, the scan results themselves, anything like that?
PATIENT: I think I have something… It’s all the papers they gave me. I didn’t really look at them. I was… scared. It’s probably all just doctor-talk anyway. I'm sorry it's not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, this is actually quite helpful. It looks like you had a chest scan on July 15th, and the report does mention some “nodules” in your lungs. “Nodules” are basically small spots. They can be caused by a number of things, not just cancer – old infections, inflammation, even just benign growths. We need to figure out what these are specifically. Do you have any symptoms at all – any cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: A little tired, yes. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes I have a cough. Not a bad cough, just… a little one. Mostly in the mornings. I haven’t lost weight, not that I know of. I haven’t been paying much attention to things, to be honest. Everything feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little fatigue and a morning cough. That’s good information. And you’re right, it's completely understandable to not be fully present when you're processing something like this. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven’t been sick much, really. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. But nothing serious. My husband… he passed away last year. Unexpectedly. That was… difficult. I haven’t really focused on my own health since then. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: I'm so very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. That's an enormous loss, and it's completely understandable that your own health might not have been a priority since then. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. And yes, Medicare is good to know. Alright. So, no major medical problems in the past, just the usual childhood illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital stays, other than… visiting with my husband. I've always been healthy, until… this. It's just... it feels so strange. I don't understand why this is happening.
DOCTOR: It is strange, and it's perfectly normal to feel confused and scared when something unexpected like this happens. Okay, so no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… I’ve never had a problem. I’m pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And sometimes allergies can develop later in life, but it's helpful to know you haven't had any issues so far. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing at all. I don’t take anything. I try to eat healthy, but that’s about it. I used to take a multivitamin, a long time ago. But I stopped. It didn’t seem to do anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Alright, Chellsea, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I think it would be helpful to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I hope it doesn't take long. I get a little nervous with doctors, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It won’t take long. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished in the upper lobes, both sides. Not significantly, but it’s worth noting. Your heart sounds regular and strong. No murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now.
PATIENT: Okay. That… feels a little tender. On the right side. But it’s probably nothing. I bruise easily, sometimes. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, you’re right, it’s probably nothing. It can be tender for some people, and bruising easily is good to know. I’m just checking for any areas of discomfort or masses. It doesn’t feel like there's anything concerning, but it's good we noted it. Everything else appears normal. Reflexes are intact, and I don't see any obvious skin abnormalities. Alright, Chellsea, based on the physical exam and what you’ve told me, I think the next step is to get some further testing to understand what’s going on with those nodules on your lungs. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to compare with the previous scan, and a CT scan with contrast to get a more detailed image. We’ll also want to do some blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More scans? More tests? I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s wrong. What… what if it is cancer? What happens then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Chellsea, and it’s okay to feel scared. It’s important to remember that having nodules on a scan doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many things can cause them, and often they turn out to be benign. But if it is cancer, there are many effective treatments available, and the prognosis depends on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as your overall health. We would discuss all of your options thoroughly and create a treatment plan that's right for you. I would also refer you to an oncologist - a cancer specialist - to guide you through that process. First, let's get those tests done and see what we're dealing with. We'll take it one step at a time. I will have the lab order sent over. Do you have any preferences for where you'd like to get the blood work done?
PATIENT: Okay. One step at a time. I don’t really have a preference for the lab. Whatever is closest, I suppose. I just… I don't want to wait too long. The waiting is the worst part. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. The waiting is definitely the hardest part. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours. The scans will take a little longer, maybe 3-5 business days to get a full report from the radiologist. I will have my nurse call you as soon as they come in. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – like a persistent cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or unexplained weight loss – please don't hesitate to call us. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I hope… I hope everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help, and I want you to know I'm here for you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. We'll get through this together. Please let the nurse know if you have any trouble scheduling the tests or have any questions. And remember, try not to worry too much until we have more information. Take care, Chellsea. .
