DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 88 years young. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Eighty-eight, and still sharper than most folks half my age, thank you very much. Though I doubt you’d know anything about that. Anyway, it’s this… business with my stool. Been seeing blood, you see. Not a good sign, not a good sign at all. Happened a couple times now. Don’t need a lecture on my diet, mind you, I’ve lived a long life and know what I can and can’t handle.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom, and I certainly wouldn't dream of lecturing you on your life choices. It’s good you’ve been aware of this change. Seeing blood in the stool is something we always want to investigate to understand the cause. Could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want from me, a painting? It’s red, naturally. Like blood usually is. Though, now that you mention it… the last time, it was a bit darker, almost… brownish. And there wasn’t a lot, mind you. Just… streaks. Not enough to raise a real alarm, but enough to bother a man who keeps an eye on things, you understand. And frankly, it’s a bit undignified for a Haida man, if you ask me. Though I doubt you’d understand that either.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that for me, Mr. Rowbottom. The color and amount are both helpful details. Darker blood can sometimes indicate it’s been digested a bit longer, which can give us clues. And I understand your concern completely – any change in bowel habits is worth investigating, and your dignity is certainly important. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Hmph. “Investigating.” Fancy words. It was… oh, let me think. About a week ago, give or take. Maybe a little longer. I was… well, it was after I had some smoked salmon. Though I eat smoked salmon all the time! Never had a problem before. Could be the salmon, I suppose. Though it was good salmon, mind you. Real good. Not that you’d know quality if it bit you. And it was definitely after I’d already… you know. A few hours after. Does that make any sense? It’s hard to recall things precisely at my age.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Rowbottom. A week ago, following a meal of smoked salmon. And you've eaten smoked salmon before without issue. We’ll certainly keep that in mind. Now, besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… now that you ask… it's been a bit… looser, I suppose. Not terrible, mind you. I've had worse. But not as… firm as it usually is. And I’ve had to go a bit more often, if you catch my drift. Though I drink plenty of fluids, so it’s not like I’m dehydrated or anything. It’s just… different. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. Everything starts to… loosen up. Though I maintain a good constitution, all things considered. Better than most young whippersnappers these days.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing all of this with me, Mr. Rowbottom. Looser stools and increased frequency alongside the blood – that’s helpful information. It’s good you’re observant of these changes. To get a complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever recently?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little discomfort sometimes, but nothing a man couldn’t handle. And definitely no vomiting. I haven't thrown up in… well, I can’t even remember the last time. And no fever, no chills, nothing like that. I feel… alright, all things considered. Just this… business with the stool. Honestly, I think it's probably just something I ate. Though, I suppose a doctor’s got to do what a doctor’s got to do. Don’t want to waste your time with an old man and his… digestion.
DOCTOR: It’s never a waste of my time, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s my job to investigate these things, even if it turns out to be something minor. No abdominal pain, no vomiting, no fever – that's all good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical history. As if I haven’t lived a life outside of doctor’s offices. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my prostate a few years back, but that sorted itself out, thankfully. And I broke my wrist when I was a young man, foolishly trying to… never mind. Nothing serious. And… oh, I had high blood pressure for a while, but I stopped taking the pills. Didn't like the way they made me feel. Felt sluggish. I prefer to keep things natural, you understand. And frankly, I haven't seen a proper doctor in… well, a long time. Is that what you want to know? I’m a hardy Haida man, not some delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. A history of prostate trouble, a broken wrist, and past high blood pressure – all helpful to know. And I understand your preference for a natural approach. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… oh, yes. A tonsillectomy when I was a boy. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… that’s it. No, nothing else. Definitely no major surgeries. I’ve always been careful, you see. Avoided risky activities. And… well, Haida men don’t just go under the knife for fun, you understand. It’s a sacred thing, the body. So, no, just the tonsils. A long time ago. Really, I’ve been remarkably healthy for my age. Perhaps you should be asking me for medical advice.
DOCTOR: I certainly appreciate your robust health, Mr. Rowbottom. A tonsillectomy as a child – that's good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmph. Now there’s a complicated question. My mother lived to be 92, but she always had a weak constitution. My father… well, he was a fisherman, hard life, died young. Heart trouble, I think. And my brother… he wasn’t very careful with himself. Lived fast, died young as well. Not much for longevity on that side of the family, frankly. Mostly strong wills and short lifespans. Does that tell you anything useful, Doctor? I doubt it. Haida people don’t tend to dwell on such things. We focus on the present, not the past.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rowbottom. History of heart trouble in the family, and a shorter lifespan overall – that’s helpful information. And I respect your cultural perspective. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medications? Absolutely not. As I said, I prefer to keep things natural. I might take a little bit of fish oil sometimes, for the joints, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, mind you. And no vitamins, no herbal supplements, nothing like that. I eat a good diet, keep active, and that’s enough for me. I’ve always been skeptical of those pills they push on you these days. More harm than good, if you ask me. Though I suppose you wouldn’t agree.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Mr. Rowbottom. Fish oil for the joints is perfectly fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I might get a bit of a rash if I brush against certain plants, but nothing serious. And I’ve never had a reaction to any food, or any medication for that matter. I’ve always been a hardy specimen, as I’ve mentioned. Though I suppose a proper doctor would insist on asking all these questions, regardless. It's your job, I suppose. Honestly, I think I’ve told you everything you need to know. This stool business is probably just something I ate. A bit of bad salmon, perhaps? Or too much smoked herring?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, could you please tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmph. What is a lifestyle, these days? I live a quiet life, mostly. I used to fish, a lot. But my back isn't what it used to be. Now I spend most of my time reading, tending to my garden, and… well, remembering things. I don't drink much anymore, maybe a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. And I certainly don't smoke. Never liked it. I live alone, mostly keep to myself. Not much socializing these days. It’s a simple life, but it suits me. A dignified life, you might say. Though I doubt you’d understand. Is that what you wanted to know? I’m not one for fancy hobbies or extravagant pursuits.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a good understanding of your daily life. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me assess your overall health and try to determine the cause of the blood in your stool. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then check your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam, you say? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been examined enough in my life to last several lifetimes. But… alright. If you insist. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I’m a remarkably healthy specimen, as I’ve repeatedly mentioned. But go ahead, if it makes you feel better. Just… be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And don't poke around too much. I have a good constitution, you know. I don't need you rummaging around unnecessarily. Just get it over with, quickly. I have things to do, you see. Important things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns, and I will only perform the necessary examination. We’ll start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No masses palpated. Mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are normoactive.
PATIENT: Hmph. Mild tenderness, you say? Probably just gas. I had a bit of cabbage with dinner last night. Shouldn't be anything to worry about. Though I suppose a doctor's got to do what a doctor's got to do. Are you finished poking around now? I'm starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. Honestly, I've endured worse. But I’d rather not spend all day lying here getting prodded. So, what's your verdict, Doctor? Is it something serious? Or just a bit of bad cabbage?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. Based on the physical exam, there is mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no other significant findings. Given your history of recent changes in bowel habits, and the presence of blood in your stool, we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Given your age and symptoms, a colonoscopy is the most appropriate next step. It allows us to visualize the entire colon and identify any potential abnormalities, such as polyps, inflammation, or other causes of bleeding. However, before scheduling a colonoscopy, I would also like to order a stool test to check for infection and occult blood. This will provide us with additional information and help guide our decision-making. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Hmph. A colonoscopy? You want to… look inside me? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just prescribe me something? A bit of something to settle my stomach? Or perhaps a change in diet? I told you, I suspect it’s just the cabbage. And I certainly don’t want to go through a lot of… preparation for this procedure, if it’s just a bit of bad food. As for the stool test… well, I suppose that’s less invasive. But honestly, I don’t see the point. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I think I know my own body. And I suspect it’s just a bit of indigestion. Though, fine. Order your tests, if you must. But I’m not promising to follow through with any further procedures. Understand? I have things to do, you see. Important things. Not a lot of time left, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy is an invasive procedure, and I would not recommend it if it were not necessary. However, given your symptoms and age, it is the most effective way to rule out any serious underlying conditions. We can discuss alternatives, but they would not be as comprehensive. I’ll order the stool test as a first step. That will give us more information before we decide on the next course of action. The test involves collecting a small sample of your stool, which you can do at home. I will provide you with instructions on how to do so. If the stool test is negative, we can revisit the discussion about the colonoscopy. I want to assure you that your comfort and preferences are my priority. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A stool test, then. Fine. It’s better than having someone… rummage around inside me. But I’m telling you, it’s just the cabbage. And don’t expect me to jump at the chance of a colonoscopy if this test comes back negative. I have a long life of experience, Doctor. I know my body. And frankly, I’d rather spend my remaining time tending to my garden than lying in a hospital bed. Give me the instructions, then. Let’s get this over with. And don’t bother calling me with good news. I’m expecting a negative result. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have things to do. Important things. A man’s garden doesn’t tend itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here are the instructions for the stool test. It explains how to collect the sample and where to drop it off at the lab. Please read them carefully. The lab will contact you with the results, usually within a week. If you haven’t heard anything after that time, please contact my office, and we'll follow up. I understand your concerns about the colonoscopy, and we can discuss it further if the stool test is negative. I want to thank you for coming in today, and I wish you all the best. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, a man’s garden does require tending. Get back to it.
PATIENT: .
