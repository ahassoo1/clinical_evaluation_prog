DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Segretto, yes, that's me. Well, it's this… this going to the bathroom business. It’s just… too often, you know? It's a nuisance, really. Used to be simple, now it’s… well, a bother. I don’t recall exactly when it started, honestly. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” right. Well, it’s good you’re here to get it checked out, regardless. “Too often” is a bit vague, Mr. Segretto. Could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea… hmm. Let me think. Used to be, maybe two, three times a day. Now? Oh, I don't know… six, seven maybe? Could be more. Honestly, I don’t count anymore. It’s embarrassing to even talk about. My wife does most of the… remembering these things. She’s the practical one.
DOCTOR: Six or seven times a day… and has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Not like I woke up one morning and bam, suddenly I was running to the… well, you know. It just… crept up on me. Little by little. Like a slow leak, my wife says. She always has a saying for everything, that woman. A good woman, though. Very practical. You wouldn’t catch me keeping track of these things. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the frequency, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, sometimes I feel like I don’t… completely empty the bladder, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left. And occasionally, a little discomfort. Not pain, mind you. Just… a nagging feeling. It’s probably nothing. Old age again, most likely. Everything aches a little these days. I wouldn’t bother you with it, but my wife insisted. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is what a lot of people say. Incomplete emptying and discomfort are things we need to look into. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness, no. No blood. Definitely no blood. My wife would have noticed that right away. She’s very observant, that one. She'd be all over me if there was blood. No, no blood at all. I’m fairly certain. She does the… checking, mostly. You know, the practical things. I mostly just… feel the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Now you’re asking about… everything, aren't you? Everything’s connected, I suppose. Well, they're… regular enough. Not perfect, mind you. Getting old, things slow down. A little constipation sometimes, but nothing a little prune juice can’t fix. My wife makes sure I get enough fiber. She's very good at… managing things. Honestly, Doctor, I don't see what all this… questioning has to do with my bladder.
DOCTOR: It's all connected, Mr. Segretto. The urinary and digestive systems work closely together. Constipation can affect your bladder function. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health problems… hmm. Well, I had a little trouble with my heart a few years back, but they gave me some pills, and it’s been alright since then. I take those every day, religiously. And my blood pressure… sometimes a little high, sometimes a little low. It fluctuates. My wife keeps track of it. She has a little machine, you know? And I think I had some kind of… infection once, a long time ago. Pneumonia, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, it was all so long ago, I barely remember. I’m not one for dwelling on the past. She’d have a better list than me, honestly. A much better list.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the ones for your heart?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, there’s a little blue pill for… well, you know. For… keeping things regular. My wife said I should. Helps with the… plumbing, she said. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for the pain. But that’s only when it gets bad. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a lot of pills. My wife has them all organized in little containers. She’s a marvel, really. I just… take them. I don’t bother with the details. Makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I think… yes. Years ago, when I was a young man, I had my appendix taken out. That was… a long time ago. And… I think I had something done on my knee, but it was so long ago, I barely remember. It was before we moved to this farm, I think. My wife would know for sure. She remembers everything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with dates or… medical history. It all just… blends together after a while. She'd have a better recollection.
DOCTOR: And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, goodness. Well, my father… he had some trouble with his prostate, I think. That was a long time ago, of course. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. Nothing too serious, as far as I recall. Honestly, Doctor, we didn’t talk much about medical things back then. It wasn’t something we dwelled on. My wife's family… they were all pretty healthy, I think. She comes from a long line of strong women, that one. She’d know much more about the details. I mostly just… lived my life. Didn't pay much attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's move on to a quick physical exam, then. Perhaps that will give us a better idea of what's going on. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: A physical exam… well, alright. I suppose so. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, but if it helps… Fine. Just try not to take too long, alright? I have chores to do, you know. The chickens need feeding. My wife gets upset if I fall behind. She’s very particular about things being done on time. Lead the way, Doctor. Just be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Please, lie down on the table. We'll start with your abdomen. Just relax. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… uncomfortable, maybe. But no sharp pain. It feels… normal, I suppose. Old age, you know? Everything aches a little. My wife says I’m getting too stiff. She rubs my back with some kind of cream. Helps a little. Just… try not to push too hard, alright? I don't want to pull anything. I’m not as young as I used to be. Is that normal? This feeling? Everything feels normal, but she said... …she said it shouldn’t feel like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little tender. Yes, right there. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It feels… full, maybe? Like something’s pressing. I don't know. It's hard to explain. My wife said… she said sometimes I get a little bloated. She makes me drink some tea. Helps a little. Is that bad? Should it feel like that? I'm just… not sure. I haven't paid much attention to these things, you see. My wife is much better at… noticing these things. She has a good eye for detail, that one. She'd know if it was bad. She always does.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. Sounds are present, but a little… sluggish. Now, let's check your prostate. This will involve a quick digital rectal exam. It's not the most comfortable thing, but it's important. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? Oh, goodness. That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean… I'm not sure I… Well, I suppose if you say it’s important… My wife always says I should listen to the doctor. She's very sensible, that one. Alright, alright. Go ahead. But… be quick, alright? And gentle. I haven't… well, it's been a long time since anyone's done anything like that. It's a little… embarrassing, you see. And try not to make a fuss. My wife would be… concerned. She's very particular about things being done discreetly. Just get it over with, if you would. Quickly and discreetly.
DOCTOR: Alright. The prostate feels… slightly enlarged. Not alarmingly so, but it’s definitely contributing to your symptoms. I also feel a small amount of residual urine. Now, I'm going to order a urine analysis and a PSA test. The PSA test will help us assess your prostate health further. We'll also check your kidney function. It's important to rule out any other underlying issues.
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Well, alright. If that’s what you think is necessary. My wife always says it’s better to be safe than sorry. She's very practical, that one. Urine analysis, PSA test… kidney function… I’m not sure what all that means, but… alright. When will I get the results? And… will it be painful? I don't like needles, you see. And… will my wife need to come with me? She’s much better at understanding these medical things. She always asks the right questions. Just… try to explain it to me simply, alright? And quickly. I have chores to do, you know. The chickens…
DOCTOR: The urine analysis is just a simple sample. The PSA test involves a small blood draw. It will be a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. We should have the results back in about a week. Based on the preliminary findings, it appears you may have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That means your prostate is enlarged, which is common in men your age. It’s causing the frequent urination and incomplete emptying. We'll treat it with medication. I'm going to prescribe tamsulosin. It will help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. We'll start with a low dose and adjust it as needed. I’ll also recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Medication… tamsulosin… alright. Sounds… complicated. Relax the muscles… increasing fluids… avoiding caffeine… My wife is going to be very particular about the caffeine. She makes me drink herbal tea, you know? Lots of herbal tea. And… what are the side effects? I don't want to feel worse, you see. And… will I need to come back for more tests? My wife doesn't like me being away from the farm for too long. She worries about the chickens… and… what if it doesn’t work? What if it’s something… serious? She’d be very concerned. She always expects the worst, that one. Just… explain it to me simply, alright? And slowly. And tell me… will my wife need to come with me for the next visit? She's much better at asking the right questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. Let’s go through this slowly. Tamsulosin is a common medication for BPH. The side effects are usually mild, such as dizziness or lightheadedness. It’s important to take it with food and to stand up slowly to avoid feeling dizzy. We'll monitor your symptoms closely and adjust the dosage as needed. It’s unlikely to be something serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities. That’s why we're doing the tests. Yes, it would be helpful if your wife accompanied you to the next visit. She seems very involved in your care, and it's always good to have someone else to ask questions and help you remember the instructions. I can explain everything to both of you. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing with the medication. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as fever, chills, or difficulty urinating, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… difficulty urinating… alright. My wife will be very concerned about those. She always expects the worst, you know? Two weeks… alright. I’ll remember that. My wife will remind me. One question… will this medication affect my… constitution? I’m a very practical man, you see. I need to be able to… handle my chores. And… will it affect the chickens? My wife is very particular about the quality of the eggs. She says it’s all about my… well-being. And… is there anything I need to tell my wife? She's much better at understanding these medical things, you know. She always asks the right questions. She'll want to know everything. Just tell me what I need to tell her. Simply. And slowly. And please, don’t use any complicated medical terms. She gets confused easily. Just… tell me what I need to tell my wife.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, the medication shouldn't affect your constitution, or your ability to handle your chores. It's specifically designed to improve your urinary function, not to cause any other side effects. And it certainly won’t affect the chickens. You can tell your wife that I’ve prescribed a medication to help with your frequent urination. It will relax the muscles in your bladder and make it easier to empty. It's important to take it with food and to stand up slowly. She should also be aware of any potential side effects, such as dizziness or lightheadedness, and to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms. I understand that your wife is very involved in your care, but it’s important that you also understand the instructions and are able to communicate any concerns directly to me. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Alright. I think… I think that’s everything. My wife will remind me of the details. She always does. She has a very good memory, you see. Just one more thing… will this medication affect my… stamina? I need to be able to… maintain the farm, you know. She's very particular about… everything. Just tell me… simply. And slowly. For my wife. And please, don't use any complicated medical terms. She gets confused easily. And… can we schedule the follow-up appointment for a Tuesday? She prefers Tuesdays. It's… a good day for her. And… can we make it in the morning? She likes mornings. And… tell me again… what was the name of the medication? Just for my wife. She always wants to know the name of everything. Just… tell me again. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, the medication, tamsulosin, should not affect your stamina. It's designed to improve your urinary function, not to cause any other side effects. We can schedule your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday morning. Let me check the availability… yes, 9:00 AM is open. And to reiterate, your wife is welcome to accompany you to the next appointment. I’m happy to explain everything to both of you. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM on Tuesday… alright. My wife will be very pleased. She prefers mornings, you see. No, I think… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient. My wife will be very grateful. She always says… well, she always says thank you. She’s a very practical woman, you see. I suppose I’ll see you next Tuesday then. 9:00 AM. Thank you again, Doctor. And… thank you for being so patient. .
