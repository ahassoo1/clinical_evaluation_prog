DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Donate. It is an honor to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though the chart likely has that information. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirement for masks and other protective equipment. I have some difficulties with those, and I need to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that is possible.
DOCTOR: An exemption, huh. Right. Well, let's start with this "difficulty" you're experiencing. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is not a matter of simply disliking the masks, understand. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and a good portion of my duties require me to be… close to people. Very close. The masks, they make it difficult to… read people, to gauge their emotional state. And that is very important in my line of work, to ensure safety for everyone involved. It feels… disconnected, and potentially unsafe, to not be able to see expressions clearly. It also creates a bit of… anxiety, if that makes sense. I worry I will miss something vital.
DOCTOR: Anxiety… alright. And how long have you been experiencing this difficulty with the masks?
PATIENT: It began with the initial implementation of the mandates, back in… March of this year, I believe. At first, I thought it was simply an adjustment period. But the feeling hasn’t lessened, Doctor. If anything, it has grown a little stronger, as the requirements have become more consistent. I tried different types of masks, looser ones, tighter ones… but none of them seem to alleviate the problem. It's the obstruction of facial cues, primarily. It makes me feel… less effective, and a little uneasy.
DOCTOR: So, you're saying this isn't a physical discomfort, but more of a… professional concern?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. It isn't that they cause me pain, or trouble breathing. The physical sensation is… tolerable. But as a Protective Service Worker, my effectiveness relies heavily on observation and understanding. The masks hinder that significantly. It impacts my ability to de-escalate situations, to assess threats… to truly connect with the individuals I am assisting. It's a professional impediment, if you will. I understand the importance of safety, of course, and I wouldn't want to compromise anyone's well-being. But this feels like a significant hurdle to providing the best possible service.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you discussed this with your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, I have, Doctor. Several times. I explained my concerns to my supervisor, and to the head of HR. They were… understanding, to a degree. However, the policy is firm. Everyone is required to wear full PPE, masks included, regardless of individual circumstances. They suggested I try relaxation techniques, or perhaps explore different mask options. But, as I mentioned before, I have already tried those avenues. They did offer me a lighter workload, to minimize contact, but that isn't a long-term solution. I enjoy my work, and I want to continue performing my duties to the fullest extent possible. That is why I am here today, seeking a medical perspective. Perhaps there is a way to document this issue in a way that would allow for an exemption.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, to even consider something like that, we need to rule out any underlying conditions that might be contributing to this anxiety. Have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety or any other mental health condition?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have never been formally diagnosed with anxiety, or any other mental health condition. I consider myself a fairly… grounded individual. I spend a lot of time outdoors, connecting with nature. I also practice traditional Lakota ceremonies, which provide a great deal of peace and… centeredness. This feeling is directly related to the masks, and the impact they have on my ability to perform my job effectively. It is a situational response, not a pre-existing condition, as far as I am aware. I have always been capable of handling stressful situations, and I am not one to easily become… flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see no history of mental health diagnoses in your EHR. Now, let's talk about your medical history in general. Any significant illnesses, surgeries, or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My medical history is relatively unremarkable. I have always been quite fortunate in regards to my health. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a child, but I recovered fully. I had my appendix removed when I was in my early twenties, but that was a routine procedure, with no lasting complications. And currently, I am not taking any medications whatsoever. I prefer to rely on natural remedies and a healthy lifestyle to maintain my well-being. I have Medicare, of course, for routine check-ups, but I rarely find the need to utilize it. I believe strongly in preventative care, and I am diligent about staying active and eating well.
DOCTOR: And allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies to report, Doctor. Neither food allergies, nor environmental allergies. I am able to be around cats, dogs, pollen, dust… everything, really. I grew up on the reservation, and spent a great deal of time outdoors, surrounded by nature. I believe that has built up a certain resilience in my system. It is another reason why I find this situation with the masks so… perplexing. It isn't a physical reaction, not in the traditional sense. It is purely a professional and… observational impediment.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Nothing extensive, just listen to your lungs and check your vitals. Then we can discuss this further. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That is perfectly alright with me. I understand the need for due diligence. A physical exam is a reasonable step. Please, proceed at your convenience. I am here to cooperate in any way I can to resolve this matter. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and to explore potential solutions. I trust your professional judgment, and I am hopeful we can find a path forward.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could just hop up on the table for me… First, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128/76. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi noted. Seems healthy, as you said. Do you have any history of claustrophobia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never experienced claustrophobia. As I mentioned earlier, I spent a great deal of my life outdoors, and I am very comfortable in open spaces. I have also spent time in… enclosed spaces, such as traditional sweat lodges, and I have never felt unduly distressed or anxious in those environments. I am not one to feel confined easily. It reinforces my belief that this issue is not a physical one, but rather a situational impediment related to my professional duties. It is the obstruction of visual cues, the inability to read people, that is causing the difficulty, not a feeling of being trapped or confined.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Knabenshue, I understand your concerns. However, documenting a medical exemption for something that isn’t a clear physiological issue is difficult. It's not a matter of wanting to deny you, it's a matter of ethical and legal responsibility. To be frank, it’s hard to justify an exemption solely based on professional discomfort. I can document your concerns about the impact on your ability to assess situations, but a full exemption is unlikely. Would you be open to exploring accommodations with your employer?
PATIENT: I understand your position, Doctor, and I appreciate your honesty. I anticipated as much, frankly. I realize that requesting a full exemption based solely on professional discomfort is… unorthodox. And I certainly do not want to place you in an uncomfortable position. I value your ethical responsibilities, and I respect your judgment. Exploring accommodations with my employer would be a reasonable course of action. Perhaps a documented note outlining my concerns, and suggesting potential modifications to my duties, would be helpful. I am open to any suggestions you might have regarding accommodations, and I would be grateful for your support in that endeavor. A note detailing the impact on my observational abilities, and the potential safety implications, would be a valuable asset in my discussions with my supervisor and HR. Thank you for acknowledging my concerns, and for your willingness to assist me in any way possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've drafted a note outlining your concerns – the impact of mask-wearing on your ability to assess nonverbal cues, potential for misinterpreting situations, and the importance of visual observation in your role as a Protective Service Worker. It also mentions your lack of any underlying medical conditions contributing to this anxiety. I'll also include a recommendation for a discussion with your employer regarding potential accommodations, such as modified duties or alternative communication strategies. Does this seem sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, this is… remarkably thorough. You have accurately captured my concerns, and the language is professional and respectful. The recommendation for a discussion regarding accommodations is also appreciated. This note will be immensely helpful in my conversations with my supervisor and HR. I believe this is a reasonable and ethical document, and it provides a solid foundation for a productive dialogue. Thank you, Doctor Donate. I am very grateful for your time, your attention, and your willingness to assist me in navigating this situation. I feel much more confident now, knowing that I have a documented assessment of my concerns, and a professional recommendation for potential accommodations. This is precisely what I was hoping for. I truly appreciate your support. Is there anything further I need to do at this time?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Knabenshue, I don’t believe so. Just take this note to your employer and start a conversation. If you run into any roadblocks, feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss it further. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you the best of luck. And please, don't hesitate to prioritize your well-being.
PATIENT: It was an equal pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I sincerely appreciate your compassionate care, and your willingness to listen to my concerns. I will certainly keep you informed of my progress, and I will not hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Thank you again for everything. Have a wonderful day, Doctor Donate.
