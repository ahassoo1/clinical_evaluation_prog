DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. My name is Dr. Andraca, and I'm one of the internal medicine physicians here. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this weakness… getting worse, you see. It’s in my legs mostly, but… it feels like it’s creeping up a little. My wife, Leilani, she says I’m slower too. It's just... harder to do things I used to do easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness that's getting progressively worse, primarily in your legs, and your wife has noticed you're moving slower. That's certainly concerning, and we'll get to the bottom of it. When you say "creeping up," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s hard to explain. Not pain, you understand. More like… heavier. My arms feel… tired sometimes now, when they didn't before. And even talking… sometimes the words don’t come as quick as they used to. It’s not all the time, but… it’s worrying me, you see. I don't want to become a burden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Asthore, and it's good you're paying attention to these changes. It’s definitely worth investigating. So, to clarify, the weakness started in your legs, and now you're noticing fatigue and some difficulty with speech as well?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. Started in my legs, definitely. Maybe… two, three years ago? Slow at first. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s… not just old age, is it? It keeps… adding on. My hands get shaky sometimes too, when I try to hold something. Small things, but they add up. Leilani says I should come see someone, and I thought maybe… maybe it’s time.
DOCTOR: You're right to come in, Mr. Asthore, and Leilani sounds like a very good advocate for you. It’s good you’re listening to her. It's important to figure out what’s going on. Let’s go through some more details. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness, fatigue, and speech difficulties?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. And… oh! I get so tired, even after a good night’s sleep. Like… bone tired. And… well, this is embarrassing… sometimes I have trouble remembering things. Not big things, mostly just… names. Or where I put my glasses. My wife laughs and says I always did misplace things, but… it’s a little more than usual, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, persistent fatigue even with sleep, and some memory difficulties, specifically with names and misplaced items. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was diagnosed with… something a long time ago. Years and years. Something with my nerves, I think. The doctor said it was… Multiple… something. Multiple Sclerosis, that was it! Yes, that was it. It’s been… quiet for a long time, though. I haven’t had much trouble with it. Until lately, that is. I mostly just tried to stay active, you know? Keep moving. And I see my regular doctor for checkups.
DOCTOR: Okay, Multiple Sclerosis. That’s very important information, thank you. And you say it’s been relatively quiet for a long time, but now you're noticing a return of symptoms. Do you recall when you were originally diagnosed with MS, and have you had any specific treatments for it over the years?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. Back in the 1960s, I think? Maybe 1965? I was quite young. The doctor… he gave me some shots, I think. Interferon, maybe? Something like that. But it didn’t seem to do much, so I stopped after a while. It made me feel awful, and honestly, I was able to manage pretty well on my own for a long time. Just tried to stay healthy, exercise, and… well, that’s about it. I haven't really seen a specialist for it since then. It just… wasn’t bothering me much.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed in the 1960s with MS, treated with interferon briefly but discontinued due to side effects. You haven’t seen a specialist for it in many years. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of neurological conditions, like MS or Parkinson's disease, in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had some trouble walking when she got older. But the doctor said it was just arthritis. And my sister, she had… something with her balance, I think. But I don’t remember the name of it. Nothing like… this, though. No one else that I can recall had any trouble with nerves or… walking funny or anything like that. We didn’t talk about things much back then, you know? It wasn't like today with all the information.
DOCTOR: I understand. It wasn’t common to discuss medical histories in detail back then. So, no strong family history of neurological conditions that you're aware of. Let’s move on to your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just a few things, Doctor. I take a blood pressure medicine… Lisinopril, I think it's called. And I take a baby aspirin every day, just to help with my heart, the doctor said. And I take a multivitamin, just a regular one. Nothing fancy. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my knees when they bother me… ibuprofen. But that’s only when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, a daily aspirin, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always checks before I take something new, just to be safe. She's very careful. But no, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your vital signs, do a neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78 and regular, respiratory rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6. Okay, Mr. Asthore, I’m going to check your strength. Please push against my hands when I ask. Your strength is a little diminished in both legs, particularly on the right. Your reflexes are a bit quicker than I’d expect, and your coordination isn’t quite as smooth as it should be. Your walk is a little unsteady as well. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Alright, Mr. Asthore, that concludes the exam. I appreciate your cooperation. Based on your history and the exam findings, the symptoms you’re experiencing are consistent with a possible flare-up of your Multiple Sclerosis. However, we need to rule out other potential causes as well. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, vitamin B12 level, and thyroid function tests. I’d also like to get an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to look for any new or active lesions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. MRI… that sounds a little scary, but I trust you. If it helps find out what’s going on, then I’m happy to do it. Leilani will want to know everything, of course. She’s always been the practical one. I’ll let her know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand your concern about the MRI, but it's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s happening in your brain and spinal cord. I’ll explain the procedure to you in more detail before you go for it. It's a painless test, and you'll be able to listen to music during it if you’d like. In the meantime, while we’re waiting for the test results, I recommend you continue to stay active as much as you comfortably can, but avoid overexertion. We also want to make sure you're getting enough rest and maintaining a healthy diet. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and develop a treatment plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, two weeks sounds good. I’ll make a note of it. Staying active… I can do that. I like to walk, when I can. And Leilani makes sure I eat right, so that’s taken care of. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel… less worried, to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I’m glad I could ease some of your worries. It's important to remember that MS is a chronic condition, and there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms and slow its progression. I’ll have the nurse give you the lab requisition forms and schedule the MRI for you. Also, I'll send a referral to neurology. It's important to have a specialist involved in your care. Do you have any questions for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very well. Leilani will probably have a list of questions, but… for now, I don’t. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. And for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Asthore. I'm happy to help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and I’ll see you in two weeks. And give my best to Leilani.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day too.
