DOCTOR: Alright. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Pehrson, it’s… complicated. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is as it should be, you understand. A woman of my… standing needs to be prudent.
DOCTOR: Right. “Prudent.” Okay. So, is this a… new relationship?
PATIENT: New-ish. We’ve been seeing each other for… three months, give or take. And honestly, Doctor, it feels longer. Which is precisely why I’m here. One simply doesn't rush into things. It's about being responsible, isn't it? I want to be sure he’s responsible, too.
DOCTOR: Look, are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, no, nothing like that. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you. I mean, I take my vitamins. No, it’s not about me being sick. It's about… assurances. Knowing things are… proper. And frankly, I’d feel better if we ran some tests. Just to be safe. You do run tests, don’t you, Doctor? For… compatibility, shall we say?
DOCTOR: “Compatibility”?
PATIENT: Yes. You know… making sure everything is… functioning as it should. Before things… progress. A gentleman’s health, and all that. It’s a very common precaution, isn’t it? I read about it in a magazine. A very reputable magazine, I assure you. Are you familiar with Town & Country?
DOCTOR: Medicare… right. Look, I’m a family doctor. I deal with things like colds, flu, high blood pressure… not… relationship checks. We can do a standard checkup, blood work, make sure there aren't any underlying issues. But I don’t offer… “compatibility testing.” Is there anything specific you’re concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. So this is the standard of care these days? I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Very well. If you insist on being difficult, a complete physical will have to do. Though I’m not sure what good that will be if you’re not looking for… the things that truly matter. But, yes. A complete physical. And I would like a full STI screening, just to be on the safe side. One can never be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure, heart rate, lungs… standard stuff. And the STI panel. Fine. Let's start with your weight and height. Step on the scale, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’d prefer if you didn’t announce the numbers aloud. It’s simply… uncouth. Though I suppose it's unavoidable. Do hurry, though. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Is everything alright? You seem rather… rushed. A proper examination requires a certain level of… thoroughness, wouldn't you agree? One must listen carefully, really listen.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure was 130 over 80. Anything you want to tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, really? That's… adequate, I suppose. As for my medical history… well, I've always been quite healthy, thank you. A touch of seasonal allergies, but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And I've been a member of the Ladies Auxiliary for years, so I have regular check-ups. But truly, Doctor, nothing of any consequence. Unless you're interested in my great-aunt Mildred’s bout with shingles? It was quite dramatic. Though I doubt it’s relevant. Are you certain you can’t just run a general panel? For… peace of mind?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're anxious, but I need to focus on things that will actually tell me something about your health. Shingles and tonsils aren't relevant. We’ve established you're generally healthy. The STI screening will take some time to come back. Anything else?
PATIENT: Honestly, the dismissive attitude is rather disconcerting. Very well. If you insist on being so… clinical, I suppose I should mention my occasional bouts of insomnia. It’s likely due to stress. And sometimes I have a bit of… indigestion. Though I attribute that to rich foods. But beyond that, I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. Though I do take a daily multivitamin. And a calcium supplement. Are you certain this is sufficient? Perhaps you could order a full thyroid panel? Just to be on the safe side. A friend of mine… well, it’s a long story. But it involved fatigue and… weight gain. It’s best to be thorough, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. Insomnia, indigestion, multivitamin, calcium. I'll order a basic metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. That’s the extent of it. Anything else before I let the lab draw your blood?
PATIENT: Well… there is one small thing. It’s rather… personal. I’ve noticed a slight… change in my… olfactory sense. It’s difficult to explain. My sense of smell hasn't been quite as… discerning lately. It's probably nothing. But it occurred to me that it could be a sign of… something. Perhaps a hormonal imbalance? It’s just… worrisome. A woman relies on her instincts, you know. And my instincts are telling me something isn’t quite right. Could you perhaps add a hormone panel? Just to rule things out? It’s better to be safe than sorry, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m ordering a basic set of tests. I’m not going to run a full hormone panel based on a vague change in your sense of smell. That’s not medically indicated. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medically indicated? Honestly! I am the patient, and I am expressing my concerns. Are you suggesting I don’t know my own body? Very well. If you refuse to listen, so be it. But do not blame me if something… untoward happens. As for allergies… I believe I had a mild reaction to penicillin as a child. A small rash, nothing serious. But I am generally cautious with medications. And I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though, frankly, I doubt they’d be sufficient in this case. Are you absolutely certain you can’t just run the hormone panel? For peace of mind? It’s a simple test! And I’m paying for it!
DOCTOR: . Look, I understand you’re anxious, but this is ridiculous. I’ve offered a standard set of tests based on your limited complaints. I’m not going to order a battery of unnecessary tests just to appease your anxieties. If you’re not satisfied with my care, you’re welcome to seek a second opinion. The lab is down the hall. I'll have a nurse draw the blood. Good day.
PATIENT: Well! I have never been treated with such disrespect! Honestly, the audacity! Fine. I shall find another doctor. One who actually listens to their patients. And I shall be sure to tell all my friends about this… appalling experience. Good day to you, Doctor.
