DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Giganti. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card... a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, Uber and things like that. It’s a bit of a hassle, but it needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, a commercial driver’s medical certificate. That requires a Department of Transportation physical exam. I'm happy to help with that. To start, let’s go over your medical history to ensure you meet the requirements. First, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health... well, I’m 70, so things aren’t perfect. But I’m still working, you know? I operate logging equipment. It keeps me busy. I've had a few aches and pains, naturally, but nothing that stops me. I had my gallbladder removed… oh, must have been fifteen years ago now. And a knee replacement about ten years ago, on my right side. Does that matter? I try to stay active.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, San. Yes, the gallbladder removal and the knee replacement are important to note. Fifteen and ten years ago, respectively, is good information. And it's excellent that you remain active. To clarify, do you experience any pain related to your knee replacement currently?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More like… a stiffness, especially if it’s cold. Or if I’ve been sitting for a long time. But a little walking gets it moving again. I can still get in and out of the equipment just fine. It doesn’t bother me enough to stop working, if that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Stiffness is common after a knee replacement, especially with changes in weather or prolonged sitting. So it doesn't limit your ability to perform your work duties?
PATIENT: No, it doesn’t. I’ve adjusted, you see? I take breaks, stretch a little, and it's manageable. Honestly, Doctor, the equipment is harder on my back than my knee these days! But I’m careful. I’ve been doing this a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve developed good coping mechanisms. Back pain is certainly common with that type of work. Let's make sure we document that as well. Now, regarding your overall health, do you have any current medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. I take medication for it. Been on it for… oh, maybe eight years now? My regular doctor handles that. No diabetes, thankfully. And no heart problems that I know of. I get a check-up once a year, and they haven’t said anything about my heart. I can give you my doctor's name if you need it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That's helpful. Having a list of your current medications would be beneficial. Do you happen to have that with you, or can you recall what you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I think so… let me see… It’s Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, if my pressure is still high, my regular doctor has me take a water pill with it. Hydrochlorothiazide, I think it’s called. 25 milligrams. I usually have it at home, but I didn't think to bring a list.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily and Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg as needed. That's good information. Do you experience any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything… never had a reaction. I can't say for sure about every single thing, but I'm pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had heart trouble, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had a stroke, I believe. Both of them lived into their eighties, though. On my side, not much cancer, thankfully. My brother had some skin cancer, but they caught it early. Nothing too serious, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart disease in your mother and stroke in your father. And skin cancer in your brother. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. Well, I’m divorced. Been divorced a long time now. No children. I live alone. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I enjoy gardening, mostly. And, of course, my work. It keeps me busy. Is that what you needed to know? I’m not much for socializing, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, San. It’s good to know you don't drink or smoke, and that you’re active with your work and gardening. That’s all very helpful. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam for the DOT certification, do you have any current symptoms or concerns you want to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, but that's just from the work, I think. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… Nothing major. I just want to get this card and keep working. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about failing the exam and not being able to drive. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, San. Let's take things one step at a time. We’ll perform the DOT physical exam, and I will document everything thoroughly. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please remove your jacket and sit comfortably.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Just let me know if anything seems wrong, okay? I’ve had my blood pressure taken a million times, but I always get a little nervous at the doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, your blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal; lungs are clear. I’m just documenting these findings. Now, I'm going to check your vision. Can you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Okay. 148/82… that’s a bit high, isn’t it? Yes, alright. Let me see… Um… E, F, P, T… Is that right? I think so. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, your vision is 20/30 in both eyes. That’s a little below the standard for a commercial driver’s license, but we can address that. Now, let’s check your reflexes and strength. Please extend your arms, and I’ll test your reflexes with this small hammer.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. This always feels weird. I don't know why. It just… feels strange. Is that okay? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, San. Your reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally. Now, I'll check your strength by asking you to squeeze my hands and push against my resistance. Squeeze my hands as tightly as you can… and now, push against my hands… that's good. Now the other side…
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I try to do what you say. My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be, from the logging equipment, maybe. It’s a different kind of strength, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, your strength is good, a little diminished in both hands, as you said, but within acceptable limits. Now, let's quickly check your range of motion in your neck, shoulders, and back. Please turn your head to the left… and now to the right… good. Now, bend forward… and back… that's good. Now, bend to the sides…
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little stiff. My back doesn’t like that. But I can do it. Is that okay? It just feels a little creaky. I told you, the logging equipment isn’t kind to my back.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a little limited range of motion in your lower back, but nothing alarming. We will document that. Finally, I need to take a quick listen to your heart and lungs again. Take a deep breath in… and out… and another deep breath… good. Everything sounds normal. Now, do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been careful with what I eat, and thankfully, my blood sugar has always been fine. I worry about it, though. My mother had trouble with her feet, and I hear that's from diabetes. But I’ve never been diagnosed.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, San. Everything appears to be within acceptable limits for a DOT physical exam, however your blood pressure is a little elevated. We need to recheck that before we can finalize the certification. We’ll take it again in a few minutes after you’ve had a chance to rest. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A few minutes rest, okay. That’s good. Will that high blood pressure be a problem? I really need this card, Doctor. And… what if I fail? What happens then? Can I try again? I just… I don't want to lose my job over this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, San. We’ll take the blood pressure again in a few minutes, and hopefully, it will be lower. Many times, a single reading can be elevated due to anxiety or temporary factors. If your blood pressure remains high, we can explore options like a 24-hour blood pressure monitor or a referral to your primary care physician for further evaluation. You are allowed a limited number of retries, but it’s always best to address the underlying cause if possible. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, that sounds… reasonable. A 24-hour monitor… I don't know. That sounds like a lot of work. Alright. A few minutes, then another reading. I hope it’s better. I really, really do. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, San. Take a few deep breaths and try to relax. I'll be right back to recheck your blood pressure in about five minutes.
