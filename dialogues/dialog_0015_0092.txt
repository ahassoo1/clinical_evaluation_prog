DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Trestrail. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Guilds is the name. This… this breathing, see? It’s gettin’ harder. And my mouth… feels like the desert. Eyes too, all scratchy. It ain’t been good. Don't remember when it started, exactly. Just… slow. Like a leaky faucet, gettin' worse and worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. "Slow, like a leaky faucet, getting worse and worse" – I appreciate you describing it that way. So, it's primarily shortness of breath and dryness – mouth and eyes, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Shortness of breath… and the dryness. Like I said, feels like sand. Used to be, I could drink a glass of water and feel alright. Now? Barely helps. And the eyes… gotta blink all the time. It’s annoying, really. Not… not a good feelin’. You understand? It just… is.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Guilds. It sounds quite uncomfortable. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this. When you say the shortness of breath is getting worse, can you tell me when you notice it most?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, you say? Well… walkin’ up the stairs, for sure. Always used to be able to bound up 'em. Not now. And… when I try to… what’s it called… garden? Yeah, gardenin’. Used to love it. Now, I gotta stop and rest. And… sometimes, even just talkin'. Like now, actually. Gotta take a breath between words. Don’t remember it bein’ this bad before, though. Old age, I guess. What do you think?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're noticing these changes, Mr. Guilds. It's important to investigate, regardless of age. You mentioned gardening and walking up stairs. Is the shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Not all the time. When I'm sittin'… watchin’ the TV… usually okay. But as soon as I do somethin'? That’s when it starts. And… sometimes at night. Woke up a couple of times, feelin' like I couldn't get enough air. Scared me a little, to be honest. Used to be a strong man, you know? Now… feelin’ kinda weak. But don’t make too much of it. Probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you wake up at night feeling short of breath, does anything relieve it?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Hmm… usually just… sittin’ up. Prop myself up with pillows. That helps a little. And… I try to think about somethin’ else. Distract myself. It don’t fix it, but it makes it… less bad. Don't know if that makes sense. Used to be able to handle anything, you know? Now… little things bother me. This breathin', mostly. And the dryness. Like a desert in my mouth, I tell ya. Never been this dry before. I really don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… Let me think. I ain’t looked at my feet in a while, to be honest. Too much trouble bendin' down. But… I think… maybe? My shoes feel a little tighter than usual, now that you mention it. But I put on a little weight, maybe that's it. I like my food, you know? But… yeah, maybe a little swelling. Not much, though. Just a little. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're observant, Mr. Guilds. That could be relevant. Let's do a quick examination. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your feet and ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Don't know what you're lookin' for, but… whatever you need. Just try to be quick, huh? My bones ain't what they used to be. And… don't be surprised if I complain a little. Old habits, you know. Used to be in charge, always tellin' people what to do. But you're the doctor, I guess. Do what you gotta do. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Okay. And your blood pressure is 148/86, and your pulse is 82. I’m noting some swelling in your ankles, and when I listen to your lungs, I hear some crackling sounds. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm hearing and feeling now, it could be a number of things, but it sounds like you might be retaining some fluid, and it’s impacting your breathing. I want to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Sounds… serious. What are you lookin' for? Fluid, you say? Where's the fluid from? I don’t like the sound of fluid. I ain't been drinkin' too much, I promise ya. Always just a little beer with dinner. Is it… bad? Look, Doctor, I just want to be able to breathe again, and get rid of this dryness. Is that too much to ask? I've lived a long life, but I ain't ready to… well, you know. Just tell me what's goin' on, in plain English, huh? No fancy words. And… will these tests hurt?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds, let’s take things slowly. The tests aren’t meant to scare you, they’re simply to help us understand what’s causing your shortness of breath and dryness. The X-ray is a picture of your lungs, it won't hurt at all, you just stand still for a moment. The blood work involves a small sample of blood, and a slight pinch, but that's it. The fluid could be coming from a number of things – sometimes it’s related to the heart, sometimes the kidneys, and sometimes other issues. It’s not necessarily from drinking too much – it just means there’s extra fluid in your body that’s affecting your breathing and causing the swelling in your ankles. We need to rule out certain things to find the root cause, and these tests will help us do that. I want to be thorough, so we can get you feeling better. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… thorough, you say? Alright. I guess so. I always liked people who were thorough. My father… he was a carpenter. Best carpenter in Cuba. Always took his time, made sure everything was perfect. So, no pain? Just a picture and a pinch? And you're just lookin' for… fluid? And what then? What happens after the tests? Will I get a shot? I don’t like needles. But… if it's gonna help me breathe, I guess I can handle it. Just… tell me what to expect, okay? No surprises. And… how long will these tests take? I got a TV show I like to watch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. No surprises, I promise. The X-ray will take about five minutes, and the blood work about ten. We’ll send the blood sample to the lab, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. As for a shot, not necessarily. It depends on what the results show. If it's related to fluid retention, we might need to give you a medication to help your body get rid of it. If it's something else, we’ll discuss other options. I'll explain everything clearly when the results come back, and we’ll work together to find the best solution. We might need to consult with a specialist – perhaps a cardiologist or a nephrologist – depending on the results, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let's just focus on getting these tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Tests it is. Cardiologist, you say? Fancy words. But… I trust you, Doctor. You seem thorough. And I appreciate you explainin’ things. My wife… she always said I liked to know what was goin’ on. So, where do we start? You said a picture first? And… no surprises? Really? Because I don’t do well with surprises. Especially at my age. Just… get it over with, huh? Let's get this picture taken, and then the pinch. Then I can go home and watch my show. Is that too much to ask? A little peace and quiet… and to breathe again. That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. No surprises, I promise. Let's get you to radiology for the X-ray first. I'll have my nurse, Maria, come with you to make sure you’re comfortable. She’ll explain the process. It’s just a quick picture. Then we’ll come back and do the blood work. It’s just a small sample, and it’ll be over before you know it. And then, hopefully, you’ll be able to go home and enjoy your show. We’ll do everything we can to get you breathing easier, Mr. Guilds. Let’s go get started. Maria will be right with you.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Lead the way. And tell Maria to be gentle. My bones ain't what they used to be, you know? And… make sure they don’t take too long. That show starts at eight. Important show, you know. About detectives. Good detectives. So… let’s go. Before I change my mind. And… please, no surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. No surprises. I'll let Maria know to be gentle and to expedite the process. Let's go.
PATIENT: .
