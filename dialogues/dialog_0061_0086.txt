DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Kahrin. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hi Dr. Kimm. Just the results, please. I'm pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. I understand you're short on time. Let me pull up your results here... Just give me one moment. It looks like we ran a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Are you aware of what those tests were for, or would you like me to quickly explain them?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not really. I just said yes to whatever the nurse suggested. Can you just tell me if everything's okay? Like, is there anything wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, fair enough. No worries at all. Let's go through this together. Your complete blood count was entirely normal – that's good, it rules out any infection or major blood disorders. Your metabolic panel was also within normal limits – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – everything looks healthy there. Now, your thyroid stimulating hormone… that was slightly elevated. It’s not dramatically high, but it is enough that we should talk about it. Do you have any idea what the thyroid is or what it does?
PATIENT: Uh… something to do with your neck? I think I remember hearing about it somewhere. But I don’t know what it does, exactly. Is it bad that it’s a bit high? Like, is this going to need… medication or something? I really don’t have time for a lot of appointments.
DOCTOR: You’re right, the thyroid is in your neck. It makes hormones that control your metabolism – basically, how your body uses energy. When it’s slightly elevated like yours is, it often means your thyroid isn’t working as efficiently as it should. It's called hypothyroidism. It can require medication, yes, but it's also very manageable with a daily pill. It usually improves energy levels and overall well-being quite a bit. Before we jump to medication, though, I’d like to get a little more information, just to be sure. Have you been feeling more tired lately?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I've been really dragging, even after a full night's sleep. I figured it was just work stress, honestly. Everything's been crazy busy with shipping delays and… well, everything. I also feel colder than usual, even in the office. Is that… related?
DOCTOR: Okay, that definitely fits with hypothyroidism. Fatigue and feeling cold are common symptoms. Do you notice any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My skin's been really dry lately, almost flaky. And… I think I've been a little more forgetful than usual, which is saying something, even for me. I usually remember everything, but I've been misplacing things and… just generally feeling a bit foggy. It's not huge, but it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kahrin, those are all symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism as well. The dry skin and forgetfulness especially. We should confirm this with a bit more testing. I'd like to check your T4 levels – that's another thyroid hormone – and also do a thyroid antibody test to see if it’s an autoimmune issue. Would you be able to spare about 30 minutes for another blood draw?
PATIENT: Ugh. Another blood draw? Seriously? Okay, fine. But can we do it first thing in the morning? I have a shipment leaving at 2pm and I need to be there to oversee it. And can you promise me this will be the last one? I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can schedule it for first thing in the morning. And I promise, if this test confirms the hypothyroidism, it will be the last blood draw for now. We'll just need to monitor your levels with a simple blood test every six months or so once you’re on medication. Let me go ahead and get that scheduled for you. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to stay as natural as possible. Just lots of water. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while back. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No current medications, vitamins or supplements. That's helpful. And it's not a problem that you stopped the multivitamin, just good to know. Now, do you have any family history of thyroid problems, autoimmune diseases, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had something with her thyroid, I think. But I don’t know what it was exactly. She lived in Tahiti, and they didn’t really have much in the way of doctors back then. She was always tired, though. And my aunt… she had some sort of allergy thing, really bad skin rash, but that’s it, really. Nothing major. Is that useful? I'm not really sure how far back I can go.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful actually. A family history of thyroid issues and autoimmune conditions does increase your risk. So, based on your symptoms, your test results, and your family history, it's looking more and more like hypothyroidism. Once we confirm with the additional testing, we can discuss treatment options. The most common is a synthetic thyroid hormone called levothyroxine. It’s a daily pill, usually taken in the morning on an empty stomach. It’s very effective, and most people feel much better within a few weeks of starting it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A pill sounds… manageable. As long as it doesn't have a ton of side effects. And it won't interfere with my work, right? I have a lot on my plate. So, when can I get this other test done? I really need to know one way or the other, and quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Levothyroxine has very few side effects when started at the correct dose, and they're usually mild, like a little nervousness or some changes in appetite. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your levels closely. And it shouldn’t interfere with your work at all, especially once we get the dosage right. We can get that blood draw done first thing tomorrow morning, like we discussed. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, is there anything else you're concerned about today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… please make sure they call me quickly. I really need to get this sorted out. Thank you, Dr. Kimm. I appreciate you trying to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kahrin. I understand your urgency, and I'll make sure my nurse prioritizes getting those results to you as soon as they're available. We'll get this figured out. Have a good evening, and I’ll see you tomorrow. .
