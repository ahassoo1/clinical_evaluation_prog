DOCTOR: Hi Nadene, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, maybe a month now? And my heart… it feels a bit funny sometimes with it. Not bad bad, but…fluttery.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for about a month, and some heart fluttering. Got it. Let’s start with the cough. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s mostly dry, you know? Not much… well, hardly any phlegm at all. It’s worse at night, usually. Keeps me up sometimes. And when I lie flat, it feels… heavier, like something’s pressing on my chest. I have to sleep propped up with pillows. It’s just… tiring, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry cough, worse at night and when lying flat, relieved somewhat by propping up with pillows. That gives me a few ideas. And you said it’s been about a month?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer? It started gradually, you know, just a little tickle in my throat. I didn’t think much of it at first. Just figured it was a bit of a cold. But it hasn’t gone away like a normal cold would. It's still bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started as a mild tickle and gradually worsened over a month. And you haven’t had any fever, chills, or body aches with it?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Not that I've noticed, anyway. And no aches, no. Just… the cough, and the feeling in my chest. Sometimes I get a little short of breath when I walk, but I thought that was just getting old! I used to be able to walk miles, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or body aches. Shortness of breath with walking…and you've noticed that's getting worse?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not dramatically, but… I have to stop and catch my breath more often than I used to. Even going to the market, which isn’t far, leaves me a little winded. It’s probably just age, like I said. But it’s good to get it checked, just in case.
DOCTOR: Right, it's good you came in. Now, let's talk about that heart fluttering you mentioned. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not painful, not at all. It just feels like…like a little bird flapping around in my chest sometimes. It doesn’t happen all the time, just every now and then. And it usually happens when I’m trying to fall asleep, or when I’ve been walking. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds usually. But it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brief fluttering sensation in your chest, not painful, happening with activity or when trying to fall asleep. Does anything seem to trigger it, besides activity and lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think. I don't know if anything specifically triggers it. Maybe if I eat something heavy? Sometimes I feel it a little after a big meal. But I’m not sure. It's hard to say for sure. I haven’t really paid close attention, I guess. I just feel it, and then it goes away. It hasn’t been bad enough to really worry about, until now with the cough, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly related to eating a heavy meal. Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh yes! Now that you mention it... my ankles have been a bit puffy lately. I thought it was just the heat, you know? It's been so warm. But they're definitely a little bigger than usual. And sometimes, when I press on them, it leaves a little dent that stays for a while. It doesn’t hurt, just… puffy. I wear sandals most of the time, so it wasn’t very noticeable at first.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy ankles with some indentation when pressed. Good to know. Let me just take a look at your chart here... I see you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication. And you had a gallbladder removal several years ago. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, I have congestive heart failure, as well. It's been…well, it's been a while since they told me. Maybe ten years ago? I take a water pill for it, and something else… let me see… oh, Lisinopril, I think. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just an old age thing. I think that's everything. Doctor Ramirez was my doctor before she retired. She was very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of congestive heart failure and arthritis. You’re on Lisinopril and a water pill. Alright, Nadene, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your ankles to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. My heart does sometimes feel a little funny, so I’m glad you’re listening.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds a bit irregular, and I can hear some crackles in your lungs, especially at the bases. Your ankles do have significant edema – swelling. Capillary refill is a little slow. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and also some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP to check for heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you need to do, go ahead. I just want to feel better. A chest X-ray and blood work… and that EKG thing. I’m not sure what that is, but if it helps, then yes, do it. Is it painful? The blood work, I mean. I don’t like needles very much. But I understand you have to do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: No, the EKG isn’t painful at all. It’s just stickers that we put on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And the blood work… well, there’s a little pinch, but it’s very quick. We’ll send you to the lab right down the hall. It shouldn’t take too long. While we’re waiting for those results, I’m going to adjust your current medications slightly. I’m going to increase the dose of your water pill to help with the swelling, and I’m going to add a low dose of a medication called furosemide to help get rid of some of the fluid in your lungs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… increasing the water pill and adding that other medication, furosemide. Is that going to make me have to go to the bathroom more often? Because I already go quite a bit as it is! I don’t want to be stuck in the bathroom all day. But if it helps my breathing… then yes, go ahead. Just… please tell me if it’s a lot more.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will likely need to go to the bathroom more frequently with the increased dose of the water pill and the addition of furosemide. It’s a common side effect. We’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I’ll also give you some instructions on monitoring your weight daily and watching for any symptoms to worsen, like increased shortness of breath or swelling. I want you to call the office right away if you notice any changes. Do you have someone who can help you monitor you at home?
PATIENT: Yes, my daughter, Elena, comes to visit most days. She helps me with things, and she's very good about noticing when I'm not feeling well. She can definitely help me keep track of my weight and watch for changes. She worries about me, you know. So, she can help. That’s good. What weight should I be looking for, if I start to get too heavy?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you have support. We want to keep your weight stable. Any increase of 2-3 pounds in a day, or 5 pounds in a week, is something to call us about. We’re looking for fluid retention, which can be a sign of worsening heart failure. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I also want you to follow a low-sodium diet. That will help reduce fluid retention as well. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Low sodium… oh dear. I love my little bit of salt on my food! It doesn't taste right without it. I try to be careful, but… it’s hard. What exactly does low sodium mean? Can I still have my coffee with a little bit of milk? And what about… It’s just… I like my food.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not about completely eliminating salt, just reducing it. We want to keep it under 2000 milligrams a day. You can still have your coffee with a little bit of milk – that’s perfectly fine. It’s things like processed foods, canned soups, and salty snacks that we need to be careful with. I can give you a handout with a list of low-sodium foods and some tips for reducing salt in your diet. And our nutritionist, Maria, is excellent. She can help you create a meal plan that’s both healthy and tasty. Would you be interested in scheduling an appointment with her?
PATIENT: Oh, a handout would be wonderful! Yes, please. And… yes, a nutritionist would be good. Elena keeps telling me I need to eat better, but I don’t know where to start. Maria, you say? Yes, that sounds good. A meal plan… something to help me figure it out. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so clearly. I’m still worried, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. That's my job. The lab results are starting to come in. Your chest X-ray shows some fluid in your lungs, consistent with congestive heart failure. Your EKG shows an irregular heartbeat. Your BNP level is elevated, which confirms the heart failure. Based on these results, we’re going to continue to manage your congestive heart failure with the medication adjustments we discussed. We’ll also monitor your symptoms closely. I want you to call us immediately if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling in your ankles or feet, or dizziness. Do you have any questions about these results?
PATIENT: Fluid in my lungs… and my heart isn’t beating right. That’s… scary. So, the medicine should help with the fluid? And you said you’ll keep an eye on me? Will I have to come back for more tests? And what about… will this get worse? I just want to be able to breathe again. And not feel so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, the medicine should help reduce the fluid in your lungs and improve your breathing. We’ll start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. And yes, we’ll need to monitor you closely. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check your progress and repeat some of the blood work. We’ll also likely need to do an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart – to get a better look at its structure and function. As for whether it will get worse… congestive heart failure is a chronic condition, meaning it’s long-term. It can fluctuate, meaning there will be times when you feel better and times when you feel worse. But with proper management – medication, lifestyle changes, and close monitoring – we can help control your symptoms and improve your quality of life. It’s important to remember that you’re not alone in this. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And you explained everything so clearly. I feel… a little better knowing what’s going on. And knowing that you’re here to help. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. And I’ll schedule that follow-up appointment.
