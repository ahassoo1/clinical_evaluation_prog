DOCTOR: Hello Kerriann, welcome! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Maskal, it’s nice to meet you too. Um, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I’ve noticed a change in how I smell, you know? My body odor. It’s different than it used to be, and it’s… worrying me. I haven’t changed anything – soaps, deodorant, diet, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about a change like that, and you're right to bring it up. It's good you haven’t changed anything recently – that helps us narrow things down. Can you describe what’s different about the odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. It’s not… stronger, exactly. More… musky? Like a slightly stale smell, I guess. It's not like the usual sweat smell, it’s… harder to explain. And it seems to be all over, not just my armpits. Like even after a shower, I can still kind of smell it. Does that make sense? I feel silly trying to describe a smell!
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Kerriann, don’t feel silly at all! Describing smells is difficult. "Musky" and "stale" are good descriptors, and the fact that it persists even after showering is definitely something we need to investigate. It’s good you’re noticing it all over, not just in typical areas. To get a better understanding, can you tell me if you've noticed any other changes alongside this, like changes in your skin, any new rashes, or even just feeling warmer or colder than usual?
PATIENT: Let me think… No rashes, definitely not. My skin feels normal, maybe a little drier than usual now that I think about it, but that could just be the summer. And, um… actually, yes. I have been feeling warmer, even when it’s not that hot outside. Like, just generally flushed, especially in my face and neck. Not a fever, I don’t feel sick, just… warmer than I used to be. And I’ve been sleeping through the night a little more… restlessly, if that makes sense. Waking up sweaty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Kerriann. The drier skin and the feeling of being warmer, especially with the restless sleep and waking up sweaty, are all things that can be related. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Um, let’s see. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been pretty well controlled with medication – I take lisinopril, 20 milligrams every day. Other than that… no, not really. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago and hasn’t caused any problems since. Nothing else that I know of. I had a pretty regular checkup with my previous doctor last year, and everything was normal then. I switched doctors because he retired.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the high blood pressure and that it’s controlled with lisinopril. And the gallbladder removal is noted. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. One of those cheap ones from the drugstore, nothing fancy. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but not very often – maybe once a month, if that. I don’t really like taking pills unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m pretty lucky, I don’t have any major allergies. I get hay fever sometimes in the spring, but that’s it. Just a little sneezing and a runny nose. No food allergies, no reactions to any medications that I know of. I've never had anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – with any medical conditions like diabetes, thyroid problems, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had it for a long time before she passed away. And my grandmother on my father’s side… she had a thyroid problem, I think? Something with it being overactive, but I don’t remember the details. My father was generally healthy, though, as far as I know. No kidney problems on either side of the family, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important to know, Kerriann – the family history of diabetes and thyroid issues. Finally, I'm going to ask a few social history questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t had alcohol in several years now. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I work hard, that’s my recreation! Mostly I just like gardening and spending time with my grandkids.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Kerriann. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature, and I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to take a quick look at your skin to see if there are any visible changes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Sounds good. I’m ready whenever you are. I figured I'd be getting checked out, so I made sure I wasn’t wearing anything too… complicated.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m noting some mild flushing of your skin, especially on your face and neck, and your skin feels slightly warm and dry to the touch. No visible rashes or lesions. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, the change in body odor, along with the flushing, restless sleep, and your family history, raises a few possibilities. One possibility is menopause, but we need to rule out other conditions first. Given your mother’s history of diabetes, we should check your blood sugar levels. Also, the thyroid could be playing a role. I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a hemoglobin A1c to check your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. I'm glad you're thinking about all those possibilities. My periods have been a bit irregular lately, so menopause isn’t entirely surprising, but it’s good to rule other things out, especially with my mother's diabetes. Blood tests sound fine. Where will I get those done? And will you give me a paper to take with me? I tend to forget things, even important things!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kerriann. I completely understand. I'm happy to provide you with a printed requisition form. Here you are. You can get the blood tests done at any Quest Diagnostics lab, or at most major hospital labs. I’m also going to send the order electronically to the lab closest to your home address, just in case that’s easier. We'll get the results back in about 3-5 business days. Once I have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms – such as unexplained weight loss, increased thirst, frequent urination, or any significant changes in your energy levels – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Sending the order electronically is a huge help, thank you! And I appreciate you telling me what to look out for. I’ll definitely call if anything changes. I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much, Dr. Maskal. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're here to partner with you in your healthcare. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns, even small ones. Have a good day, and I'll see you when the lab results are back. .
