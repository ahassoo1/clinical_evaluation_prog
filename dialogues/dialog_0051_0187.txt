DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Look, I don't have all day. Chest… feels funny. And my heart, it flutters. Like bird. Also, nurse took my blood pressure, and she said it was… high. I don't like it. Waste of my time, this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Chest feels funny” and a fluttering heart – and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. Thank you for telling me. When did you first notice this feeling in your chest, and could you describe what "funny" feels like?
PATIENT: A few days, maybe. Not sure exactly. Old man, I forget. Funny… like tightness. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Like someone sitting on my chest. And the fluttering... it comes and goes. Makes me nervous. Is it serious? I have things to do, you know. Don’t have time for… problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in your chest, not a sharp pain, more uncomfortable... and the fluttering sensation comes and goes. I understand your concern, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I appreciate you letting me know how this is affecting you. It's good you’re paying attention to these changes. To get a better understanding, have you noticed anything that triggers this feeling – anything you’re doing when it starts, or anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmph. I live my life. I eat, I sleep, I watch TV. Sometimes garden. Don't see how that matters. Maybe… maybe after I climb stairs. Little bit of effort, you know? But I’ve climbed stairs my whole life. Don’t think it’s that. Everything feels harder now, though. Getting old is a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it seems to happen sometimes with activity, like climbing stairs, and you’ve noticed things generally feel more difficult as you get older. That's helpful information, thank you. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with this – any shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, or pain in your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: No. No dizziness. Sweating? Maybe a little in the summer, but who doesn’t? And no pain anywhere else. Just… this. In the chest. This fluttering. I don't need a lot of tests, doctor. I know my body. It’s just… old. I need a quick answer, not a whole week of appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, no pain in your arms or jaw, just the chest discomfort and fluttering. I appreciate you telling me that. And I understand you'd like to avoid a lot of tests if possible, and want answers quickly. Mr. Sobkowicz, to get a better sense of what's going on, I would like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your pulse. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. But don't keep me long. I have… things to do. And don't tell me to exercise more. I already do enough.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long at all. Okay. I’m listening now. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and your pulse is a bit weak. Your lungs sound clear, though. I'm also going to take your blood pressure again, just to confirm what the nurse said. Your blood pressure is 150 over 90. That is elevated. I want to be thorough, Mr. Sobkowicz, so I'm going to order a quick EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – to get a better look at your heart's electrical activity. It’s a simple test, just some stickers on your chest. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Stickers? Hmph. More tests. Fine. But if it's just going to tell me I’m old, I don’t want it. And make it quick. I’m waiting. Don’t bother me with small talk, either. Just get it done. This is a waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the technician come in to do the EKG right away. It will only take a few minutes, and we'll have the results shortly. Just lie back on the exam table, and they will place the stickers on your chest. While we are waiting, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… I take something for my… water retention. My legs swell, you know? Small blue pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take something… white, I think. Small one. That's it. Don't need a lot of drugs. They just make me feel… foggy. Don't write down a whole list. That’s all. And hurry with those stickers.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blue pill for swelling in your legs, and a white pill occasionally for sleep. We’ll make a note of those. The technician will let me know as soon as the EKG is complete. While we wait, is there anyone who can help you get home, should you feel unwell?
PATIENT: Hmph. My wife. She drives. But I don't feel unwell. Just… annoyed. Get this over with. I have gardening to do. Tomatoes are ripening, you know. Don’t need them to rot. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, we are getting the EKG now. Okay. I have the results of the EKG. It shows an irregular heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. This can cause symptoms like the fluttering you're experiencing, and can also increase the risk of stroke. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean anything drastic, but it does need to be addressed. I would like to discuss some options with you, including medication to help regulate your heart rhythm and prevent stroke. I'd also like to refer you to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation and management. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Stroke? Medication? Specialist? This is what I was afraid of. All this… for a little fluttering? I don't want a lot of pills. I want to be left alone. No. No pills. No specialist. I’ll just… try to relax. And you, doctor, don't bother me with more tests. I'm not going through with all this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your reluctance. I truly do. And I respect your decision. However, I am obligated to inform you that atrial fibrillation, if left untreated, can significantly increase your risk of stroke, which can cause serious disability or even death. While I won't force you to take medication or see a specialist, I strongly recommend reconsidering. I can provide you with written information about atrial fibrillation, its risks, and the benefits of treatment, so you can make an informed decision. Even if you choose not to pursue treatment at this time, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or two to check in and see how you are doing. Would that be acceptable?
