DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, welcome. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… my joints, mostly. They feel… stiff in the mornings. It’s been going on a while now, I think. Not awful, just… bothersome. I forget how long exactly, though. It feels like always, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Always” can be a long time! Okay, so stiffness in your joints, particularly in the mornings. That's a good place to start. Can you tell me which joints are bothering you the most?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My hands, definitely. And my knees… yes, my knees are trouble when I first get up. Sometimes my back too, but I think that’s just… old age, probably. I don't really pay attention. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, if you know what I mean. I just know it’s harder to get going in the mornings than it used to be.
DOCTOR: I do understand – it’s common for things to feel a bit fuzzy when it’s been going on for a while. Okay, so hands, knees, and sometimes your back, with the stiffness being worse in the mornings. Is the stiffness the main problem, or do you also have pain with those joints?
PATIENT: Oh, there’s a little pain, yes. Not sharp, not like a bad injury. Just… achey. It’s more the stiffness, though. Like they need oiling or something. It’s hard to make a fist with my hands sometimes, and getting up from a chair… well, that’s a project. Not terrible, but noticeable. It's… frustrating, mostly. I used to be able to do so much more.
DOCTOR: Okay, achey pain and stiffness in your hands and knees, making it difficult to make a fist and get up from a chair. And it’s impacting your daily activities. That's helpful to know. Before we go further, can you tell me if this is happening in both hands and both knees, or just one of each?
PATIENT: Oh… good question. I think… both, yes. Both hands are stiff, and both knees too. Not exactly the same, maybe one is a little worse than the other on some days, but yes, both. It’s hard to remember which one is doing what sometimes. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all! You’re doing great. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details, especially when it’s been going on for a while. Both hands and both knees – that's good information. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't really looked closely, if I'm honest. Redness… no, I don't recall any redness. They just… feel old, I guess. I mostly just try to ignore it and keep moving. It doesn’t look different, if that makes sense. I'm not sure I would notice swelling anyway. I don't check them very often.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Okay, no noticeable swelling or redness. Now, let’s talk a little bit about other things going on. Have you had any fever, fatigue, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I haven't felt hot or anything. Fatigue… well, I am always a little tired, but I figure that’s just getting older. I don't know if it’s more tired than usual. Weight loss… no, I don’t think so. Maybe a little, but I haven't been weighing myself. Everything feels a bit… normal, except for the joints, really. I mostly just garden and keep house. Not much energy for much else these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no significant fatigue or weight loss. Just the joint stiffness and acheiness. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask some questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, lupus, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a hard one. Let me think… I was married a long time, my husband… he took care of all that paperwork. I don't think so. The doctor did say something about my blood pressure once, but that was years ago. I don’t recall ever being told I had anything… serious. I've always just been… generally healthy, I suppose. A few aches and pains, but nothing a good night’s sleep wouldn't fix. Until recently, anyway. It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical diagnoses other than potentially high blood pressure in the past. That's good to know. And it sounds like this joint issue is relatively new. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I think. And… oh! I had a cataract in one eye a few years back. That's it, I believe. Nothing major. Nothing to do with my joints, certainly. It’s all a bit… blurry, remembering everything. I try not to dwell on the past.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and cataract surgery a few years ago. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have arthritis, lupus, or other autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother had… something in her hands, I think. A doctor said it was arthritis. She complained about it a lot. And my sister… she had something with her stomach, but I don't remember the name. It wasn't her joints, though. I had a son, but… he lived far away. I haven’t seen him in years. He always said I worried too much. It's all a bit… sad, thinking about it. But no, I don’t recall anyone else with joint problems specifically.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had arthritis, and your sister had a stomach condition. That’s helpful information. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to, but I always made him go outside. It smelled terrible. No, no smoking. I like fresh air, gardening, you know? It's a good life, mostly. Just these joints… getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. That's good. Now, before we move on to an examination, can you tell me what medications you are currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky one. Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, I think. A small white one. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleep aids. The kind with… diphenhydramine, I think it’s called? And that’s it, I believe. Nothing else regularly. Just those two things, when needed. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. It makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure and an over-the-counter sleep aid with diphenhydramine as needed. Alright, Lilliana, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. That gives me a really good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll be checking your joints, listening to your heart and lungs, and just getting a general sense of how you’re doing. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded too much, if you don’t mind. But I understand you need to do what you need to do. Go ahead, I’ll try to be still. It’s just… my joints are a little sensitive today, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go. Okay, let’s start with your hands. Can you open and close your fists for me a few times?
PATIENT: There we go… ooh, that’s a little stiff. It’s harder than it used to be. See? Not very smooth, is it? And it feels… achy when I do that. Just a little bit. It's worse in the mornings, though, usually. Not so bad now, I suppose. But it's definitely not as easy as it once was. Oh, and my knuckles… they feel a little bumpy, I think. But maybe that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some mild tenderness when I press on your knuckles, and I notice some slight swelling around a few of them. Your range of motion is a little limited, especially when making a full fist. And yes, I do feel some bony bumps around the knuckles, which are common with osteoarthritis. Now, let's move on to your knees. Can you bend them for me as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There we go… ooh, that’s a little uncomfortable. I can’t bend them as far as I used to. It feels… tight, you know? And a little creaky. Listen… Hear that? Creaky. It’s like they need oiling or something. It's worse in the mornings, of course. And getting up from a chair… well, that’s a project. But I can do it, I suppose. Just slowly. It doesn't hurt terribly, it’s just… uncomfortable. And a little achy sometimes. Do you see what I mean? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see what you mean. I feel some mild tenderness along the joint line of both knees, and I can hear a little bit of creaking when you bend them. There’s no significant swelling or warmth at this time. Your range of motion is limited, especially with bending. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Everything sounds clear. Okay, Lilliana. That's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing osteoarthritis in your hands and knees.
PATIENT: Osteo… what was that now? Arthritis, you said? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Will I be stuck in a chair forever? I just want to be able to garden again, you see. It's my favorite thing. And I don't want to be a burden on anyone. What does it mean? Is there anything I can do about it? I’m getting a little worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Lilliana. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear a diagnosis like that. “Osteoarthritis” simply means that the cartilage – the cushioning in your joints – has started to wear down over time. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll be stuck in a chair forever. It can cause pain and stiffness, like you’ve been experiencing, but there are many things we can do to manage it and help you stay active. It’s not something that progresses rapidly for everyone. The good news is, it sounds like it's relatively mild at this point. We can start with some conservative treatments, like: Gentle exercise: Strengthening the muscles around your joints can provide more support and reduce pain. Weight management: If you're carrying extra weight, losing even a small amount can take pressure off your knees. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Medications like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with pain and inflammation. Heat or cold packs: Applying heat or cold can also help relieve symptoms. We can also discuss physical therapy, which can teach you specific exercises to improve your strength and flexibility. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds better than being stuck in a chair. Exercise… I can probably manage that. Not much gardening lately, but I used to be quite active. Weight management… well, I do enjoy my baking, but I suppose I could cut back a little. And the over-the-counter stuff… I have some ibuprofen in the cupboard, I think. Physical therapy… that sounds a little scary, but if it helps… I suppose I could try it. So, no pills right away? That’s good. I really don’t like taking a lot of medication. And is it… is it something that gets worse and worse? Or can it stay like this? Will I still be able to garden? Those roses need pruning, you see… and I don’t want to let them go to seed.
DOCTOR: No, no pills right away. We'll start with those conservative measures and see how you respond. And you're right to ask about it getting worse. The progression of osteoarthritis varies a lot from person to person. For some people, it remains relatively stable for many years. For others, it can gradually worsen over time. That's why it’s important to stay active and manage your symptoms. As for gardening… I think you can absolutely still garden! You may need to modify how you do things – take more breaks, use tools with longer handles to reduce bending, and listen to your body. It's important to avoid putting too much stress on your joints. I'm happy to provide you with a referral to a physical therapist, and I can also give you some information on exercises you can do at home. Would you like me to write down those exercises for you now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please! That would be wonderful. And a referral to the physical therapist… yes, please. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And if it gets too bad… what then? Are there other things you can do? I just… I don't want to lose my independence, you see. It's important to me. I want to be able to look after myself. And those roses… they depend on me! They're my pride and joy. I’ve had them for years. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little. It’s nice to talk to someone who understands.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I understand your concerns completely, and I’m here to help you maintain your independence and enjoy your life. If those conservative measures aren't enough, there are other options we can consider. We can discuss injections to help lubricate the joints and reduce pain, or, in more severe cases, surgery to replace the joint. But those are options we’ll explore only if necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting you started with these exercises and the physical therapy referral. I’ll also write down a note about modifying your gardening activities. Here you go. These exercises are gentle, so start slowly and listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop and rest. I’ll also give you a handout with more information about osteoarthritis and tips for managing your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, this is very helpful. Thank you. And the handout… yes, that would be wonderful. No… I think that’s all for now. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I just… I need to remember to take it slow. And listen to my body. And not overdo it in the garden. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. You're a kind and patient doctor. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. Remember, I'm here for you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, enjoy your gardening – just take it easy! Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
