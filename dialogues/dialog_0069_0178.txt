DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just...Gerardo is fine. I got this cough, see? Been hacking it up for...well, a while now. And I'm just tired all the time. Gets real bad with these sinus things, too. Feels like my head's gonna split open sometimes. Honestly, I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerardo, I understand. A cough, fatigue, and sinus pressure – that sounds quite uncomfortable. “A while now” is a little vague, though. Could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, I reckon it started… maybe back in February? Around then, anyway. It comes and goes, but it's been constant since… April, I guess. Like, it’ll quiet down for a day or two, then BAM, it’s back worse than before. Does that make any sense? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, thank you. So, it started around February, quieted down for a bit, but has been consistently bothering you since April. And you mentioned fatigue along with the cough and sinus pressure. Is the cough producing anything – like mucus?
PATIENT: Yeah, it does. It’s… it’s usually got stuff in it. Mucus, I guess you’d call it. Sometimes it’s clear, sometimes it’s… yellow-ish. And in the mornings, it’s always worse. Real thick and nasty. I usually gotta spit it up, if you wanna know. Sorry, that’s probably too much information.
DOCTOR: No, it’s important information, Gerardo, please don’t apologize. Yellow mucus can be telling. And it's good you mentioned it's worse in the mornings. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the cough, or make it worse – like certain smells, cold air, or lying down?
PATIENT: Well, cold air definitely gets it going. When I go outside in the mornings, even if it ain't that cold, it'll start right up. And yeah, lying down sometimes makes it worse. I usually gotta prop myself up with a couple pillows to sleep okay. Smells... not really. Unless it's something real strong, like cleaning stuff, but that just makes me cough like anyone else. It just seems to come on its own a lot of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the cough, fatigue, and sinus pressure, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… I guess… sometimes I get a little bit of a fever. Not real high, just kinda warm. And my muscles ache sometimes, like I got the flu. But it doesn't happen every time I cough. Mostly just the tiredness and the… the gunk. Oh, and my head hurts a lot. Not just from the sinus stuff, but a dull ache in the back of my neck too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a low-grade fever, muscle aches occasionally, and a dull ache in the back of your neck along with the cough, fatigue, sinus pressure, and mucus. Have you had any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: I haven't really been eating much, to be honest. Not 'cause I don't want to, just… don't feel like it. Everything tastes kinda bland. And I reckon I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven't weighed myself. My clothes feel a bit looser, that’s all. Not a big deal, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any shortness of breath or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I haven’t been short of breath, no. It’s just… a cough. A really annoying, tiring cough. It feels like it’s deep down in my chest, but it don’t hurt. Just… makes me exhausted. I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerardo. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Nah. Nothin’ like that. I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor got it under control with some pills a long time ago. I haven't taken 'em in years though. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains for an old guy. No fancy diseases or nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix out when I was a kid. Real simple, back in… well, a long time ago. That’s it. Nothin’ else. They used to just send you home a few days later back then, no big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: Huh. My mom, she had… I think it was arthritis. Real bad in her hands. And my dad, he smoked his whole life, ended up with somethin' wrong with his lungs. That’s about all I know, really. My family don't really talk about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nah. Never touched the stuff. My dad smoked enough for all of us. I always figured it was a bad idea. And my wife… well, she didn’t approve, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I'll have a beer now and then, with supper. Nothing crazy. Just one or two, maybe on a Friday or Saturday. Don't really care for it much, to be honest. It just... goes with the food sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah. Not that I know of. I’ve taken some pills over the years, for headaches and stuff, and never had a problem. And I eat pretty much anything. I think I might be a little sensitive to bee stings, but that was when I was a kid. Didn't get real bad, just a little swollen.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’. Just… the occasional aspirin for a headache. That’s it. I mostly just try to rest when I feel bad. Don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerardo. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you gotta do, Doc. Just gettin’ this cough sorted is all I care about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale… good. Another one… in and out. This might be a little uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything is particularly painful. Your temperature is 99.2°F, which is slightly elevated. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little higher than ideal, but not terribly concerning given your history. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but I did notice some mild wheezing in your lungs and some tenderness in your sinuses. It sounds like you might have some inflammation in your airways and sinuses. I'm going to order some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doc. Tests are fine. I just wanna know what's makin' me feel so rotten. What kinda tests are we talkin' about? I ain't real fond of needles, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about needles, Gerardo. We'll try to minimize discomfort as much as possible. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. That doesn't involve a needle. And I'd like to do a complete blood count – CBC – to check for signs of infection, and a basic metabolic panel – BMP – to assess your kidney function and electrolyte balance. The CBC and BMP will require a small blood sample, drawn from your arm. It’s a quick procedure. We’ll also do a flu and COVID test, just to rule those out. That's a nasal swab. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. A swab’s alright, I guess. And the blood… well, I don't like it, but if you say it's necessary... What’s the point of the kidney stuff? Don't see what my kidneys got to do with a cough. And how long will I have to wait for the results? I don’t wanna be comin' back here a dozen times.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Gerardo. The kidney test – the BMP – helps us understand your overall health and make sure your body is processing medications properly. Sometimes, infections or inflammation can affect kidney function, and it's good to have a baseline to compare against. It also rules out other causes of your fatigue. As for the results, the flu and COVID tests should be back within about 15 minutes. The CBC and BMP usually take a couple of hours to process. We can review them together this afternoon, and I can call you if anything urgent comes up. It shouldn't require a separate visit. In the meantime, to help relieve your symptoms, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the fever and aches, and a decongestant for the sinus pressure. And plenty of fluids. Do you have any allergies to either of those medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies to those. I’ve taken ‘em both before, when I got a cold. Fluids… yeah, I can manage that. So, I just gotta sit here for a couple hours while you run the tests, and then we talk about it? Sounds alright. And then… what? Will I need pills? Or somethin’ stronger? I’m just lookin’ to feel normal again, Doc. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll sit here for a couple of hours while the lab processes the tests, and then we’ll review the results together. Whether you need pills or something stronger will depend entirely on the results. If it's a simple viral infection, rest and over-the-counter medication might be enough. If it’s something more serious, we may need to consider antibiotics or other treatments. I won’t prescribe anything until we have a better understanding of what’s going on. Let me go ahead and get the lab orders started, and a nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the swab for the flu and COVID tests. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that’s it. Just… hurry up, okay? I ain’t gettin’ any younger. Thank you, Doc.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gerardo. I understand. I’ll get the orders sent right away. The nurse will be with you shortly. I’ll be back to review the results with you this afternoon.
PATIENT: .
