DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It's been botherin' me a bit, and I know I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctor told me it was… atrial fib-ri-lay-shun? Something like that. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Swelling in your left leg and you’ve been told you have atrial fibrillation. That is something we need to look into. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a bit bigger than usual at the end of the day. But it's gotten worse these last couple of days. I was hopin' it would go down on its own, but it hasn't. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Swelling that worsens over a few days definitely warrants a look. Is the swelling accompanied by any pain, redness, or warmth in your leg?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, no. It feels… heavy, mostly. And a bit tight. No redness that I've noticed, and it doesn't feel warmer than my other leg. It just… is there. A big, swollen leg. Sorry, I'm not very good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you're doing fine. "Heavy" and "tight" are helpful descriptions. And no redness or warmth is good. Now, let’s talk about this atrial fibrillation you mentioned. Has the heartbeat felt different recently?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. It’s… harder to say exactly. It feels like it’s… flutterin' more, maybe? And faster. It doesn’t happen all the time, just comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes sense. It usually stops after a bit, but it's been happenin' more often these last few weeks, same as the leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both the leg swelling and the irregular heartbeat seem to be increasing in frequency. That’s important information. Do you notice anything specifically that triggers the irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I thought maybe if I drank too much coffee it would make it worse, but I don't think so. Or if I was stressed, but I'm always a bit stressed, to be honest. It just… happens. Sometimes when I'm walkin', sometimes when I'm sittin'… there doesn't seem to be a pattern, Doctor. It's very random. I wish I knew what was causin' it!
DOCTOR: I understand. Random occurrences are difficult to pinpoint. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to check your leg. We'll start with your heart. Can you lie back on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's alright, I suppose. I don't usually mind the listenin' part. Just a bit nervous about the leg, to be honest. Is it somethin' serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I do hear some irregularity, consistent with atrial fibrillation. I’m also hearing some normal heart sounds, but the irregularity is definitely present. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. Can you point to where the swelling is the worst?
PATIENT: Yes, right here. It's mostly here, and it goes up a bit higher on the side of my leg. It's hard to explain, but it feels… puffy. And when I press it… …it doesn't bounce back as quick as it should, does it? I read somethin' about that on the internet. Is that… bad? I shouldn't really look things up, I know.
DOCTOR: You're right, there is some pitting edema present. It doesn't spring back immediately. And you are right to be concerned, it's good you're paying attention. We need to figure out what's causing this swelling. Given the combination of the atrial fibrillation and the swelling in your leg, I want to order a few tests. We’ll start with a D-dimer blood test to rule out a blood clot, and an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. We’ll also check your kidney function with a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A blood test and a heart thing. I suppose that's what doctors do. A D-di-mer… is that a serious test? And the EKG… will that be uncomfortable? I don't like needles, if you haven't guessed. But if it's important… I'll do it. I just… get worried easily, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be worried, and I appreciate you telling me about your anxiety regarding needles. The D-dimer is a blood test to look for evidence of a blood clot. It’s not painful, just a quick prick. The EKG is also non-invasive. We’ll place some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt at all. It just takes a few minutes. We'll get the results back relatively quickly. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you elevate your leg whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, elevatin' it and not standin' too long… I can do that. I sit at a desk most of the day for work, so that shouldn't be too difficult. The sticky pads sound alright too. It's just the needle… I always get a bit lightheaded. But I'll try, Doctor. Thank you for explainin' everything so… calmly. It helps. Will I need to come back to discuss the results, or will you phone me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand your anxiety, and we can take things slowly with the blood draw. We'll have the nurse draw the blood, and she's very good at making people comfortable. I'll review the results as soon as they're available, and I will phone you with the findings. If anything concerning shows up, I may ask you to come back in for further evaluation. It’s important to rule out a deep vein thrombosis given the swelling and your history of atrial fibrillation. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: A deep… what was it? A deep vein… thing? Is that serious? And the atrial fib-ri-lay-shun… is that somethin' I'll have to live with forever? I just… I worry about all these things. And I don't want to end up in the hospital. I don't do well with hospitals. Sorry, I'm askin' a lot, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too much at all, Nixon. It's good you're asking questions. A deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the leg. It can be serious because the clot can travel to your lungs, which is what we want to rule out with the D-dimer test. As for the atrial fibrillation, it's a chronic condition, meaning it can be long-lasting. However, it's often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. Whether you'll need long-term treatment depends on the cause and severity of your condition. We’ll know more once we have the test results. And I completely understand your anxiety about hospitals. We'll do everything we can to avoid that, and the goal right now is to get a clear diagnosis and start appropriate management. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we'll take it from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. The nurse and the blood, then we'll see. Thank you, Doctor Piet. You've been very kind. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, and not… laughin' at all my worryin'. I suppose I'm ready for the needle. As much as I can be, anyway. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. And please don’t worry, I’m not laughing at all. It’s my job to listen and address your concerns. The nurse will be in shortly. Just take a deep breath, and we'll get through it. I'll let her know you're ready. .
