DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good...good mornin’ to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got a whole lotta time, so let’s just get right to it. I need somethin’ signed. A paper. For… for fixin’ myself up a little. It’s about… well, it's somethin’ cosmetic. That’s all you need to know. I just need your say-so, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a form signed for a cosmetic procedure. While I'm happy to review it, as your physician, I do need to understand what procedure it is for, and why you're seeking it, even briefly. It’s important for me to make sure it’s safe for you and that you understand what you’re consenting to. It doesn’t have to be a long story, just a general idea will do. Do you have the form with you?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I don't see why that matters. It's my body. I just want a little touch-up, alright? A little… improve-ment. I ain’t lookin’ for a whole makeover. And honestly, I don’t rightly remember why I decided on it. Old age, I guess. It's somethin' to do with… my face. Here. Just sign it, please. I got appointments.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're short on time and want to proceed quickly, but I do need to ask a few basic questions before I can sign off on this. It’s not about questioning your decision, it’s about ensuring your safety. First, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, latex, or skin products?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I been livin’ a long time, Doctor. If I was allergic to somethin’, I’d know it by now. Mostly, I just stay away from fancy things. Give me somethin’ simple, somethin’ reliable. I don’t recall ever havin’ a bad reaction to anything. Now, are you gonna sign this or what? My time is valuable, you know. I got towers to climb.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any previous cosmetic procedures done?
PATIENT: Cosmetic procedures… hmm. Let me think… Nope. Not that I recall. Maybe somethin’ when I was younger, a long, long time ago. But nothin' serious. Definitely nothin' like this. Just… small things. I wouldn't remember it if it wasn't important. Mostly, I rely on hard work and a good shave. Now, can we get this over with? I'm startin' to lose daylight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your desire to move quickly, but I need to explain that dermal fillers, while generally safe, do carry some risks. There's a small chance of infection, bruising, swelling, and, very rarely, more serious complications. I also want to ask about your medical history. Do you have any conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Now you're makin' me nervous, Doctor! Infections? Bruisin’? I ain’t made of glass! Look, I been climbin' radio towers for forty years. I’ve had worse scrapes and bruises than any little needle prick could cause. And as for them… them illnesses you mentioned... No, none of that. Strong as an ox, I am! Auto… auto-what-now? I just want to look a little… presentable. This is gettin' ridiculous. I need a signature, not a lecture. You’re a doctor, sign the paper.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, have you ever had any skin infections around your mouth or face?
PATIENT: Skin infections? Look, I keep myself clean! I shower every day! What kind of question is that? I told you, I'm strong as an ox! No infections. None. Now, are you gonna sign this or do I need to find another doctor? I haven't got all day, and frankly, you're starting to waste my time. Just sign the blasted paper. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I have a responsibility to ensure this procedure is safe for you. Given your limited medical history and the fact that you're unsure about past conditions, I'm not comfortable signing this form at this time. It’s not about questioning your strength, it's about minimizing potential risks. I would strongly recommend a consultation with a dermatologist before proceeding with dermal fillers. They can perform a thorough examination and determine if you are a suitable candidate. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Are you serious?! After all this, you're not signing it? You’re tellin’ me, after I sat here answerin’ your questions – most of which didn’t even make sense – you’re sendin’ me to another doctor? This is a complete waste of my time. Look, I don't need a referral. I don’t need your opinions. I'll find someone else. Someone who understands that a man has things to do! Don't bother callin'. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I am prioritizing your health and safety. I wish you all the best. .
