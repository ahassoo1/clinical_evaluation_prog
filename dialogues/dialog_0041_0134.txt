DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, good to meet you. I’m Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Polczynski. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been feeling awfully sick to my tummy lately. And I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's been going on for a little while now, but it feels worse recently. I… I don't really remember exactly when it started, if that makes sense. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Raymonde. It's perfectly alright if dates aren’t crystal clear. We’ll figure it out. “Sick to your tummy” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not exactly…vomiting, not usually. More like a queasy feeling, you know? Like when you're on a boat, but I haven’t been on a boat in years! It just… sits there. And then, like I said, I get full so quickly. A few bites of food and I feel like I’ve eaten a whole feast. It’s making it hard to keep my strength up, especially with…well, with everything. I used to love a good meal, but now…not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasy and getting full quickly… that gives me a little more to work with. And you mentioned it’s affecting your strength. Have you noticed any other changes, like unintended weight loss, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear… weight loss… hmm. I haven’t really been weighing myself, to be honest. My daughter usually keeps track of things like that, but she's been so busy lately. I suppose I feel a little thinner, but I just thought that was… old age, you know? As for…well, the other thing… it’s been a bit irregular, yes. Not normal. I don't really like talking about things like that, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Raymonde. It’s perfectly alright if you're uncomfortable talking about specifics. “Irregular” is enough for now. Let's just say it’s changed from what’s usual for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Changed. Not… the same. And… sometimes there's just… nothing. Other times... well, I don't want to get into details. It's just… it’s all a bit unsettling. I don’t feel like myself, and I’m worried something serious is going on. I've had a bit of… a history with things like this, you see. My husband… he…
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear that, Raymonde. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. It's understandable that you’re worried. We'll take things slowly and try to figure out what's going on. You mentioned a history… could you tell me a little bit about that, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… my husband, bless his heart, he… he had the cancer. A long time ago, now. It was in his… stomach, I think. And… well, I was his caregiver. I saw everything. It was… hard. That’s why I’m so worried now, you see. I recognize some of the feelings… the nausea, the loss of appetite… It just brings back a lot of bad memories. I suppose I’m being silly, jumping to conclusions. But it’s hard not to, after everything. I don't remember all the details of his illness, though. It's all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Raymonde. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious given your history, and it’s good that you’re sharing this with me. It helps me understand what’s going on. And it’s alright that the details are fuzzy; trauma can do that to your memory. Let’s try to focus on you right now. Besides the nausea, fullness and changes in your bowel habits, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling awfully tired lately, more so than usual. And a little weak, like my legs might give out. Nothing major, just… easily worn out. Oh, and sometimes I get a little… breathless. Not when I’m doing anything, just… resting. I’ve also been having a bit of trouble sleeping. I wake up a lot during the night, for no particular reason. And… My appetite isn’t the only thing that’s changed. Things just don’t taste the same anymore. Everything seems… bland.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, weakness, breathlessness, trouble sleeping, and a change in your taste… that’s a lot to take into account. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss, any pain in your abdomen, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear… weight loss… hmm. I haven’t really been weighing myself, to be honest. My daughter usually keeps track of things like that, but she's been so busy lately. I suppose I feel a little thinner, but I just thought that was… old age, you know? As for pain… not really. Maybe a little discomfort sometimes, but nothing sharp or severe. It comes and goes. And… I’m afraid I have noticed a little… blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It’s been happening… off and on. That’s why I came, really. It frightened me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Raymonde, thank you for sharing that with me. It's important information. The blood, even if it’s not a lot, definitely warrants further investigation. And the weight loss, even if you haven't been weighing yourself, combined with the other symptoms we’ve discussed, is concerning. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. It's probably nothing, but it's better to be safe than sorry, isn't it? You're very kind to take such good care of me. My daughter… she worries, you know. She's a good girl, but she's always so busy. I don't like to bother her with these things unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. Let's just start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me when I ask. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. I'll start here on the right side. Hmm. A little tenderness here in the lower left quadrant, but nothing too significant. No masses or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft overall. Okay, Raymonde. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I think it’s important to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia and infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool test to check for blood and infection. We may also need to consider a colonoscopy, depending on the results of these initial tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh my… a colonoscopy… that sounds… unpleasant. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I trust your judgement. I just… I don't like the thought of it. But I want to know what's going on, you know? I just want to feel better. The tests… are they expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what it covers. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I don’t want to worry my daughter unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Raymonde. A colonoscopy isn’t the most pleasant procedure, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your colon. We'll make sure you're comfortable and well-prepared if we decide to go that route. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers colonoscopies for individuals over a certain age, especially if there’s a medical reason like blood in your stool. Our billing department will verify your coverage and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. As for the results, the initial blood tests should be back within a few days. The stool test usually takes a little longer, about a week or so. If we do proceed with a colonoscopy, it will take a few days to schedule the appointment and then another week or so to get the results back. We’ll keep you informed every step of the way and discuss the findings as soon as we have them. For now, let's focus on getting those initial tests done. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and give you instructions for the stool test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I just… I’ve had a lot of bad experiences with doctors in the past, and I get anxious easily. It’s good to know you’re taking my concerns seriously. And… thank you for being so patient. Please, just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare for the tests. I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could ease some of your anxiety. We’ll take things at your pace, and you can always ask questions if you’re unsure about anything. The nurse will explain everything you need to do to prepare for the blood tests and the stool test. It's generally pretty straightforward. Just follow her instructions, and don't hesitate to call our office if you have any questions. I’m going to make a note of everything we’ve discussed today in your chart, and then I’ll let the nurse know to come in and get started.
