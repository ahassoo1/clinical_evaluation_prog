DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's… well, it's my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and nothing’s working. It’s been going on for weeks, and frankly, it’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weeks of diarrhea can certainly be disruptive and uncomfortable. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. When you say “everything,” could you be a little more specific about what you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Do I have to list every single thing? Fine. Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, those charcoal tablets… you know, the usual stuff. And I even tried some herbal tea a friend recommended, but that just made it worse. It’s not like I haven't tried things. I just want something that works.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, those are all common remedies. And it sounds like you’ve been quite proactive trying to manage it on your own. I apologize for asking, I sometimes find knowing what hasn’t worked is just as helpful as knowing what has. Could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I supposed to say? It's… watery. It’s brown, obviously. Look, I’m not a doctor, and I don’t need a detailed questionnaire about my… waste. It’s frequent, okay? Really frequent. And it smells…bad. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Frequent, watery, and foul-smelling stools. We need to figure out why this is happening. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Look, I told you, I’m not going to start examining my… everything. I know when something’s seriously wrong, and I would've said something if there was blood. Mucus… maybe? I don’t know. It’s just… stuff. Honestly, I don't spend my time analyzing it. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s alright, you don’t need to go into excessive detail. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm tired, obviously. Running to the bathroom constantly is exhausting. And my stomach cramps, a lot. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Just… generally miserable. Is that good enough? I’m starting to feel like you're just trying to waste my time.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I'm trying to gather information to help you, and you're giving me a good picture of what's happening. Fatigue, cramps, and nausea are all relevant. Now, thinking back, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. It just… started. I haven’t changed my diet or anything. I eat pretty normally. Maybe it's something going around? A bug, or something? I don't know. I really don't spend a lot of time thinking about what I eat. And I certainly don’t keep a diary of my bowel movements. This is all so… invasive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. We're just trying to rule things out. Alright. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No fever. No chills. And no, I don’t have body aches. I just feel weak, probably from… well, you know. Everything. I really need to get this sorted out. I have things to do, and I can’t keep running to the bathroom all day. Look, can we just get me something to stop it? I don’t need a long explanation, just a solution.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I really don’t have time for this. But don’t expect me to tell you everything I ate for the last week or anything. I'm not a food blogger.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch in the lower quadrants, but no significant guarding or rigidity. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Your temperature is normal, as you said. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Where would I even go? I haven’t left the state in years. I stay pretty close to home. This is just… ridiculous. Are you suspecting I picked something up on a cruise ship? Honestly. I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: No, I wasn't suspecting anything specific. Just trying to rule things out. Okay. Do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Look, I was widowed three years ago. My husband… he took care of all that. I don't know about "underlying conditions". I haven’t really had a doctor since then. I'm generally healthy. I paint houses, for goodness sake. That’s physical work. I wouldn't be able to do that if I was sickly. It's just this… this stomach thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Some ibuprofen for aches and pains when I'm working. And occasionally something for a headache. I don't take anything regularly. Honestly, I avoid medication as much as possible. I don't trust those things. This is getting really annoying. Can we just get to a solution? I need something to stop this diarrhea. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the lack of fever, blood in the stool, or recent travel, it’s possible this is a viral gastroenteritis – a stomach bug – or perhaps some food intolerance causing irritation. However, given the duration of your symptoms – weeks – and the fact that over-the-counter remedies aren't helping, we need to investigate further. I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out any bacterial infections or parasites. Also, a complete blood count to check for inflammation. And perhaps a basic metabolic panel to assess your electrolyte balance, as prolonged diarrhea can lead to dehydration. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Seriously? Look, I don’t do tests. I just want something to stop it. Can’t you just give me something? Like, I don’t know, something stronger than Pepto-Bismol? I have work to do. And I really don't want to spend my day running back and forth to a lab. This is… inconvenient. Fine. Whatever. Just… make it quick. But if it takes too long, I’m walking out. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your frustration. We can start with a prescription for loperamide – that’s the active ingredient in Imodium, but a stronger dose, and perhaps a probiotic to help restore your gut flora. However, it’s important to remember that this is just symptomatic relief. If your symptoms don’t improve within 48 hours, or if they worsen, we need to do those tests. And if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll have the nurse draw the lab requisition for you now. And I’ll write the prescription. Does that sound acceptable?
