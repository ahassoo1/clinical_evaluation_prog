DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Vantine, is it?
PATIENT: Indeed. Jarvis Vantine, at your service. Though I confess, “service” feels a bit strong these days. More like… seeking advice, perhaps? A pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? I believe I read your name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And please, just Doctor Dechêne will do. Now, let's not waste time with pleasantries. You're 85, I see. What brings you in today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor Dechêne. Efficiency is always admirable. Well, to put it bluntly, I’ve been… experimenting. With diets. Rather foolishly, in retrospect. A friend – a younger fellow, mind you, full of enthusiasm – convinced me this “Paleo” thing would restore my youthful vigour. It hasn’t, and I fear it may have… subtracted some. I’m hoping you can tell me if I’ve done any lasting damage, and perhaps dissuade me from further… adventures.
DOCTOR: “Paleo,” of course. Another fad. And what specifically has been… subtracted, as you put it?
PATIENT: Well, primarily energy, Doctor. A good deal of it. I used to be able to potter about in the garden all day, quite happily. Now, I find myself… needing rather frequent rests. And my digestion… well, let’s just say it’s become… unpredictable. It started quite subtly, a bit of bloating, then… other things. Not alarming, precisely, but certainly inconvenient. And my wife – my ex-wife, I should clarify – always said I looked a bit peaky after a week on it. She had a very discerning eye, you know. Though perhaps a bit too critical at times.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable how?
PATIENT: Oh, a variety of ways, Doctor. Sometimes… too little activity, if you understand. Other times, rather too much. And the discomfort, naturally. Not constant, thankfully. It's more… sporadic. Accompanied by a good deal of rumbling, and the occasional… urge. It’s rather disrupting my routine, which, at my age, is rather important. I like to have my tea at precisely three o’clock, you see, and these… incidents… make timing rather difficult. I do apologize for being so… detailed. I always was one for specifics.
DOCTOR: Right. So, altered bowel habits, fatigue… anything else?
PATIENT: Indeed. My sleep has been… fragmented. I used to sleep soundly, through and through. Now, I find myself waking several times a night. Not because of discomfort, necessarily, though occasionally that’s the cause. More… a general restlessness. And I’ve noticed a slight… tingling in my hands and feet, particularly in the evenings. It's not painful, just… noticeable. And my appetite has diminished somewhat, though that could be simply a consequence of everything else, of course. I'm trying to maintain a reasonable intake, but it’s proving… challenging. I'm not losing weight dramatically, though. Not yet, at least.
DOCTOR: Any known allergies?
PATIENT: None that I’m aware of, Doctor. I've eaten rather a broad range of things throughout my life, and never had any… adverse reactions. Though, now you mention it, the Paleo diet did involve a considerable amount of nuts. Perhaps that’s relevant? I believe some people have… sensitivities. I don't recall ever experiencing any problems with nuts specifically, but it’s possible. I used to enjoy a rather robust walnut cake, you see, and never suffered any ill effects. But then, I wasn’t consuming quite so many walnuts at a time.
DOCTOR: And current medications?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. A small dose of Lisinopril, for blood pressure. Been taking it for… oh, must be fifteen years now. Doctor Albright prescribed it, years ago. It seems to do the trick, perfectly well. No side effects to speak of. Occasionally a slight dryness in the mouth, but nothing a glass of water can’t resolve. I’m rather diligent about taking it, precisely at eight o’clock every morning. Routine is, as I may have mentioned, rather important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Lead the way. Though, if you don’t mind, I’d prefer to keep my jacket on. It gets a bit… drafty in here. I confess, my circulation isn’t what it once was. And please, do let me know if you require any… assistance. I can be surprisingly nimble for my age, but I wouldn’t want to cause any… complications.
DOCTOR: As you wish. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly diminished intensity. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, although breath sounds are somewhat decreased at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly hypoactive. No obvious masses or organomegaly.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t unpleasant at all, Doctor. A bit chilly, perhaps, but perfectly tolerable. And no alarming prodding, which is always reassuring. Is everything as it should be, or have you detected something untoward? I confess, I’m rather anxious to determine the extent of the damage, so to speak. And if it’s… severe, is there anything I should be doing immediately? Perhaps abstaining from walnuts altogether? I do enjoy a good walnut, you see… but I’m willing to make sacrifices.
DOCTOR: The physical exam is… inconclusive. Your heart sounds are a bit faint, but that’s not uncommon at your age. The hypoactive bowel sounds and tenderness could be related to the diet, or a number of other things. We’ll need some blood work to rule out any deficiencies, and I'm going to order a stool sample to check for inflammation or infection. And yes, I would recommend eliminating nuts from your diet immediately. It's unlikely to be the sole cause of your symptoms, but it’s a sensible precaution.
PATIENT: Very sensible indeed, Doctor. Eliminating the nuts. Consider it done. Though it pains me to say it, I shall abstain. And the blood work and… stool sample, of course. As unpleasant as that sounds, I’m willing to cooperate fully. When can I expect the results? And would you recommend any… temporary dietary adjustments while we await them? Something bland, perhaps? I recall my mother always recommending broth when one was feeling unwell. Is that still considered… sound advice? And should I be concerned about resuming any form of exercise? I enjoy a gentle stroll in the garden, you see… but I wouldn’t want to exacerbate the situation.
DOCTOR: The lab results will take approximately three to five business days. In the meantime, a bland diet is… acceptable. Avoid anything spicy, fatty, or highly processed. And no strenuous activity. Gentle walking is fine, but don't overexert yourself. I'm also going to order a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Here are the lab requisitions. The nurse will explain the procedure for the stool sample. And please, try to relax. It's likely just a temporary digestive upset related to the diet. We'll discuss the results when they come back. Don’t call unless it’s an emergency.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. A comprehensive approach, as one would expect. I shall endeavor to relax, though I confess, my mind tends to wander. I’ll follow your instructions to the letter: bland diet, gentle walking, and no strenuous activity. And I shall await the results with… patience, of sorts. Thank you for your time, and your… thoroughness. I appreciate your attention to detail. And if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall leave you to your… duties. Stop.
