DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, you see? Been botherin’ me for a little while now, nothin’ terrible, but… persistent, y’know? Like a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a persistent headache… alright. And how long exactly has this been going on, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, goodness. It started… sometime in June, I’d say. Maybe the first week of June? It comes and goes, not every day, but often enough to be a nuisance. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, you see, ‘cause some days it’s barely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting in June. And would you describe it as a constant ache, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: It’s definitely more comin’ and goin’, Doctor. Not a steady pain all the time. It’ll be there for a few hours, then fade away for a day or two, then come back. Like little waves, yeah, that’s a good way to put it. Not sharp, mind you, just… heavy. A heavy ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, a heavy, wave-like ache at the back of your head, starting in June. And has anything specific seemed to bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Now, let me see... nothin’ specific that I can put my finger on. I do notice it sometimes after I’ve been bendin’ over for a while, doin’ someone’s toes, you know, with the manicure work. But even then, not always. And sometimes it's there even if I haven't been doin’ much bendin’ at all. It's a bit of a mystery, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending can sometimes trigger it, but not always. And you mentioned manicure work… is that your profession, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it is. I’m a manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ it for… well, a long time now! It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it, but it can be hard on the back, I suppose. Though I always try to be careful with my posture. My wife, bless her heart, always reminds me!
DOCTOR: Alright, so prolonged bending and posture might be playing a role. Now, besides the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms – anything at all – like vision changes, dizziness, nausea, or any numbness or weakness?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or nausea, thank goodness. And my vision’s still as good as it ever was, I suppose – well, for an old man! No numbness or weakness either. Just the headache, really. Sometimes a bit of stiffness in my neck, but I put that down to the work, you know? Spendin' hours leanin' over folks' feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the headache and occasional neck stiffness. Have you tried anything to relieve the headache yourself, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I have. Mostly just rest, you know? Lie down for a bit, try to relax. Sometimes a warm compress on the back of my neck helps a little. And my wife gives me these herbal teas, says they're good for headaches. She’s a good woman, that one. They don’t always cure it, but they take the edge off, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, rest, warm compresses, and herbal teas. And have you ever had headaches like this before, or is this something new?
PATIENT: This is… new, Doctor. I’ve had headaches before, of course, everyone does! But never quite like this. Not this persistent, not this achey at the back of the head. Usually, if I get a headache, it’s more of a throbbing one, and a little bit of aspirin sorts it right out. But this… this doesn't respond to aspirin, not really. It just sort of… lingers.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is a new type of headache, doesn't respond to aspirin. Let me just check your blood pressure and pulse. And then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. Always good to be thorough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your range of motion in your neck and shoulders. Can you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go. Feels alright, I think. My wife always says I breathe too shallow, but… well, she worries. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, could you gently turn your head to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Like this? No pain there, but… feels a little stiff, you know? Not sharp, just… restricted. A little creaky, like an old door. I suppose that's to be expected at my age.
DOCTOR: There’s some tightness in your neck muscles, especially on the back side. And some tenderness when I press here. It seems like you do have some muscle tension. Now, one last thing, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm for me. Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Feels… normal, I suppose. Haven't thought much about my reflexes lately! Mostly just think about rememberin' where I put my spectacles.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing tension headaches, likely related to the repetitive bending and posture from your work as a manicurist and pedicurist. The muscle tightness in your neck is consistent with that. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor as well. Now, I’m going to recommend a few things. First, let’s try some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain. But since aspirin isn’t effective, we’ll avoid that. And I’d like you to focus on improving your posture, taking frequent breaks during work, and doing some gentle neck stretches. I can give you a handout with some examples. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a handout would be wonderful, thank you. That sounds sensible, what you say. I do tend to just… keep goin', you know? Forget to take breaks. And my posture… well, my wife tells me off about that all the time! So, gentle stretches and better breaks. I can try that. Is there anything else I should be lookin’ out for? Any sign that I should come back sooner?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. If the headache becomes severe, doesn’t respond to the pain relievers, or is accompanied by any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Also, it’s important to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. I can give you some information on how to do that. And, since you're uninsured, I can connect you with some local resources that offer free or low-cost health services. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be a great help, thank you. Free or low-cost services would be wonderful. My wife worries about the bills, you see. And yes, please, any information on monitoring my blood pressure at home would be appreciated. I’ll try to remember to take breaks and stretch more, and I’ll keep an eye out for those new symptoms. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor, thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse print out the handout with stretches and information on blood pressure monitoring. And I’ll get you the information on local resources. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You've been very thorough and kind. I appreciate your time and attention. Thank you again. I'll see you in four weeks then.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. You take care now. And remember to take those breaks! Have a good day.
