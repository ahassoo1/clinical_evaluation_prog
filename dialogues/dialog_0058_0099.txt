DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding some results from a… a test I had done on my insides. An endoscopy, I believe it was called. The doctor who performed it said something didn’t look quite right, and I was advised to come speak with someone about it. I must admit, I’m a little anxious, if you don’t mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that here. Endoscopy done… July 12th. Dr. Ramirez, good doctor. It’s understandable to be anxious when you're waiting on results like this. “Something didn’t look quite right” is… vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Indeed it is, Doctor. He was very busy that day, and I didn’t want to keep him from other patients, so I didn't press for specifics. He simply said I should follow up with someone, and my primary care physician sent me to you. Is there anything specific you saw that prompted concern? Perhaps a particular area, or… what exactly are we looking at here? I apologize for my directness, but I prefer to understand these things as clearly as possible.
DOCTOR: Well, the report does indicate a polyp was found in the ascending colon, approximately 1.5 cm in size. That’s what Dr. Ramirez flagged. Polyps are… fairly common, honestly. But they can sometimes be pre-cancerous, which is why follow-up is important. Now, before you get too worried, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. We just need to figure out what kind of polyp it is. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: A polyp, you say? I see. That is… concerning, naturally, but I appreciate your candor, Doctor. Thank you. Changes in my bowel habits… hmm. Let me think. I have noticed… well, I suppose I’ve been a bit more regular, if that makes sense. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… more frequent visits to the restroom. And sometimes… a little discomfort afterward, a sort of cramping. Nothing terribly painful, just… noticeable. It hasn't been severe enough to disrupt my routine, but it is different than usual. I haven’t noticed any blood, thankfully. Does that provide any useful information?
DOCTOR: More frequent visits and post-void cramping...okay. It could be related to the polyp, or it could be something else entirely. It’s good you haven’t noticed any blood, that's a positive. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Unintentional weight loss… let me see. That’s a good question. I suppose I have lost a few pounds in the last… oh, perhaps three months? But I’ve also been eating a little less, due to… well, my appetite hasn't been what it once was. It’s not a drastic change, Doctor. I wouldn’t say I’m wasting away, but the scale has been trending downwards. I attributed it to getting older, honestly. Less energy, less desire for large meals. But perhaps that’s not the whole story?
DOCTOR: "Less desire for large meals" at your age is… not unusual. Still, we need to rule things out. And weight loss, even if modest, is worth investigating alongside the polyp. Now, let's talk about your family history. Any history of colon cancer, polyps, or other gastrointestinal issues in your immediate family—parents, siblings?
PATIENT: That is fair, Doctor. I understand the need for thoroughness. As for family history… that's a bit difficult to recall with absolute certainty. My parents are… were both from a small village in Mexico, and record-keeping wasn’t always precise. My mother… she passed when I was quite young, and I don’t recall any specific illnesses she suffered. My father… he lived a long life, but I believe he had some stomach troubles toward the end. Vague complaints of discomfort, but nothing diagnosed, as far as I know. He was a very stoic man, didn't often speak of his ailments. My only sibling, a sister, lives in California. I haven’t seen her in many years, and we don’t discuss medical matters. I apologize for my lack of precise information. It’s not something I’ve ever actively kept track of.
DOCTOR: Right. Vague complaints aren’t particularly helpful. Look, most polyps are benign, okay?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It’s good to know that’s the most likely outcome. But even if benign, don't they still require removal? I recall hearing something about that. And… if removal is necessary, what does that entail? I’m a little concerned about the procedure itself, if you don’t mind my asking. I’ve never had anything like this done before. Is it painful? Will I be… incapacitated for a long time? I apologize for all the questions. I’m simply trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, they usually do remove them. It's called a colonoscopy with polypectomy. It's… relatively straightforward. A scope is inserted into the rectum to visualize and remove the polyp. You are sedated, so you won't feel anything during the procedure. Recovery is usually a day or two, maybe some mild cramping. Now, we need to determine the best course of action, but I am considering a full colonoscopy to evaluate the entire colon, not just where Dr. Ramirez found this one polyp. We can send a sample to pathology to determine its type. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. A full colonoscopy to get a better look, and send a sample for examination… it seems… sensible. I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. A scope and sedation… that does sound… manageable. Though, if I may ask another question… will this require any special preparation? I’ve heard stories about… well, let’s just say it doesn’t sound particularly pleasant. And will my insurance cover any of this? I unfortunately don’t have a policy at the moment, and I’m on a fixed income. I apologize for bringing up the financial aspect, but it’s a concern, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, it requires a thorough bowel prep. You’ll need to clear your system completely. It's… not pleasant, you’re right. As for insurance…you said you are uninsured?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. Unfortunately, I lost my coverage when I retired. It’s… a long story, involving bureaucratic difficulties and unexpected expenses. I've been putting it off for as long as possible, but this seems… unavoidable. Regarding the bowel preparation, could you please elaborate? What exactly does it entail? Are there any… alternatives? I understand it’s necessary, but I’m a little anxious about the process. I’ve always had a sensitive stomach, you see. And, if you wouldn’t mind giving me a rough estimate of the cost, that would be greatly appreciated. I need to assess my options and see what I can realistically afford. I truly apologize for all the questions, but I'm trying to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: Look, I'll be frank. It's going to be unpleasant. You’ll need to drink a large volume of a special solution – it’s a laxative – to completely empty your bowels. The prep instructions are on that form. As for cost, without insurance, a colonoscopy can run anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000. We have a payment plan option. Look, I can’t offer a discount, it’s just… the reality of healthcare. We also have some resources available to help identify financial assistance programs, if you'd like me to connect you with our social worker. Now, let’s focus on scheduling the procedure. Are you able to arrange transportation?
PATIENT: $1,500 to $3,000… that is… a considerable sum, Doctor. I anticipated some expense, naturally, but that is… daunting. A payment plan would be necessary, certainly. Thank you for mentioning that option. And connecting me with a social worker for financial assistance… that would be most appreciated. I will certainly take you up on that offer. Regarding transportation… that could be an issue. My neighbor, Mr. Henderson, is a kind man and occasionally drives me to appointments, but his schedule is… unpredictable. I suppose I could arrange a taxi, but that would add to the expense, naturally. Perhaps Mr. Henderson will be available. I will need to inquire. Before we schedule anything, though, could you perhaps clarify one more thing? This polyp… is it possible it’s not cancerous? I understand you said most aren’t, but is there a way to determine that before removing it? Some sort of scan, or… I apologize for my continued questioning. I simply want to be as informed as possible before proceeding.
DOCTOR: Look, the only way to know if it's cancerous is to remove it and send it to pathology. Scans can show something is there, but they can't tell you its nature. That’s why we do the procedure. We’re not going to be able to sit here and speculate. It’s likely benign. We remove it, we check it. It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Minatra. Now, do you want to schedule this, or not?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Standard procedure, as you say. I suppose there is no avoiding it. I… I will schedule the procedure. Please let me know what dates are available. I will need some time to arrange transportation and prepare myself, naturally. And if you could provide me with the contact information for the social worker, that would be most appreciated. Thank you for your patience, Doctor Todorovich. Despite my… numerous questions, I appreciate your candor, and I trust your expertise.
