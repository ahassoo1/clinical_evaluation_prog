DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you. I have been… how you say… wheezing. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes. Not all the time, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, alright. And when did this wheezing start, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Maybe… two weeks ago? It started slow, just a little bit when I walked fast. Now it is… more often. I do not remember exactly. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, approximately. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That is… difficult to say. I walk a lot, I like to keep moving. Maybe the heat? It has been very warm lately. Or maybe… the garden? I have been working in the garden, pulling weeds. Dust, perhaps? I do not know for sure. Everything feels harder these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, heat and gardening are potential factors. Do you notice the wheezing at any other times – when you're resting, for example, or when you're lying down?
PATIENT: No, not when I rest. I sleep okay. And when I sit, no problem. It is mostly when I do something. When I walk, or… try to do things around the house. It is not too bad, but it makes me stop and catch my breath. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, I understand. Have you experienced any cough accompanying the wheezing?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. A little cough. Not much, just a small one. Mostly when I try to breathe after the… the wheezing. It is not a bad cough, but it is there. It doesn't bring anything up, if you understand. Just… a dry cough.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dry cough accompanying the wheezing, mostly with exertion. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I haven’t really looked. Let me think… I wear sandals most of the time. Maybe a little? It’s hard to tell. I am… not as flexible as I used to be, you know. I do not check my feet so much. I don't think so, but I am not certain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been quite healthy, all my life. I walk every day, I eat good food. I had a fall last year, broke my wrist, but that is all. Nothing with my lungs. My husband, he had a cough sometimes, but I did not. He is… gone now. But I never had problems like this.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, never. Just the wrist. A simple break. They put it in a cast, and I was fine. I do not like hospitals, so I try to stay away. I prefer to keep busy, keep moving. That is the best medicine, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints, Doctor. They get stiff sometimes. It is… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. I do not take it every day, only when it hurts. And sometimes a vitamin, for older people. You know, the usual things. Nothing for my chest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I eat everything. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband, he was allergic to bee stings, but I am fine. I like flowers, I work in the garden. I am very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. I'd like to listen to your lungs now, and check your oxygen levels. Then we can decide what, if any, further investigation is needed. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. I am happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out. Okay… another deep breath. Wheezing is present bilaterally, diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Oxygen saturation is 92%. Now, I'm going to check your heart rate and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My heart is… okay, I think. I get a little breathless sometimes, but that is probably just my age. It is good you are checking, though. I like knowing things are alright.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88, slightly irregular. Given your age, the recent onset of wheezing, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I suspect this could be early signs of Congestive Heart Failure exacerbating mild COPD, although further testing is needed to confirm. It’s important to take this seriously. We'll need a chest X-ray and an EKG. I will also order a BNP blood test to check for heart strain.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Congestive… what did you say? And a test for my heart? I thought my lungs were the problem. Is it… bad? I just want to be able to walk in my garden. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: It means we need more information, Mrs. Kilton. Congestive Heart Failure doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is failing completely; it means it’s working harder than it should, causing fluid to back up into your lungs. This can cause shortness of breath and wheezing. The EKG will check your heart's rhythm, and the chest X-ray will show us if there's any fluid buildup. The BNP test is a blood test that indicates heart strain. It is important to rule out the possibility of a serious cardiac issue. We will schedule those tests today. I am also going to prescribe you a short course of Prednisone to help reduce inflammation in your airways, and a bronchodilator inhaler to open up your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Pred… prednisone? And an inhaler? Oh dear. That sounds like… a lot of medicine. I… I think so. Inflammation? Like… my joints? I do not understand so much. You said something about my heart… so it is not just my lungs? Is it… dangerous? Will I be able to walk in my garden still? I just… I do not want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, it is perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The prednisone will reduce swelling in your airways. The inhaler will help you breathe easier. Whether or not it's "just" your lungs depends on the results of the tests. It could be a heart problem causing the symptoms, or it could be a lung condition exacerbated by your heart. We need to determine the cause. The possibility of danger exists if left untreated. As for your garden, that will depend on your condition. We need to manage this. I'll write the prescriptions now. The nurse will explain how to use the inhaler. And we will schedule the tests immediately. I’ll also put in a referral to a cardiologist for a follow-up. Do you have any questions specifically about how to take the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a cardiologist? That sounds… very serious. I just want to feel better. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will this take? Will I be stuck in the hospital? And… will I still be able to see my grandchildren? That is all I really want, Doctor. To see my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, the tests are standard procedure. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart health – it doesn’t necessarily mean you have a severe problem. The tests will help us determine the best course of action. You will not be stuck in the hospital unless absolutely necessary. We are being proactive, that is all. The nurse will go over all the details. Here are your prescriptions. I recommend filling them as soon as possible. And I suggest focusing on getting the tests done. Do you have any further questions regarding the medication?
PATIENT: Oh… No, Doctor. I… I think I understand. Just… the tests. And the specialist. Thank you, Doctor. I will… I will see what the nurse says. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
