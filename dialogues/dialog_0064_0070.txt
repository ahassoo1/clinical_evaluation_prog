DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor... Smetak, yes? It’s… well, it’s a long story, really. I just moved here. New place. Need a doctor, you know? Medicare… they told me to come. Something about a check-up? It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A general check-up is a good place to start when you're establishing care with a new doctor, especially with Medicare. It is a lot to keep track of when you’re settling in somewhere new. Don't worry about the fuzziness; we'll take our time. So, besides establishing care, are you experiencing any specific health concerns or symptoms that you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Not really. I mean, old age comes with a few things, doesn’t it? My back aches a little. Always has. And sometimes… sometimes I forget things. But that's just… being my age, I think. Nothing to worry a doctor about. I make up for it with… talent, you know? I do makeup. For the theatre. Very important work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’re aware of what’s going on with your body. Back pain is common, and it's true, some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging. However, it's still important for me to get a good understanding of everything, just to be sure. Let’s start with the back pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: A little more… Well, it’s just… there. Always has been. It gets worse when I bend over, of course. Lots of bending in my work, you see? Reaching for brushes, powders… all sorts of things. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or anything. Just… a dull ache. It doesn't stop me from working, though. I'm a professional, you know. Very good at what I do. I used to work with… oh, what was her name? A very famous actress. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, it sounds like it's been bothering you for quite some time. And it doesn't seem to be getting significantly worse, just aggravated by your work?
PATIENT: Aggravated… yes, that’s a good word. It’s worse when I’m busy, you know? Long days, lots of pressure. Making people beautiful… it’s not as easy as it looks! You have to be precise. A little too much blush here, not enough shadow there… disaster! But it hasn’t stopped me yet. I'm very strong, despite my age. And the back pain… well, I just ignore it. Mostly. It's a small price to pay for my talent, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve learned to manage it. Now, you mentioned some forgetfulness earlier. Can you describe what that's like for you?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… little things. Where I put my glasses. What I had for breakfast. Names, sometimes. Not important names, usually. Like… the cashier at the store. Or the name of that actress. Not the famous one, the other one. It's frustrating, of course. But I’m not… losing my mind, if that’s what you’re thinking. I still remember how to apply eyeliner perfectly, and that’s what matters, isn't it? It's just… getting old. Everyone forgets things.
DOCTOR: It is common to experience some memory changes as we age, you're right. But it's good we're talking about it. Can you tell me how often you're experiencing these moments of forgetfulness?
PATIENT: How often… hmm. It’s hard to say. Some days it’s worse than others. If I’m tired, definitely worse. And if I’m stressed, you know? Opening night… very stressful! I worry about everything being perfect. That’s when it’s really bad. I might forget where I parked the car, or… what was I saying? Oh yes. Some days it’s just a few little things. Other days… well, other days I have to really think about it. But it doesn’t happen all the time. Not like in those movies, you know? I’m still… functional. Very functional. I’m a professional!
DOCTOR: Okay. That's helpful. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
PATIENT: Mood? Hmm. I get… irritated sometimes. Mostly at people who don’t understand art, you know? Or who don’t appreciate talent. And I get… sad, sometimes. Thinking about the old days. The famous actress… she’s not with us anymore. But mostly, I'm okay. I have my work. That keeps me going. And I’m not one for complaining, you know? Life is too short to be miserable. Besides, complaining doesn’t solve anything. Does that answer your question? I sometimes forget what you’ve asked already… it’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers my question perfectly, thank you. It’s understandable to feel a bit sad when thinking about the past, and frustration with memory is very common. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I saw a doctor in Russia, of course. Many years ago. They gave me… pills, I think. For my blood pressure, maybe? It was high. But I stopped taking them. They made me feel… strange. I don't remember much else, to be honest. It was so long ago. And the doctors in Russia… they didn’t explain things very well. Not like you do. I think I had a little trouble with my heart once, a long time ago, but it cleared up on its own. Mostly, I just try to stay healthy. I eat… mostly. And I work. That’s good exercise, you know. Do you need a list of the famous people I’ve worked with? I could write that down. It’s very impressive.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It sounds like things were a bit unclear a long time ago. We don’t need a list of names right now. Knowing that you had some trouble with blood pressure and possibly your heart in the past is helpful. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I take something for my back, when it’s really bad. I get it from the drugstore. Ibuprofen, maybe? It helps a little. And sometimes I take something for my sleep, when I can’t sleep. But not very often. It makes me feel… foggy, you know? I don’t remember the name of it. It’s a little blue pill, I think. But mostly, I try to avoid taking pills. They’re not good for you. My mother always said that. Do you want me to find the bottle? It’s somewhere in the bathroom, I think. It’s very cluttered in there… I need to tidy it up. I’m very busy, you know.
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about finding the bottle right now. Knowing you take ibuprofen occasionally and something for sleep is enough for now. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long, long time ago. It was very painful, I remember that. And… I think I was in the hospital once, when I broke my arm. I was playing football with my friends. A foolish thing to do, really. I was very young. Besides that… I don’t think so. I’ve been very lucky, actually. I’ve managed to avoid serious illness, mostly. I believe in taking care of myself. And… well, I’m a strong person. That helps, you know. Do you think my talent has anything to do with it? I’ve always been very artistic. It’s very… healing, actually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, just a couple more questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives—parents, siblings—have had any health problems like heart disease, diabetes, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she died when I was very young. I don’t remember much about her. My father… he was a strong man, but he drank a lot. I think he had some trouble with his heart, maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t really know. And I don’t have any siblings. I was an only child. We didn’t talk about health much in my family. It was… not important. We were artists, you see? We focused on beauty, not illness. Do you think that’s a bad thing? I always thought it was a good thing. It’s better to focus on the positive, don’t you think? I’m very good at focusing on the positive. It’s a talent, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like health wasn’t a major topic of discussion in your family. That’s alright. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I was allergic to something when I was a child. Pollen, maybe? I sneezed a lot in the spring. But I grew out of it, I think. I don't have any food allergies. I eat everything. I’m Russian, you know. We eat a lot of different things. And I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications. I haven’t had any bad reactions, as far as I can remember. Although… sometimes I get a little dizzy when I take those blue pills for my sleep. But that might just be because they’re strong. I don’t really pay much attention to it. I’m not one for worrying about little things. Is that a bad thing? I always thought it was a good thing. It’s better to focus on the positive, don’t you think? I’m very good at focusing on the positive. It’s a talent, actually. Do you want to see some pictures of my work? I could show you. It’s very impressive.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you haven’t had any significant allergies. And no, it’s not a bad thing to focus on the positive. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I think that covers most of the important questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a very busy schedule, you know. I need to get back to work. And I don't like doctors poking and prodding. But if you must, I suppose you must. Just be gentle, alright? And don’t expect me to undress. I’m a professional, you know. I have a reputation to maintain. What exactly will you be doing? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No surprises, I promise. We'll start with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I may feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness. And I’ll check your reflexes. I won't ask you to undress completely, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs will require me to lift your shirt. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Lift my shirt… oh dear. Very well. As long as it’s quick. And you must be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. I’m a professional! People pay good money for this skin. And please, don’t stare. It’s very impolite. And don’t poke too hard. I bruise easily. And… what exactly are you looking for? I don't want you to find anything unpleasant. It will ruin my reputation. Are you sure you can’t just skip that part? I’m very busy, you know. I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous actress. Well, she used to be famous. But still… very important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. I’m just checking to make sure everything is functioning as it should. We'll be quick, and I will be very respectful. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your arm resting on the table?
PATIENT: Very well. But don't squeeze too tightly, alright? It’s very uncomfortable. And please, be quick. I have a very busy schedule, you know. I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous… well, she used to be famous. But still… important. Are you sure you’re a good doctor? My mother always said… well, never mind. Just be quick, alright? And be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax for a moment. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated. We’ll talk about that later. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Would you mind taking a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Is it serious? I knew I shouldn't have come here. I'm a very busy man, you know. I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous… well, never mind. Just get it over with, alright? And please, be gentle. Very gentle. I have a sensitive chest. My mother always said… well, it doesn’t matter. Just hurry up, alright? And don’t stare! It’s very impolite.
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a bit fast, but regular. I hear some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be from a number of things. It's not necessarily cause for alarm, but we'll need to investigate further. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your ears.
PATIENT: Crackling? What does that mean? Is it serious? Is it my lungs? Am I going to get sick? I can’t get sick! I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous actress. She needs me to do her makeup! It’s very important! Are you sure you’re a good doctor? My mother always said… well, it doesn’t matter. Just hurry up, alright? And please, be careful! I have sensitive ears, too! They’re very important for my work. I need to hear everything!
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. Your ears look clear. No signs of infection. Everything looks normal in your ears. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? Is something wrong with my legs? Am I going to lose my balance? I need my balance! I’m a professional, you know! I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous actress! She needs me to do her makeup! It’s very important! Are you sure you’re a good doctor? My mother always said… well, it doesn’t matter. Just hurry up, alright? And please, don’t hit my legs too hard! They’re very important for my work! I need to be able to stand for long periods of time!
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but nothing to be overly concerned about right now. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what I’ve heard and observed, your blood pressure is elevated, your heart rate is a bit fast, and your reflexes are a little slow. The crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things, such as a mild cold or allergies. I want to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A chest X-ray? What for? Is something seriously wrong? Am I going to die? I can’t die! I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous actress! She needs me to do her makeup! It’s very important! And I don’t like needles! I faint at the sight of needles! And X-rays… are they safe? My mother always said… well, it doesn’t matter. I don’t want any tests! I’m fine! I just need to relax! I’m a professional, you know! This is all very stressful! Can’t I just take some pills? That’s what I usually do. Please, just give me some pills! And don't tell me I have to come back! I have a very busy schedule!
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Szmyd. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about tests. But these tests are just to help me get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out anything serious. The blood tests will give us information about your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The chest X-ray will help me see if there's anything going on in your lungs. The blood tests are quick and relatively painless. They only involve a small needle prick. And the chest X-ray is safe, it uses a very low dose of radiation. I wouldn't recommend just taking pills without knowing what's going on. That could mask the symptoms and make it harder to diagnose the problem. I would like you to come back for a follow-up appointment after the tests are done, so we can discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A treatment plan? What does that even mean? Am I sick? Am I going to have to take a lot of pills? And come back? Ugh. I really don't want to come back. I have a very important appointment later. With a very famous actress! She really needs me. But... if it's the only way to make sure I can do her makeup... alright. Fine. But I want a quick appointment. And no needles! And no complicated tests! Just... the simplest things possible. And can you promise me I won't have to take a lot of pills? My mother always said... well, never mind. Just tell me how to get these tests done. And please, be quick about it. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll keep things as simple as possible. I'll write you a referral for a blood test at the lab across the street. They'll only need a small sample of your blood. And I'll also give you a request for a chest X-ray at the imaging center next door. It's a quick and painless procedure. The lab and imaging center both accept Medicare, so you shouldn't have any issues with coverage. Once you've had the tests done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me. We'll discuss the results and create a treatment plan if necessary. I promise we'll keep the plan as simple as possible. Here are the forms. The lab and imaging center are both open Monday through Friday, 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. You can call them to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the forms or the tests?
PATIENT: So… I just take these to those places? And they’ll… poke me? And take my blood? Ugh. This is terrible. Is there… is there anything else I need to know? What if I faint? What if they lose my blood? What if the X-ray machine breaks? And… what if the actress fires me because I’m sick? She’s very demanding, you know. Very, very demanding. I really don’t want to do this. But… alright. Fine. I’ll try. But if anything goes wrong, I’m blaming you. And I want a discount! This is all very stressful! And if I have to take any pills, I want a free makeup session with the actress! She’s very famous, you know. Very, very famous. Just… get me out of here. I need to go practice my eyeliner. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Just remember, these tests are just to help me make sure you're healthy enough to continue doing what you love. The lab technicians and radiologists are very professional and will take good care of you. I can assure you, the lab and imaging center have all the necessary safety measures in place. And I’m confident everything will go smoothly. As for the discount and free makeup session... we can discuss that if necessary after we get the test results. Alright, well, I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And please, do try to relax and practice your eyeliner. It sounds like you're very talented. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But if anything goes wrong… I’m blaming you. And I want a discount! And a free makeup session!
