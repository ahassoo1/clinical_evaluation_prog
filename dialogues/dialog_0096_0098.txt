DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor... Burlingham, right? Yeah, well, I just… wanted to check things out, you know? I ain't really sick sick. More like… curious. Been workin' on the boats a while, and figured it was time to see if everything's still okay inside. Never really had a proper check-up before, honestly. Just kinda wanted to make sure nothin' was goin' wrong without me knowin'.
DOCTOR: "Curious," is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds kinda silly when I say it out loud, don't it? But seriously, I spend a lot of time breathin' in… boat air, and liftin' heavy stuff. Just wanna be safe, you know? Especially after gettin' divorced… gotta take care of myself now. I got Medicare, so figured I might as well use it while I got it.
DOCTOR: Well, it's not silly at all to be proactive about your health, Mr. Heindel. Though, I must say, "boat air" isn't a medical term I hear often. But alright, we can certainly do a general check-up. It's good you’re thinking ahead, especially with changes in your personal life. Let’s start with a bit of your history. Have you ever been seriously ill with anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… seriously ill? Not really, I don’t think. Had the usual colds and flus, you know? When I was a kid, I got chickenpox, but that was a long time ago. Never been to the hospital for anything big. Mostly just bumps and bruises from workin' on the boats. I mean, a few stitches here and there… But nothin’ that kept me down for long. I always bounced back pretty quick. Does stitches count as “serious”? I ain’t sure.
DOCTOR: Stitches, no. We're looking for things like pneumonia, serious infections, major injuries... things that would require hospitalization. Alright, so no significant illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. Never needed 'em. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Both my parents were pretty healthy folks too, mostly just… old age stuff with them. They're both gone now. So, no hospitals, no surgeries. Just hard work and… well, boat air. Is that somethin' you can even check for, Doctor? What is boat air, anyway? I always wondered.
DOCTOR: "Boat air" is… not a defined medical condition, Mr. Heindel. But we can certainly assess your respiratory health. It likely contains various fumes and particles. Alright, moving on. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Respiratory health... okay. That makes sense, I guess. Family history... hmm. My momma, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my daddy, he had somethin' with his heart. Not sure exactly what, it was a long time ago. They didn’t really talk about that kinda stuff much back then. And... uh... my grandma on my momma’s side, she had… diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago too. Mostly just old age stuff, like I said. I don't think nobody really died of anything young. Mostly just wore out, you know?
DOCTOR: "Wore out" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Heindel. But alright. High blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes in your family. We’ll need to keep those in mind. Now, tell me about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I don’t smoke. Never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, didn't like it. Makes you cough too much. Not good for a sailor, right? I do drink sometimes… a beer or two after work, maybe on the weekends. Nothin' crazy. I mostly just like relaxin' and watchin' TV, you know? Ain't much of a party animal. I used to go fishin' a lot, but haven't had time lately. Work keeps me pretty busy.
DOCTOR: So, occasional alcohol use, no smoking. Good. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine. When I was a kid, my momma used to give me all kinds of stuff when I was sick, and I never had no problems. I think I got stung by a bee once, but that wasn’t an allergy allergy, just a regular sting. Swelled up a bit, but it went away pretty quick. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, ma'am. Not that I've ever noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not takin' nothin'. I don't really like takin' pills, if I can avoid it. I try to just tough things out, you know? If I got a headache, I just drink some water and lay down. If I got a cold, I just rest. I don’t believe in all that medicine unless I really need it. That's why I'm here, right? To see if I need somethin'? Not to start takin' a bunch of pills I don’t want.
DOCTOR: Very well. No medications. Let's move on to a physical exam, then. I'd like to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature—and listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just lie down on the table, we’ll get started.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Heart and lungs... that's good, right? Makin' sure everything's okay. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I ain’t never had a proper physical before, so I'm kinda new to this. Go ahead when you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 140 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Not terrible, but your blood pressure is a little elevated. Heart sounds… normal, although slightly rapid. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? That don't sound good, does it? Ooh, yeah, a little. Not bad bad, just… kinda feels tight. Like somebody’s squeezin' my chest a little. It happens sometimes, especially after liftin' heavy stuff. I figured it was just my muscles, you know? From the work. Is that somethin' serious, Doctor? Should I be worried about that “diminished” sound?
DOCTOR: "Diminished" sounds aren't necessarily serious, but they do require further investigation. The tightness you're feeling, coupled with the reduced airflow, could indicate a number of things. It could be something as simple as muscle strain, but it could also be an early sign of bronchitis, or even something more concerning. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. And I'd also like to order a complete blood count—just to rule out any infection. Don't panic, Mr. Heindel. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? And blood work? That sounds… kinda serious, don't it? I mean, I just came in for a check-up, not to find out I was dyin’ or somethin’. Is it somethin’ I did? Like… from the boat work? I just figured it was muscles, like I said. I don’t like hospitals, Doctor. And I really don’t like findin’ out what’s wrong with me. Can’t we just… wait and see? Maybe it’ll go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, with all due respect, “waiting and seeing” is not a sound medical strategy. You're experiencing symptoms that warrant investigation. And frankly, the fact that your blood pressure is elevated is also concerning. We need to rule out any potential problems before they become serious. The X-ray and blood work will give us the information we need to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan, if necessary. It's a simple procedure, it won't take long, and it’s much better to be proactive than to ignore the problem and risk complications later on. I understand your anxiety, but I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes thorough diagnostic testing. Do you have any questions about the procedures?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. You’re right, I guess. Shouldn’t just ignore it. But… what if it is somethin’ bad? What kinda things are we lookin’ for with this… X-ray? And this blood work… will it hurt? I just… I don’t wanna know if I’m sick, you know? I’ve been workin' so hard, tryin’ to take care of myself after the divorce… findin' out somethin's wrong with me… it just feels… bad.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, I understand your fear. It's natural to be anxious about the unknown. Let me assure you, we're not looking for anything to be wrong. We’re simply gathering information to ensure your health and well-being. The X-ray is painless – it’s just a quick scan of your chest. And the blood work will involve a simple needle prick – it’s a bit uncomfortable, but it’s over quickly. As for what we’re looking for, the X-ray will allow us to check for any signs of infection, fluid buildup, or abnormalities in your lungs. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. The vast majority of the time, these tests come back normal. But it’s important to be thorough, especially considering your symptoms and slightly elevated blood pressure. I will explain the results to you in detail, and we will discuss the best course of action, if necessary. I'll be here every step of the way to answer your questions and provide support. Would you like me to go over the procedure details again?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that sounds… better, I guess. Explainin' it makes it seem less scary. No, I think I got it. X-ray… quick picture. Blood work… needle. Not fun, but quick. When can I get this done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I gotta get back to work, you know? Can’t be gone too long. Hopefully, it ain't somethin' serious that keeps me from workin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. The clinic has an X-ray machine on-site, so we can get that done immediately, after I finish this consultation. The blood work can also be done right here. It'll take about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw itself. The results, unfortunately, will take a few days to come back. Usually, we get them within 2-3 business days. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. I understand your concerns about work. I will do my best to expedite the process. And I will provide you with a note explaining that you were here for a medical evaluation, if your employer requires it. In the meantime, try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And if you experience any worsening symptoms—such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… get it over with, I guess. Two to three days… that seems like a long time. But… okay. Just tell me what I gotta do. Let's get this X-ray done.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse, Melissa, will be in shortly to escort you to the X-ray department and draw your blood. She’ll explain the process in detail and answer any questions you may have. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Try not to worry too much, Mr. Heindel. We're doing everything we can to ensure your health and well-being. Melissa will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
