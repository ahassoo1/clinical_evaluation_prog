DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… somethin’ in the stuff I cough up. Red. Like… blood. Not a lot, but it’s there. I smoke, you know. Been a long time. Don’t remember exactly how long. Long enough.
DOCTOR: Right. A cough with hemoptysis – coughing up blood. You said you smoke, and have for a “long time.” Can you be a bit more specific about how long, Mr. Reyno?
PATIENT: Specific…? Honestly? No. Not really. A lot of years. Since I was… young. Before my wife… before things got… hard. Does it matter? It’s just a cough, right? A smoker’s cough.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Reyno. While a smoker’s cough is common, hemoptysis always warrants investigation. We need to rule out other possibilities. Do you recall when you first noticed the blood in your sputum?
PATIENT: Sputum…? The… stuff I cough up? When…? A few weeks, maybe? A month? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just… regular cough. Other times… not so regular. Look, I ain’t good with dates. Sorry. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, I understand you’re busy, but we need to gather some information to ensure we're addressing the correct problem. “A few weeks to a month” is helpful, but I also need to ask some more detailed questions. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever…? Not that I noticed. Chills… sometimes I get cold, but that’s just the… air conditioning. Weight loss… maybe? Hard to say. I eat when I can. Night sweats… Now that you mention it… maybe. I wake up kinda… damp sometimes. But I figured it was just the heat. It gets hot, you know? Everything feels damp then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dampness at night, possible weight loss, no fever you’ve noticed. Do you have any chest pain, shortness of breath, or wheezing with your cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really pain, but kinda… tight sometimes. Like somethin’ heavy sittin’ there. Shortness of breath… only when I really push myself. Like walkin’ up a hill. And… yeah, I wheeze. Always have, I think. Especially when I cough bad. It's… part of it, I guess. Like a rusty engine. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Reyno. A rusty engine is a good description. Now, regarding your past medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with pneumonia, bronchitis, tuberculosis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: Lung conditions…? Uh… the doctor… back when my wife was… sick… he gave me somethin’ for a cough. A long time ago. Maybe bronchitis? I don’t remember the name of it. Tuberculosis…? No, I don't think so. Never heard nothin’ about that. I mostly just… ignore it ‘til it gets bad and then go see a doctor. That’s how I always did it. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Reyno. Ignoring symptoms can sometimes allow problems to worsen. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members—parents, siblings, children—who have had lung problems, cancer, or tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Family… My mom… she had… somethin’ bad. With her breathin’. Had to use a machine. Not cancer, I don't think. Just… sick. My dad… he worked in the mines. Lots of dust. He coughed a lot towards the end. Never said what it was. No kids… my wife and I… didn't have any. This is… hard to remember. Sorry. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just… when my back acts up I take somethin' from the store. Ibuprofen, I think. And sometimes… cough drops. But that’s it. I don’t like takin’ pills. Never did. Makes me feel… weird. Medicare pays for it, so I get whatever they tell me to. But I don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications other than occasional ibuprofen and cough drops. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most things. Dust bothers me sometimes, but that's not an allergy, right? It just… makes me cough. Been that way my whole life. Are we almost done? I got a appointment I need to get to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I'm going to need to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and feel your lymph nodes. It shouldn’t take long. Afterwards, I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Look, I don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. And I really don’t like bein’ in those machines. But… I guess. If you think it's important. Just… make it quick, okay? And tell me what you find. I don't want no fancy words, just… what’s wrong. If anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth… and exhale slowly. Okay. And again. I hear some wheezing, as you mentioned, and some crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I feel some slight swelling in the lymph nodes in your neck. It’s not significantly concerning, but warrants further investigation. Now, we'll proceed with the chest X-ray. I'll have the technician explain the procedure to you. We need to rule out pneumonia, bronchitis, or anything more serious.
PATIENT: Crackles…? Swellin…? See, this is what I don't like. It’s always somethin’. Just… tell me straight. Is it bad? Is it the cough? Is it… somethin’ worse? I just wanna know. No fancy words, okay? Just tell me what I'm lookin' at.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. The crackles in your lungs and the slight swelling in your lymph nodes could indicate an infection like pneumonia or bronchitis, which we can check for with the X-ray. However, they could also be signs of something more serious, like a lung mass or other underlying condition. That’s why the X-ray is so important. I want to be upfront with you – because of your history of smoking and the blood in your sputum, we need to rule out the possibility of lung cancer. The X-ray will give us a much clearer picture, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly once we have them. I'm not trying to alarm you, but I want you to be fully informed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lung… cancer…? I… I see. So… it could be… really bad? Like… the end? I… I don’t even know what to say. My wife… she… Just… do the X-ray. Just tell me what it says. And… please… don't use fancy words. .
