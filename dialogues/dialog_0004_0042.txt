DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I'm gettin' up there in years and figured it's time to make sure everything's still tickin' right, you know? A friend of mine, Earl, he came here a while back and said you do a good job of… well, keepin' fellas optimized, he called it. That sounded alright to me. Just want to make sure I'm doin' okay.
DOCTOR: Right. A “check-up,” then. It’s… good you're being proactive. Though, frankly, most people come when something is wrong, not just to be “optimized.” Let's start with a basic history. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Nothin' I can put my finger on, anyways. Just feelin'…old sometimes, I suppose. A little slower to get up in the mornin', that kinda thing. My knees creak a bit more than they used to, but I figure that's just the weather. I still get out and do a little work, though. Etchin’ keeps me busy. Don't want to be one of those folks who just sits around, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right. So, no pain specifically, just general stiffness and slower movement. And this has been… how long?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know exactly. Seems like it’s been creepin' up on me for… a couple of years, maybe? Hard to say for sure. I didn't pay much attention to it at first. It's just a natural part of gettin’ older, I always figured. I’m not one to complain unless somethin’ really bothers me. My wife, bless her heart, she always said I was too stubborn for my own good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And outside of this general stiffness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My sleep ain’t what it used to be. Wake up a couple of times a night, gotta get up and… well, you know. Just a man thing, I reckon. And I get a little… forgetful sometimes, but I always figured that was just part of gettin' old too. Though, my daughter keeps tellin’ me I’m repeatin’ myself. She’s probably right. It's hard to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, difficulty sleeping – how many times a night, roughly, are you waking up?
PATIENT: Usually just once, maybe twice. I can usually get back to sleep alright, it just…takes a little longer. I don’t lie awake for hours or nothin'. Just… restless, I guess. And sometimes I dream a whole lot. Weird dreams. Not nightmares, exactly, just… vivid. Remind me of things from a long time ago. My wife used to say I had a good imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite’s a little smaller than it used to be. I don't crave things like I once did. I used to be able to put away a whole mess of food, but now… a smaller portion fills me up. As for weight... I reckon I’ve lost a few pounds, but nothin’ drastic. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, truth be told. I ain’t one for numbers, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Nope, not a bit. No chest pain, and I can breathe just fine. Maybe a little winded when I’m workin' in the garden, but that's just from bendin’ and stoopin’. And my ankles and feet are alright, no swellin’. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. I guess I just need to make sure I stay that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I take a little somethin’ for my blood pressure, that’s about it. A small dose, Doctor Ramirez prescribed it a few years back. Otherwise, I’m pretty good. I try to eat healthy, don’t smoke, and only have a little bit of whiskey now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about past medical problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had pneumonia when I was a boy, real bad. But that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once fallin’ out of a tree. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been a pretty strong fella. Had my share of scrapes and bruises workin’, but nothin’ serious. My wife, she had a little trouble with her gallbladder years back, but I don’t think that counts as mine. I've been lucky, I guess. Real lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a bit of a story. My mama, she lived a long life, but she had a little trouble with her heart towards the end. My daddy, he was a strong fella, but he passed away young from a bad accident. And my brother...he had some trouble with diabetes, real bad. It took him too soon. The Cherokee Nation’s had a tough time with that one for a long time. It seems to run in the family, that sickness. I try to stay careful, eat right, but… you never know, do ya?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? Well, I don't go out much anymore, not since my wife passed. I used to enjoy a good fishin’ trip with Earl, but he moved away a few years back. I mostly just keep to myself, work on my etchings, and visit my daughter and grandkids when I can. They keep me young, those grandkids. We play checkers, watch ball games… good times. I don’t drink much anymore, just a little whiskey now and then to help me sleep. Mostly I just try to stay busy and out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammann. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. Just to check things out. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a few other basic things. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what you need me to do. I ain’t afraid of a little pokin’ and proddin’. Been to doctors enough in my life, I reckon.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just have a seat here, and loosen your shirt. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Alright. Always did like listenin' to my own heartbeat. Reminds me I'm still here, ya know? Used to race motorcycles when I was younger. That'll get your heart pumpin', I tell ya! Not so much these days, though. Gettin' too old for all that excitement.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm not hearing any murmurs or unusual sounds with your heart, but your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower lobes. Not alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Any pain here at all?
PATIENT: Nope, not a bit. Never had much trouble with my stomach. I reckon I’ve got a pretty strong constitution. Always ate whatever was put in front of me, didn't matter much what it was. Used to work on a ranch when I was younger. Ate beans and biscuits for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Built a man, those beans did. Maybe a little gas sometimes, but that's just part of gettin’ older, ya know?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to check your feet. Your feet are in good shape, no swelling or sores. Good circulation. I’ll just check your ears and throat now. Ears and throat look clear. No signs of infection. Alright, Mr. Kammann, that completes the physical exam. It was all pretty unremarkable, all things considered. But I do want to order a few lab tests just to get a better baseline.
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' your time and lookin' me over. Never hurts to be careful, I reckon. What kinda tests are we talkin' about? Blood work? Anything else? I’m hopin’ it ain’t nothin’ too serious. Just want to make sure I can keep workin' on my etchings for a little while longer, ya know? It keeps me goin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. And I'd also like to do a urinalysis to rule out any infection. I'll also order a chest X-ray, just to get a better look at those diminished breath sounds I noticed. You can take these to the lab downstairs. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It’ll probably be in about a week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds just fine, Doctor. A week gives me plenty of time to get things done. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll head down to the lab right after this. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Fasting or anything like that? Just want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, for the lipid panel, you’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drinks – except water – after midnight tonight. The urinalysis doesn’t require any special preparation. Just try to provide a mid-stream sample, if possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Nope, I think I got it. No food after midnight, just water. And a mid-stream sample for the… what did you call it? The urine test. I used to be pretty good at followin’ instructions when I was younger. Still am, I reckon. Just gotta remember it all. I’ll write it down when I get home. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been a big help. I'll head down to the lab now, and I'll see you in a week.
DOCTOR: Very good. And Mr. Kammann, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever – please don’t hesitate to call my office immediately. Don't wait for your appointment. Alright. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate your concern. I will definitely let you know if anything changes. You have a good day too, and thanks again for everything. I'll be seein' ya.
