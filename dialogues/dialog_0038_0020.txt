DOCTOR: Good morning, Avril. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth visit, yes? My… the lady on the phone, she say come for talk. It is for my… check-up, I think. I am… not so sure what is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Sometimes these appointments get scheduled a little vaguely. Yes, it looks like you're here for a comprehensive check-up, a general health assessment. We'll just go over a few things – how you've been feeling, any concerns you have, and a bit of your medical history. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I am… feeling mostly okay. A little tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But nothing… serious, I think. What do you want to know first?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Let's start with this tiredness then. When did you start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It comes and goes. Some days I have much energy, I can work in the garage all day. Other days… I need to sit, rest. It is not… sudden. Just… slower, you know? Like a… a light dimming, not turning off. Is that… how you say?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a very good way to describe it – a gradual dimming. So, it’s been about six months, coming and going, and doesn’t interfere with everything you do, but does impact your energy levels. Are there any particular times of day it’s worse?
PATIENT: Mostly… in the afternoon. Morning is good. I wake up… okay. But after lunch… it is hard. I try to drink coffee, but it does not… help so much anymore. And after I work… the garage… it is very tiring. My hands, my back… and I feel sleepy. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. It helps us understand what might be going on. So, fatigue worsening in the afternoon, not improved by coffee, and exacerbated by physical activity like working in the garage. And you're experiencing some hand and back discomfort along with the fatigue. Do you feel any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Sometimes… my knees. Not always. When it rains… they ache. Old injury, from… many years ago. Football, when I was young. And… sometimes a little in my shoulder. But mostly… the knees and the garage work. Is this football… important? I do not play anymore, of course.
DOCTOR: It is, thank you. Knowing about the football injury helps give us context. So, just to clarify, the knee pain is more related to weather changes, and you’ve had shoulder discomfort too. Is that shoulder discomfort constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Usually after… lifting something heavy. Or… when I am reaching for tools in the garage. It is not… terrible pain. Just… a little ache. I take… what is it called… ibuprofen, sometimes. It helps. Do you… need to know what kind of ibuprofen? There are many, yes?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. Knowing it's related to activity and relieved by ibuprofen is helpful. And no, don’t worry about the specific type of ibuprofen for now. Let’s stick with the overall picture. Now, apart from the fatigue, knee discomfort, and shoulder aches, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I am… forgetting things. Not big things. Like… where I put my glasses. Or… the name of a tool. Little things. It happens more often… lately. Is this… a worry? My husband, he always say I am forgetful. But he is gone now. Maybe it is just… old age.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Avril. Changes in memory, even small ones, are important to talk about. And you’re right, it’s good you’re aware of it. You said it's been happening more recently. Could you give me an example of what you mean by "more recently?
PATIENT: Maybe… the last few months? Like… I went to the store for milk, and I forgot what else I needed. Or… I started to fix the car, and I forgot which part I was looking for. Small things. Nothing… like not knowing where I am. Just… little slips. It is… annoying, more than scary. Is that… making sense? It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Avril. It sounds like you’re very aware of what’s going on, and it’s more of a frustrating inconvenience than anything else, at this point. And you are doing very well explaining it. So, these memory slips are relatively recent, happening over the last few months, and not affecting your overall awareness or ability to function?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. I can still drive. I can still cook. I can still fix cars, mostly. It just… takes longer, sometimes. And I have to… think harder. Is that… a bad sign? I do not want to… lose my mind, you know? My mother… she had… problems, when she got old. I do not want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Avril, and it's good you're being proactive about it. It's natural to be worried, especially given your mother's experience. What you're describing doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. Many things can cause temporary memory lapses, and it doesn't automatically mean you're heading down the same path as your mother. Now, let’s switch gears for a moment. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat… okay. Not much different. I like to cook, so I make sure I have good food. Maybe… I eat a little less in the summer, it is hot. But nothing… dramatic. And my weight… is the same, I think. I do not… weigh myself often. Is that… important too? I always been… solid.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It's helpful that your appetite and weight have been stable. It is important. Changes in those things can sometimes give us clues. You mentioned being "solid" - are you generally at a stable weight for you?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. I gain a little in the winter, lose a little in the summer. But… it is always about the same. I do not… worry about my weight. I just want to… feel good. I always been… a big girl, you know? My mother, she was very thin. But I am… strong. For my age. I can still lift the engine parts, mostly. It is… hard, but I can do it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It sounds like you’ve maintained a good level of physical function, and that's excellent. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any long-term health conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband, he was the one who took care of all the doctor things. I went with him, but… I do not remember much. I had… the usual things, you know? Cold, flu. But nothing… serious. The doctor, he told me once I had… a little high blood pressure. But he gave me pills, and it went away. I do not take them anymore. I think. Is that… helpful? I am very bad at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we'll sort it out together. So, possible history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication and is no longer being taken. Do you remember what kind of medication it was, or how long you took it for?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name. Small, white pill, I think. I took it for… a few years, maybe? The doctor, he said it was good to take it. But when my husband… he took over everything. He reminded me to take the pills. After he… I just stopped, I think. I feel… okay. I do not feel… different. Is that… bad? Should I be… worried? I am so sorry, I am very bad at this.
DOCTOR: You're not bad at all, Avril. It's perfectly normal to forget details, especially after a loss. It sounds like the medication was helpful at the time, and you haven’t noticed any problems since stopping it, which is good. We can always check your blood pressure today, just to see where it's at. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think very carefully. Yes! I had… my appendix out, when I was young. A long time ago. And… I had a… a hip replacement. Maybe ten years ago? It was… sore, very sore. But it is… better now. I can walk, mostly. I do not need a cane. Is that… important? It hurt very bad, after the surgery. But the doctor, he said it was normal.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very important, thank you. Both the appendectomy and the hip replacement. You mentioned it was painful after the surgery but is better now and you don’t require a cane. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I can eat everything. I do not have… rashes, or… trouble breathing. I take… sometimes, I take ibuprofen, for my shoulder. And… sometimes I take something for a cold. But nothing… serious. I do not remember… any bad reactions. My husband, he always asked me, when the doctor asked. I do not know… if I am allergic to anything. Is that… bad? Should I be… worried about that too?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily bad. It's good you haven't experienced any reactions to medications you’ve taken. It’s better to be cautious. We’ll just make a note that we haven’t confirmed any specific allergies. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members have had any significant health problems, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had… problems with her heart, when she got old. She was very thin, always. And… my father, he had… cancer. Lung cancer. He smoked, a lot. And my brother, he had… diabetes. He ate too much sugar, I think. Is that… helpful? They are… gone now, both of them. I do not know… much about their medical things. My husband, he took care of all that. I am so sorry, I am very bad at remembering. I wish I could… be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Avril. You’re doing the best you can, and that’s all I ask. Knowing about the heart problems, cancer, and diabetes in your family is good information. It helps us understand your risk factors a little better. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything you want to discuss or anything that’s been bothering you that we haven’t covered?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I do not think so. Maybe… I feel… lonely, sometimes. After my husband… it is very quiet. But that is… not a doctor thing, I think. I go to church, I have some friends. But it is… different. I just… miss him. Is that… okay to say? I feel silly, talking about this to a doctor. I thought you wanted to know about… my body, not my… feelings. I am sorry, I am rambling.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Avril. And it is absolutely okay to say. Your emotional well-being is just as important as your physical health, and it’s perfectly acceptable to talk about how you’re feeling. It sounds like you're experiencing some loneliness after your husband's passing, and that's completely understandable. We can certainly discuss resources for support groups or counseling if you'd like. But for now, let's focus on your physical health. We'll do a quick exam, just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. I am ready. Please… be gentle. My bones… they are old, you know? And… thank you for listening. It is… nice to talk to someone.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. We'll take things slowly. And you're very welcome. That’s what I'm here for. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Here you are. I hope it is not… too high. I worry about everything, you know? It is an old habit. But… please, do not worry too much. I am sure it is… okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Avril, I'm just going to inflate this cuff, and it will squeeze your arm for a moment. It doesn’t hurt, but it might feel a little tight. Just relax, and breathe normally. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated. We'll want to monitor that over time. Nothing to panic about, but it's good to know. Next, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… okay? I do not breathe so good, sometimes. My chest… it feels a little tight. Old age, you know? And… I hope I am not making too much noise. I do not want to bother you.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Avril. Don’t worry about bothering me at all. Your breathing does sound a little wheezy, but it’s not alarming. It could be due to a number of things, and we'll investigate further if needed. I'm hearing a normal heart rhythm, though. No murmurs or extra sounds. Now, let’s just check your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Your pulses are a little weak, but present in all four limbs. That's not unusual, especially if you're not very active. Now, let's take a look at your throat and ears. Can you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Here you are. I hope there are no… monsters in there. I always worry about everything, you know? My husband, he always laugh at me. But… it is just an old habit. Is everything… okay? Do you see anything… bad? I do not want to… get sick.
DOCTOR: Everything looks perfectly normal, Avril. No signs of any infection or inflammation. Your throat is a little dry, but that’s common. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears. Your ears are clear as well. No signs of any fluid or wax build-up. That’s good. Now, let’s just check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the bed?
PATIENT: Here I am. I hope I do not fall. My balance… is not so good, you know? Old age, I suppose. Please… be careful with me. I do not want to… make a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your leg, and let it hang loose. I’m just going to tap your knee with this hammer. Don’t worry, it doesn’t hurt. Good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s common with age. Now let's do the other leg. And that's it. That was a quick exam. Everything seems generally okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your reflexes are a bit diminished, but nothing that's immediately concerning. Now, do you have any specific concerns or symptoms that you want to discuss further?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Maybe… the loneliness. But you said it is not a doctor thing, I know. I just… miss my husband. And I worry about everything, you know? It is an old habit. But… thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Is there… anything I need to do? Should I take some pills? Or… see a specialist?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. And you are right, the loneliness isn't necessarily a "doctor thing," but it's important to acknowledge it. We can talk about resources for support groups if you'd like, or I can provide you with some information on counseling services. For now, let’s focus on your blood pressure. I’d like you to monitor it at home for a week. You can get a simple blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keep a record of your readings and bring it with you when you come back for a follow-up appointment. I don’t think you need to see a specialist right now, but if your blood pressure remains elevated, or if you start experiencing any new symptoms, we’ll reconsider that. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And… thank you for being so kind. I feel… better, just talking to someone. A follow-up appointment? How long should I wait? And… where do I go? I always forget everything, you know. Perhaps a little note would be helpful. And… thank you again. You are a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I'm glad I could help. Let's schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, on August 16th. That'll give you plenty of time to monitor your blood pressure. You can schedule it with the receptionist on your way out. I'm going to write down a note for you right now with the date and time of your appointment, as well as instructions for monitoring your blood pressure. I’ll also include some information on local support groups, just in case you're interested. Here you go. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, if you experience any new symptoms, like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. It was a pleasure meeting you, Avril. Take care, and I'll see you on August 16th.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will… see you then. And… thank you again for being so kind. Bye bye. .
