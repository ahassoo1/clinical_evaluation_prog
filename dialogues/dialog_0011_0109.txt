DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a new patient to the clinic. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, first time here. Hmm… what brings me? Oh! My head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not so bad at first, but getting worse. Like a… a tight band, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A tight band sensation at the back of your head that’s been worsening over the past three days. Thank you for clarifying. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically… hmm. It's not… sharp. Not like a poke. More like… pressure. Constant pressure. And when I move my head just so, it gets a little bit worse. Not a lot, but I notice it. It doesn’t go away completely when I lay down either. I try to rest, but… still there.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. Constant pressure, worsened with specific head movements, and not relieved by rest. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… no fever, I don’t think. No dizziness. I haven’t been sick to my stomach. My vision is okay. I can see fine. Oh! Wait… maybe a little tired. More tired than usual, but I’m ninety years old, Doctor. I get tired. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Brum. Fatigue at your age is certainly understandable. But it’s good to note. No fever, no dizziness, no nausea or vomiting, and vision is stable. Have you experienced any changes in your hearing or balance recently?
PATIENT: Hearing… no, not really. Old man hearing, you know? Always a little muffled. Balance… hmm. I haven’t fallen, if that’s what you mean. I use a cane sometimes, but that’s just… being careful. I don’t feel off balance, not exactly. Just… cautious.
DOCTOR: Thank you. No recent changes in hearing, and no reported instability or falls. You're being very thorough, Mr. Brum. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, I worked on the railroad for… almost my whole life. Dinkey operator, hostler, all sorts of things. Lots of lifting, lots of sun. My back aches sometimes, but that's just old age. I had a bad flu when I was a boy, almost didn’t make it. And… my wife, bless her soul, she passed away five years ago. Heart trouble. Other than that… I haven’t been to the doctor much. Didn't have much money for that, you see. No insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Brum. A history of physically demanding work, a serious childhood illness, and your wife’s heart condition. It’s good to know you haven’t had extensive medical care previously. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Never had any surgeries. Not even to take out my tonsils. My mother always said I was too tough for surgery. She was probably right. Always a bit of a fighter, I was. Still am, I guess. Just a little slower now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No prior surgeries. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be eighty-five, she was strong. She had… arthritis, I think. Bad in her hands. My father… he died young, when I was a boy. I don’t remember what he died of. Pneumonia, maybe? We didn’t talk about things like that much back then. My sister, she had… high blood pressure, I think. But that’s about all I remember. We weren’t a family that kept good records, you see. Mostly farmers and railroad workers. Not much sickness, just hard living.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. Arthritis in your mother, potential pneumonia in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you currently take, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Not really. I take a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when it gets really bad. Just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. And sometimes I take a little something to help me sleep, but not every night. Nothing else. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Makes me feel… cloudy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. Over-the-counter ibuprofen for arthritis, and occasional sleep aid. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. Never had a reaction to anything. Bees, maybe. Got stung a few times when I was a boy, but that just hurt. Didn’t make me sick. No, no allergies. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Simple needs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. No known allergies. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to briefly examine your head and neck, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know. And… tell me what you're doing as you go along. I like to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go along. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. I’m placing this cuff around your arm. It will tighten briefly, and I’ll listen with my stethoscope to get a reading. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not dramatically so. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll be using my stethoscope again, and I may ask you to take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds are normal. Your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Next, I'm going to briefly examine your head and neck. I'll be feeling for any tenderness or masses. Your head and neck feel normal. I don’t feel any tenderness or any unusual masses. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll test your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sounds alright. Just… don’t rush. I sometimes need a moment to… get my bearings. Old age, you know? But I’ll do my best to follow along. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. We'll take our time. Very good. Your eye movements are full and smooth. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your gait is slightly slow, but stable. You’re using your cane appropriately. Alright, Mr. Brum. That concludes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings from the examination, the headache is concerning, but not immediately alarming. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we’ll need to monitor. The fact that it’s been worsening over three days warrants further investigation to rule out any serious underlying cause. I think it would be best to order a CT scan of your head, just to be on the safe side, and some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any infection or inflammation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work? Hmm. Sounds… serious. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s best, then yes, let’s do it. I don’t want to ignore something important. But… will it be expensive? I don’t have much money, you see. And no insurance. Just tell me the truth, Doctor. I can handle it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Brum, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. You are right to ask about the cost. A CT scan can be expensive, and the blood work will add to that. I understand you have no insurance, which makes things more complicated. Let me explain the reasoning behind ordering these tests. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any structural abnormalities, such as a tumor, bleeding, or aneurysm. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any infection or inflammation that could be contributing to your headache. I’m going to be completely honest with you – these tests will likely cost several hundred dollars. However, our billing department has financial assistance programs available for patients who qualify. I will have them contact you directly to discuss your options and see if you are eligible for a discount or payment plan. I will also advocate for you to ensure you receive the most affordable care possible. In the meantime, I’ll write the orders for the CT scan and blood work. You can go to the imaging center and lab downstairs. They'll likely want to confirm your insurance status, but explain that you are uninsured, and they will work with our billing department. Would you like me to provide you with a written order and a list of the imaging center and lab contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written order and the contact information. That would be very helpful. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest with me. And for trying to help with the cost. It means a lot. I’ve always been a simple man, never needed much. But a headache like this… well, it worries me. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. Here are the orders for the CT scan and blood work. This list has the contact information for the imaging center and lab downstairs. They are aware we have a patient coming from our office. The imaging center is on the first floor, to the left of the reception desk. The lab is just around the corner. They both accept walk-ins, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead to confirm the wait times. While you’re waiting for the results, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed for the headache. If the pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I will have our billing department contact you within 24 hours to discuss your financial options. They are very helpful and will work with you to find a solution. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you again. For your time, your patience, and for… just being a good doctor. It’s rare to find someone who cares these days. I appreciate it. I’ll go get those tests done. And I’ll wait for the billing department to call. You have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Brum. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch soon. .
