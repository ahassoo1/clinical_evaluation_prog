DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Hmm, what brings me in… Let me think. It’s my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It’s a bother, really. Not terrible, just… uncomfortable. I don’t remember exactly when it started, honestly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings… that’s a good place to start. And you said it’s been going on for a while, without a specific onset?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A while. Not a sudden thing, no. More like… it just slowly got worse, I guess? I really don’t recall a specific day it started starting, if that makes sense. It’s hard for me to remember things these days. Mostly my hands and knees bother me, when they’re stiff. But sometimes my shoulders too.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It's common for these things to develop gradually. And don’t worry about remembering exact dates; we’ll piece it together. So, your hands, knees, and sometimes your shoulders are affected by this stiffness. When you say stiffness, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… what does it feel like? It’s… hard to explain. Like they’re not moving right, you know? Like rusty hinges, maybe? And it hurts a little to bend them at first. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It eases up after I’ve been moving around for a bit, but it’s always worse when I first wake up. It’s just… not nice. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. "Rusty hinges" is a very good way to describe it. And the dull ache that improves with movement is helpful information. Now, would you say this pain radiates anywhere, or is it localized to the joints themselves?
PATIENT: Radiates…? Oh, dear. Does that mean… does it spread? I don’t think so. It mostly stays in the joints. Maybe a little bit around them, but not down my arms or legs or anything. Just… where the joints are. I'm not really sure what 'radiates' means, if that helps. Sorry! I’m not good with… those words.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright! "Radiates" means spreading from the joint to other areas. So, it’s good to know it stays localized to the joints themselves. Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale… hmm. Let me think. At its worst… when I first get up, maybe a 4? Not terrible, like I said, but enough to notice. It doesn't last long, thankfully. It goes down to maybe a 2 or 3 after I’ve been up and moving for a little bit. It's not a constant pain, it comes and goes with the stiffness. Does that make sense? I don’t like pain much, of course, but it’s not… crippling or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lilliana. A 4 in the morning, decreasing to 2 or 3 with activity. So it sounds like the pain is closely linked to the stiffness. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in any of these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh, let me think… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes feel a little… puffy, maybe, but I just thought that was because of… well, I don’t know. Age, maybe? I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. Redness… no, I don’t think so. I would remember that, wouldn’t I? I don’t have very good eyesight these days either, so maybe I've missed it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can take a closer look. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll just gently check the range of motion and feel for any swelling or tenderness in your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. A quick look won’t hurt, will it? I trust you, Doctor. My joints… they're not very important. Well, they are important, but I can manage. Go ahead, do what you need to do. Just be gentle, please. They are a little sensitive this morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to gently move your hands like this... and then your wrists... Alright. I’m feeling some mild tenderness on the base of your index finger knuckles on both hands, and a very slight limitation in the range of motion of your wrists. No significant swelling that I can detect right now. Moving on to your elbows… and shoulders... No tenderness or swelling there. Now, let’s check your knees… There is some crepitus – that’s a grinding sensation – when I bend your knees, and mild tenderness along the joint line. No visible swelling. Overall, the range of motion is slightly limited but not dramatically so. It’s consistent with some mild joint wear and tear. Now, could you please flex and extend your ankles for me?
PATIENT: Oh, crepitus… is that bad? That sounds scary. I do hear popping noises sometimes when I bend my knees, but I thought that was just… old age again. Popping and grinding… it doesn’t hurt, really. Just… noises. Flex and extend… like this? Yes, that’s a little uncomfortable, actually. It’s not sharp, but… I can feel it. Mostly in the right ankle, I think. Old injury, maybe? I twisted it years ago, when I was… oh, I can’t remember now. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Lilliana. You're right, crepitus can be a bit concerning, but it's also very common, especially with age and some previous injury. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. And the discomfort in your right ankle is good information. Given your history of a previous injury, and the discomfort and limited range of motion we've found, along with the stiffness you experience, it sounds like you likely have some osteoarthritis affecting your joints. However, to rule out other possibilities, such as rheumatoid arthritis, I'd like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Osteo… arthritis? That sounds… awful. Is that what old people get? I thought my joints just… wore out. Blood work? Oh, dear. I don't like needles much, Doctor. But… if it will help, I suppose so. If you think it's important. Just… try to be quick, alright? And… don’t poke too hard! I bruise easily these days. What will the blood work tell you, anyway?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis is very common, especially as we get older. It essentially means the cartilage in your joints is wearing down, and it can cause pain and stiffness. It’s not a death sentence, and it's manageable. The blood work will help us rule out other types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune condition. It will also help us assess your overall inflammation levels. The test itself is very quick - a small sample of blood from your arm. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will try to be as gentle as possible. It will take only a few minutes. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, auto… immune? That sounds complicated. And I do bruise easily, you know. I bumped my arm yesterday and it's still purple. A small sample, you say? Well, alright. If it’s just a small sample. I suppose I can handle a little poke. But please, tell them to be gentle! And what will happen with the results? How long will it take? Will they call me? I don’t like waiting around… and I always forget things, so I'm afraid I'll forget to ask! Explain it slowly, alright? I'm a bit confused now.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll explain everything slowly. An autoimmune condition means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues, including your joints. We want to rule that out to make sure we have the correct diagnosis. The blood work involves a small sample - just a few vials of blood. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – will be very careful and gentle. I will make a note in your chart about your easy bruising. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. The office will call you to schedule that appointment. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of the results and our plan. In the meantime, we can start discussing some simple measures you can take to manage your symptoms, such as gentle exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and over-the-counter pain relief. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… better. A note about bruising, that’s good. And a written summary… yes, please! I always need things written down, or I forget. Gentle exercise… I do try to walk a little, but my knees bother me sometimes. And pain relief… I have some ibuprofen, but it doesn’t always help. So, 3-5 days for the results, and then a call to schedule an appointment? Alright. I think I understand now. What kind of exercise would be best? And… is there anything else I should be doing? I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard to do things when my joints are stiff and achy. Stopping to tie my shoes is a chore!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilliana. It's frustrating when simple things become difficult. For exercise, low-impact activities are best. Walking is great, but start slowly and listen to your body. Swimming or water aerobics are excellent, as the water supports your weight. Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises can also help maintain flexibility. I can give you a handout with some specific exercises. Besides exercise, maintaining a healthy weight can significantly reduce stress on your joints. Also, consider using heat or cold packs to relieve pain and stiffness. Heat can help loosen up your joints before exercise, while cold packs can reduce inflammation afterwards. I'm going to order the blood work now, and I'll also give you a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory medication, just in case the ibuprofen isn’t providing enough relief. We'll see what the results say, and then we can adjust the treatment plan accordingly. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, a handout would be lovely, thank you. And heat… yes, I do like a warm bath. That helps a little. Stronger medication… well, I don't like taking pills, but if it will help, I suppose so. Allergies…? Hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. I’ve taken ibuprofen before, with no problems. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a child, a long time ago. A rash, mostly. But I haven't taken it since. And… oh, I'm not sure. I have a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that's not an allergy, is it? I forget everything! I suppose it’s best to be safe. Just… no penicillin, alright? I definitely don’t want any rashes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no penicillin, noted. And a sensitive stomach – we'll keep that in mind when choosing the medication. We'll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I'm going to write a prescription for naproxen – it's similar to ibuprofen, but sometimes more effective. I’ll also print out that handout with the exercises and some general tips for managing osteoarthritis. And here's the lab order – you can take this to the lab, and they’ll draw the blood. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Naproxen… alright. I'll try it. And the exercises… yes, thank you. Room 203, you said? Down the hall. I can manage that. Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you being patient with me. I forget things so easily these days. Just… try not to give me too many pills, alright? I don't want to be taking a million things every day. I think… that’s all. Unless… oh, yes. Will this arthritis get worse? Is there anything I can do to stop it from getting worse? It's just… I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair, you know? It's a silly question, probably. But it's worrying me.
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Lilliana. It's a very valid concern. While we can’t stop osteoarthritis from progressing entirely, we can certainly slow it down and manage your symptoms effectively. Maintaining a healthy weight, staying active with low-impact exercises, and protecting your joints can all help. In some cases, physical therapy or joint injections may be beneficial. As for ending up in a wheelchair, that's unlikely with proper management. Most people with osteoarthritis continue to live active and fulfilling lives. We’ll monitor your condition closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. I’m glad you asked. It’s important to address your concerns. I will schedule a follow up appointment with you for 2 weeks after the lab results. Do you need help with directions to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… reassuring. Monitoring and adjusting… yes, that sounds good. Two weeks… alright. I can remember that. No, I think I can manage the directions. It's just down the hall, you said? I have a pretty good sense of direction, when I'm not confused. Thank you. Really, thank you very much, Doctor. You've been very kind. I feel a little bit better now, knowing I'm not going to end up in a wheelchair. I think… I think that’s everything. I won’t take up any more of your time. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
