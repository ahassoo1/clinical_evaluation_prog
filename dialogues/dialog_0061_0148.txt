DOCTOR: Talofa, Noelani. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. It’s… pain. Down there. With… the, you know… the male parts. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and… I wasn’t sure who to see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you came in. It’s never embarrassing to talk about your health, and you’re right to ask someone. We can definitely figure out what’s going on. When you say “down there,” and with the male parts, are you referring to pain in the scrotum, testicles, or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Scrotum… testicles… Yes, those words sound right. It feels… mostly in the testicles, I think. Though, sometimes it radiates… up a bit. It's hard to explain precisely. It's not… constant pain, you understand? More like… twinges. And a dull ache. Is that making any sense? I apologize, I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Noelani. Twinges and a dull ache, radiating upwards... that’s helpful. And no need to apologize at all; describing pain is always tricky. Okay, so it's primarily in the testicles, and sometimes you feel it moving upwards. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… a difficult question. A while, certainly. Perhaps… a few weeks? It started gradually, I think. It wasn't sudden. I mostly ignored it at first, hoping it would just… go away on its own. I am terrible with dates, I apologize. It’s… been a stressful time, recently. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Stress can absolutely be relevant, Noelani. It affects everything! A few weeks of gradually increasing pain is helpful to know. Okay, and when you say “increasing,” has it gotten significantly worse over those few weeks, stayed about the same, or is it more fluctuating – some days better, some days worse?
PATIENT: Fluctuating, I believe. Yes, that’s a better word. Some days it's barely noticeable, just a little discomfort. Other days… well, other days it’s quite unpleasant. It's worse after I’ve been… active, I think. Like after working in the workshop. Though it isn't always after working. It’s rather unpredictable, really. I am sorry for being so vague. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. You’re doing great, and unpredictable symptoms are very common. It's helpful to know it's worse with activity. Okay, so fluctuating pain, worse with activity… Have you noticed any swelling or redness in the scrotum, or any changes in the size or shape of your testicles?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. That’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. No, I haven’t noticed any redness. Perhaps… a little bit of… puffiness sometimes? But I’m not sure if that’s just normal. I haven’t really… examined them closely, if that makes sense. And no, no changes in size or shape, as far as I can tell. It’s probably silly of me to not notice those things.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Noelani. Many people don't regularly examine themselves, and it's perfectly okay. Puffiness is good to note. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the pain, such as a fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: No… no fever, chills, or nausea. Vomiting, no. Urination… no changes that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… normal there. Although, now that you mention it… I have been a little more tired lately. But I attributed that to… well, everything. I have been sleeping poorly. Perhaps that's the reason. It’s probably just old age, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not old age, Noelani! Fatigue can be caused by many things, and it’s good to note. Alright, so no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or changes in urination, just some fatigue. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… another difficult thing to remember. Let me think… I believe I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. But it was controlled with medication. I stopped taking the medication a long time ago, and haven't been to a doctor regularly. Medicare is… helpful, but it’s difficult to get appointments sometimes. And… I don’t think I have anything else. No diabetes, no… other serious illnesses, as far as I know. I am truly sorry for my poor memory. It’s getting worse, I fear.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. We can look up some of that in your records, and Medicare can be challenging to navigate. So, history of high blood pressure controlled with medication in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. No surgeries. Hospitalized… Once, a long time ago, when I was very young. For… appendicitis, I think. But that was many, many years ago. And nothing since. It was… a very simple surgery, I believe. Nothing complicated. I truly don’t remember much about it. Is that… relevant? I am beginning to feel rather foolish, Doctor. I am making such a poor patient.
DOCTOR: You’re not a poor patient at all, Noelani. It’s perfectly normal not to remember details from long ago. Appendectomy as a child, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like cancer, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear… That’s… complicated. My family… we didn’t really talk about these things. Not much. My mother… she had… heart problems, I think. But she didn’t go to the doctor either. And my father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t really know what he died from. It was… a long time ago. And I don’t have any siblings, so I don’t have anyone to ask. I am truly sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… I don’t have much information. It’s all very… vague.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Noelani. It’s very common for families not to discuss these things. So, mother with heart problems, father’s cause of death unknown. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No. Not currently. I stopped taking the blood pressure medication, as I mentioned. And I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat healthy, but… it’s difficult. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. Just… natural remedies, if anything. Although, I haven’t been using any recently. Perhaps some chamomile tea for sleep, but that’s hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea doesn’t count, Noelani. Alright, no current medications. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. I’ve never had a problem with pollen or dust or… anything. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Unless… Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy after I’ve been working with certain types of wood. But I don't know if that’s an allergy. It might just be the wood dust. It's not serious, Doctor. I just wear gloves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible mild skin irritation with certain woods, but no known significant allergies. Alright, Noelani, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to examine your abdomen and, most importantly, your scrotum to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s… fine. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I understand. A physical exam… yes. Just… please be gentle. It’s… a bit sensitive. I am… a little nervous. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Do I need to… undress?
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. You're right to be nervous, and I appreciate you letting me know. For the exam, could you please remove your pants and underwear?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Of course. Please… let me know if I need to do anything else. I feel rather foolish. Is there a drape I could… use?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. Here’s a drape. Feel free to use it to cover yourself as much as you’re comfortable with. Take your time. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you’re uncomfortable at any point.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No tenderness to palpation noted. Okay. Now, I'm going to examine your scrotum. I’ll need to gently feel your testicles and surrounding areas. This may be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. Please tell me if you feel any sharp pain. Left testicle feels normal in size and consistency. Right testicle… … feels slightly enlarged and firm. There’s a small, hard lump on the upper pole. No tenderness noted directly on the lump, but there is some mild discomfort with manipulation. Skin is normal in appearance, no redness or swelling. Okay, I'm finished with the exam now.
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, that’s… uncomfortable. But not terribly painful. Just… a bit odd. A lump… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I am… rather frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Noelani. Finding a lump is always concerning, and you're right to be worried. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's serious, but it does require further investigation to determine what it is. Based on my exam, the most likely possibilities are a hydrocele – a fluid collection around the testicle – or a testicular torsion. Less commonly, it could be a varicocele, an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, or, in rarer cases, a tumor. However, I need to order some tests to be certain. I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound, which is a painless imaging test that will allow us to visualize the testicles and surrounding structures. I also want to order a urine test and a blood test to rule out any infection or other underlying causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A tumor…? Oh dear. Hydrocele… that sounds better. But a tumor… is that… cancerous? And what about this torsion? Is that… dangerous? I don't understand all of these medical terms. It’s… very overwhelming. What does all of this mean? Will I need surgery? Will I be… alright?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re overwhelmed, Noelani. And it's good to ask all of these questions. Let's break it down. A hydrocele is a fluid collection – it's usually harmless and often goes away on its own or can be easily drained. A varicocele is a bit like a varicose vein – it's also generally not serious, although it can sometimes cause discomfort. Now, a testicular torsion is a twisting of the blood supply to the testicle, and that is a medical emergency. It requires immediate surgery to restore blood flow, or the testicle could be damaged. However, based on your symptoms and my exam, a torsion is less likely, as you don't have the severe, sudden pain typically associated with it. As for a tumor, the word is scary, but not all tumors are cancerous. Many are benign, meaning they are not harmful and won't spread. The ultrasound will help us determine if there's a tumor present, and if so, what type it is. The blood and urine tests are just to rule out any infection that might be causing the lump or discomfort. The ultrasound is the most important test right now. It will give us the clearest picture of what's going on. We're going to take things one step at a time. First, let's get the ultrasound scheduled. If it shows something concerning, we'll discuss the next steps, which might include further imaging or a referral to a urologist – a specialist in the male reproductive system. We will make a plan to make sure you are okay. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes a little more sense. One step at a time. That’s… reassuring. A urologist…? Is that… a serious doctor? Will I need to see them right away? And the ultrasound… how long will that take to schedule? And will I have to… undress again for that? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I am just… very anxious. This is all so frightening.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Noelani. Questions are good – it means you're engaged in your care. A urologist is a specialist – they’re experts in the male reproductive system. We will likely only need to see one if the ultrasound shows something that needs further investigation. As for scheduling the ultrasound, I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, schedule it for you right away. She’ll find the closest facility with the quickest availability. It usually takes just 20-30 minutes, and yes, you will need to undress from the waist down again for the ultrasound, as the technician needs to be able to see the testicles clearly. But it’s a painless procedure. We are going to take care of this, one step at a time. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Let me call Sarah now to get this scheduled for you. While she's doing that, do you have any concerns about getting home safely?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Getting home safely… no, I live close by. I can walk. But… perhaps I should ask a neighbor to come with me, just in case? That would be… reassuring. But I don’t want to bother them. It's alright. I’ll be fine. I think. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. You have been very kind and patient with me. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. It's my job. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you do decide you’d like a neighbor to accompany you. It’s always better to be safe, and there’s no bother involved. Let me call Sarah now and get the ultrasound scheduled, and then we can discuss some things you can do at home in the meantime. While we wait, is there anything else on your mind?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you again. Just… please call Sarah, and let me know when I need to go for the ultrasound. I am… trying to remain calm. It’s just… hard. I truly appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. And you’re doing a good job, honestly. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious in this situation. I’ll call Sarah now. Okay, Sarah has scheduled you for an ultrasound at Coastal Imaging tomorrow at 10:00 AM. They are located at 123 Ocean Drive, just a few blocks from here. You’ll need to arrive 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. They do ask that you bring your insurance card and a photo ID. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity and wear supportive underwear. If you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, or any new symptoms, please call my office immediately. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound appointment?
PATIENT: 10:00 AM tomorrow… 123 Ocean Drive. Insurance card… photo ID. Okay. I think I can remember that. Supportive underwear… yes, I can do that. And… call if there’s severe pain. I believe I wrote all of that down. Yes, here it is. I don't think I have any other questions right now, Doctor. Just… thank you. For everything. You have been very kind. I truly appreciate your patience and understanding. I will try to remain calm and follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. And you will, I have no doubt. Just remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to support you. Here’s a written summary of everything we discussed, including the appointment information and instructions. I’ll see you back in the office if anything changes, or after the ultrasound, to discuss the results. And please, don’t worry too much. We’ll take care of this together. Have a good day, Noelani. And please, be kind to yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will try to remain calm. And be kind to myself. Thank you again for everything. You have been very kind. I… I think I will go now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You too, Noelani. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
