DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part, mostly. It’s been hurting quite a bit lately. Not constantly, but… episodes, you said? Yes, that sounds right. I don't recall the specifics very well, but it's… unpleasant. I do know it’s connected to… something the other doctors mentioned a while back. Lupus, was it? It feels similar to times when that's been… active, I think.
DOCTOR: Lupus, right. Okay. So, episodes of abdominal pain… and you’re thinking it might be a flare-up?
PATIENT: Yes, a flare-up. That sounds… right. I’ve had it for… a long time, haven’t I? It comes and goes. It’s just… these recent times have been more… noticeable, I believe. And rather… worrisome. I do apologize for being so vague. It's difficult to recall everything precisely.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly alright. Lupus can cause a lot of different symptoms, and memory issues can be part of it sometimes too, so I understand. “Noticeable” how?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s… kind of you to say. It’s just… the pain is stronger, I think. And it lasts longer. Usually, it’s a sharp ache, but this time it’s more of a… a cramping feeling. And… it comes on more suddenly. It’s hard to explain. I've also been… rather tired, though I’m always a bit tired, to be honest. Perhaps that’s unrelated.
DOCTOR: Stronger pain, cramping, sudden onset… Okay. And you said fatigue. Has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Yes. My appetite hasn’t been very good. I haven’t been eating as much as usual. Everything just feels… less appealing. And… I seem to be going to the restroom more often. Not… anything dramatic, just… more frequent. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Appetite loss, increased restroom visits… yes, those are important things to know. Any changes in your bowel movements themselves?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, isn't it? I… I suppose they're a bit looser than usual. Not terribly so, but… not quite right. I apologize again for not being more… specific. It’s just… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Ms. Glymph. These things are difficult to talk about, and it’s important for me to get a clear picture. Okay, looser stools… Has there been any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no blood. Definitely not. I would remember that, I think. Just… softer. And more frequent. It's just… unsettling. I haven't had any fever, if you were wondering. And no nausea, thankfully. Just… a general feeling of being unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no nausea, no blood. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then feel it gently to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I do hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening now… Everything sounds fairly normal. Ooh, that’s a bit tender here, on your lower left side. And here… a little bit on the right. Not terribly painful, but definitely some sensitivity. Are you feeling any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. On the left side, yes. It's… a dull ache, rather. Not sharp, but… noticeable. And a bit on the right, too, as you said. It's… just like the pain I’ve been experiencing, really. It's not unbearable, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in both lower quadrants. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to rule things out. Heart sounds good, lungs are clear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, to my recollection. I take a mild blood pressure medication, but that's all. And… occasional pain relievers, of course. But no specific allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're on a blood pressure medication… Do you know the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I have it at home, of course, but I can’t recall the name at the moment. It’s… a small white pill, I believe. I've been taking it for… several years now. Perhaps my pharmacy has a record?
DOCTOR: Let me check here… Ah, yes. Lisinopril. 10 milligrams daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Lisinopril, that's it. You are a lifesaver, Doctor. My memory is just… not what it used to be. Thank you for finding that out.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly alright. Okay, so Lisinopril 10mg daily. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a lupus flare-up affecting your gastrointestinal system. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, inflammatory markers, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also want to order a stool sample to check for any infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood work and a stool sample, yes. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. I just want to feel better. And to know what's causing this, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall. Once you’ve completed those, just let the front desk know, and we’ll get them sent over. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the pain and discomfort. And I want you to drink plenty of fluids and eat a bland diet. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Bland diet, fluids, and the medication. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding? I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Avoid any foods that seem to aggravate your stomach. Spicy foods, fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol… things like that. If you notice any blood in your stool, or a high fever, or severe abdominal pain, please call the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll see how the blood work looks, and we can discuss further treatment options when the results come back. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And patient with my… forgetfulness. I just need to remember to get these tests done. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. Don’t worry about the forgetfulness, it’s perfectly alright. Just take your time, and if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to call. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
