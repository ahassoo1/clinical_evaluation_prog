DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, dear. What does bring me in? It’s this… unsteadiness. I feel quite off-balance, you see. It's been happening for… well, I can’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Just recently, I believe. It makes things rather difficult at work, naturally.
DOCTOR: I see. Unsteadiness, and you're having trouble pinpointing when it began, but it’s relatively recent. And it’s impacting your work. That’s good information to start with. To help me understand better, can you describe what you mean by “off-balance”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a fall, not yet, thankfully. It's more like… when I walk, I feel like I might wobble. Or, like the floor isn’t quite… steady under my feet. Sometimes it’s worse than others. And occasionally, things seem to spin, just for a moment. It's unsettling, to say the least. I hope that makes some sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Wobbliness and occasional brief spinning sensations. We call that vertigo, but we need to determine the cause. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Oh, dear… I’m not certain. Nothing obvious, no. I work with… well, rotary drills, in the oil and gas fields. It’s a fairly physical job, quite a bit of movement. Perhaps that’s it? Though I’ve been doing it for some time, and haven’t had this issue before. I do recall feeling… a bit lightheaded on a particularly warm day last week, but that’s all I can pinpoint. It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Snerling. You work a physically demanding job with a lot of movement, and you noted some lightheadedness with the heat. We’ll keep all of that in mind. Now, let’s talk a bit more about these episodes. When you feel this unsteadiness or spinning, do you experience any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Sometimes, a bit of nausea, I suppose. Not vomiting, thankfully, just a queasy feeling. And… I think my hearing feels a bit muffled during those times. It's very subtle, difficult to say for certain. And… oh, this is rather embarrassing… I seem to have trouble concentrating when it’s happening. Everything feels… distant. I truly hope I'm not being too vague, Doctor. It’s hard to recall precisely what happens during those moments.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Snerling. Nausea, muffled hearing, and difficulty concentrating – those are all important details. Let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any history of ear infections, or any other ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ear problems… Let me think… As a child, I had… something, I believe. A doctor gave me some drops. But it was a very long time ago. I don't recall having any issues since then, honestly. I’ve always considered my hearing to be quite good, all things considered. I've never worn hearing aids, if that’s what you're asking. It’s all a bit… distant, I’m afraid. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Snerling. A childhood ear infection is good to know. Now, have you ever had a head injury or concussion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A head injury… Let me see. Well, there was that incident… a few years ago, now. A piece of equipment shifted while I was working. It didn’t directly hit my head, but I definitely bumped it against something. It wasn’t… severe, I don’t believe. I was checked out by the medic on site, and they said I was fine. Just a bit of a bruise. I don’t recall experiencing any lasting effects. But that's the only thing I can think of. Is that helpful, Doctor? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A bump to the head a few years ago, checked out by a medic and no lasting effects noted. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic conditions… Let me think carefully. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but that was… before. I don't believe I've ever been diagnosed with anything myself. I've always been quite healthy, all things considered. I have regular check-ups with my general practitioner, and they’ve never mentioned anything of concern. I take a daily vitamin, that's all. Is that alright, Doctor? I truly hope I'm not being too vague. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Snerling. No chronic medical conditions and just a daily vitamin - that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… No, not currently. Just the daily vitamin, as I mentioned. Occasionally, I take something for… headaches. But it's just over-the-counter, ibuprofen, I believe. Nothing regular, only when needed. And… oh, sometimes a bit of something for indigestion, but again, only when necessary. Nothing prescribed, Doctor. I try to avoid medications whenever possible, you see. Is that alright? My memory is… unreliable, as you’ve probably noticed. It’s quite frustrating, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Snerling. Occasional ibuprofen and something for indigestion, no regular prescription medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had any severe reactions to anything. Sometimes, a bit of a sniffle with certain pollens, but nothing serious. No food allergies, no reactions to medications, as far as I can recall. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. Is that alright, Doctor? I hope I’m not being too vague, you see. My memory, as you’ve probably noticed, is… unreliable. It's rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Snerling. No known allergies. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Do any of your immediate family members – parents, siblings, or children – have a history of dizziness, hearing loss, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her balance in her later years, I believe. She attributed it to… old age, mostly. And my brother… he has some trouble with his eyesight, but nothing neurological, as far as I know. My father was quite healthy, all things considered. And I… well, I didn’t have any children. It's all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. It's difficult to recall specifics. Is that alright, Doctor? My memory isn’t what it once was, you see. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Snerling. Mother with balance issues in later years is good to know. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My lifestyle… Well, I work, mostly. As a rotary drill operator, in the oil and gas fields. It’s quite physical, as you know. Long hours, often outdoors. I don’t… socialize much. Not since… well, since my husband passed. I try to eat a healthy diet, when I can. Mostly fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to stay active, but it's difficult with the long hours and the demanding work. Is that helpful, Doctor? I hope I'm not being too vague. My memory is… unreliable, as you've probably noticed. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Snerling. Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like a physically demanding job with a good overall lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your balance and hearing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam? Yes, certainly. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Please, do whatever you need to do. I’ll try to cooperate as best as I can. Though I must warn you, I may be a bit… unsteady. It’s the reason I’m here, you see. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly fine that you’re unsteady. That’s what we’re trying to figure out. I'll need you to stand up when you're ready. First, I'll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll perform a Romberg test, which involves standing with your feet together and your eyes closed to assess your balance. After that, I’ll check your ears with an otoscope. Finally, I will do a few basic neurological tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… thorough. Yes, certainly. Please, do whatever you need to do. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… the Romberg test… and checking my ears… and neurological tests… Yes, that sounds alright. Please, just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I’ll try my best to cooperate. Though I must warn you, I may be a bit… unsteady. It’s the reason I’m here, you see. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you’ve probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Perhaps if I hold onto something?
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea. We can certainly hold onto the chair for support during the Romberg test. And I'll be right here to steady you. Alright, Ms. Snerling, your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, if you’d be comfortable, please stand with your feet together. I’ll ask you to close your eyes when I tell you. Do you feel steady enough to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Normal limits… that’s reassuring. Yes, I believe I can manage that. Standing with my feet together… and closing my eyes… Yes, I can do that. Though I may be a bit… unsteady. It’s the reason I’m here, you see. Please, let me know if I start to wobble. Perhaps if I hold onto the chair lightly? I truly hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know when you want me to close my eyes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Please hold onto the chair lightly. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes. Okay, Ms. Snerling, you can open your eyes now. You did very well. You exhibited some mild swaying during the Romberg test, which is consistent with a balance issue. Now, I’m going to examine your ears with an otoscope. This will help me look for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Mild swaying… that doesn’t sound terribly alarming, does it? I’m glad I didn't fall! Yes, certainly. Please, examine my ears if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’ll try to remain still. Though I may flinch a bit, if it’s uncomfortable. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling. Your ear canals are clear, and I don't see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. Your tympanic membranes appear intact, though there's a slight dullness to the right tympanic membrane. That could indicate some fluid behind the eardrum. Now, I’ll just perform a few basic neurological tests to assess your coordination and reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Clear ear canals… that’s reassuring. A slight dullness to the right tympanic membrane… Is that something to be concerned about, Doctor? Fluid behind the eardrum… That doesn’t sound terribly alarming, does it? Yes, certainly. Please, perform the neurological tests if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’ll try to cooperate as best as I can. Though I may be a bit… unsteady. It’s the reason I’m here, you see. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: It’s good that your ear canals are clear. The slight dullness to the right tympanic membrane is something we'll keep in mind, but it’s not necessarily cause for immediate concern. It could be a number of things. Now, for the neurological tests, I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes and coordination. First, can you follow my finger as I move it in an “H” pattern?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not necessarily cause for immediate concern… that’s reassuring. I appreciate you explaining that, Doctor. Yes, certainly. I’ll try to follow your finger as you move it in an “H” pattern. Though I may be a bit… unsteady. It’s the reason I’m here, you see. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know if I need to stop.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated, which is good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’ll lightly tap your knees with a small hammer. This is perfectly normal, and it shouldn’t be painful. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smooth and coordinated eye movements… that’s reassuring. I’m glad to hear that. Yes, certainly. Please, check my reflexes if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Lightly tapping my knees with a small hammer… That shouldn’t be painful, you say? I hope not! Though I may flinch a bit, if it’s uncomfortable. Is there anything I should be prepared for? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know if I need to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling, your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild case of vestibular neuritis, which is an inflammation of the inner ear that can cause balance issues and dizziness. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Normal reflexes… that’s reassuring. Vestibular neuritis… inflammation of the inner ear… Is that a serious condition, Doctor? Balance issues and dizziness… That’s what brought me here, you see. Blood tests… To check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying conditions… Yes, certainly. Please, order the blood tests if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Snerling. It’s good you’re asking questions. Vestibular neuritis is usually not serious, but it can be quite debilitating. The good news is that it often resolves on its own with time and treatment. The blood tests will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. I’ll order a complete blood count, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid panel. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Resolves on its own with time and treatment… That’s reassuring. Complete blood count, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a thyroid panel… That sounds… thorough. Latex allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any problems with latex before, as far as I can recall. Though… my memory is… unreliable, as you’ve probably noticed. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. Just let me know what I need to do. I hope I’m not being too difficult. Is there anything else I should be prepared for?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No latex allergy is helpful. The phlebotomist will give you some instructions before drawing your blood. It will only take a few minutes. I'll also prescribe a medication called meclizine to help alleviate the dizziness and nausea. It's an over-the-counter medication, but I’ll write you a prescription just in case your insurance requires it. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Meclizine… to help alleviate the dizziness and nausea… That sounds… sensible. Is it safe to take with a daily vitamin, Doctor? I take a multi-vitamin every morning. And is there anything I should be aware of, any side effects? I hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you've probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. Is it safe to drive after taking it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Snerling. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Meclizine is generally safe to take with a multi-vitamin, but it can cause drowsiness as a side effect. Therefore, it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you’re taking it, especially when you first start taking it. The drowsiness usually subsides after a few days. Common side effects also include dry mouth and blurred vision. I will write you a prescription for 12.5 mg to be taken once a day as needed for the dizziness and nausea. If the symptoms persist or worsen despite the medication, please let me know. Would you like me to write you a note for work, explaining that you may experience some drowsiness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Drowsiness… That’s… concerning. I do drive to work, you see. Perhaps I should take a few days off? And dry mouth and blurred vision… That doesn’t sound terribly pleasant. A note for work… Yes, please. That would be most helpful. Perhaps explaining that I may be experiencing some side effects from medication. I truly hope I’m not being too difficult. My memory, as you’ve probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. I just want to make sure I can continue working safely. What if the symptoms don't subside, Doctor? What then?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Snerling. It's wise to take a few days off if you're concerned about driving. And that's perfectly alright to ask about what if the symptoms don’t subside. If the symptoms don't improve after a week of taking the meclizine, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further evaluation. This could include a referral to an ENT specialist or a neurologist. We would also consider an MRI of your brain to rule out any other underlying causes. I’ll give you a follow-up appointment for one week to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An ENT specialist… and a neurologist… and an MRI… That sounds… concerning. But I appreciate you explaining the possibilities, Doctor. I truly do. A follow-up appointment for one week… That’s good. That will give me time to see if the medication helps. No, I believe that’s all my questions for today. You’ve been most helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I hope I haven’t been too difficult. My memory, as you’ve probably noticed, is… unreliable. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. I truly appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You haven't been difficult at all, Ms. Snerling. It's my job to answer your questions and address your concerns. And please, don't worry about your memory. We'll take things one step at a time. Here are your prescriptions and the note for work. The lab technician will be with you shortly to draw your blood. I wish you a speedy recovery. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us. Have a good day, Ms. Snerling.
