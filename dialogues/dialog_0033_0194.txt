DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. MayHugh, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Terasa MayHugh. Though… honestly, I forget how many people call me that these days. It’s… been a bit of a blur, you see. I just hope we can get this sorted quickly, if that’s alright. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, let’s try to be efficient then. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They… go quiet sometimes. And then everything spins. It’s a horrible feeling, like… being on a boat, but I haven't been on a boat in years. It just… happens. And my daughter, bless her heart, she’s worried sick. She said something about it running in the family… my husband had trouble with it too, I think. It’s… all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Fuzzy is… unhelpful, Mrs. MayHugh. But alright. So, intermittent hearing loss and… dizziness. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did it start… That’s a good question. I… honestly don’t know exactly. It comes and goes, you see? It's been happening… for a while now, I suppose. Maybe a few months? Longer? I really couldn’t say. It’s… hard to remember when it started when it’s always sort of been there, on and off. Is that… a useful answer? I’m sorry. I just… don't have a good memory for dates.
DOCTOR: “Vague onset – months.” Alright. And is this dizziness constant, or does it come in spells?
PATIENT: Spells, definitely spells. Not all the time, thank goodness. It comes on… suddenly. Like a wave, almost. Everything just starts spinning and I have to sit down. It doesn't last long, usually. Maybe a few minutes? It's just… very unpleasant while it's happening. Makes me feel quite sick, too. Not actually sick, just… the feeling of it. Is that clear? I’m trying to explain it as best I can.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, spell-like dizziness with a sensation of nausea. Any ringing in your ears associated with this?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. But not always. It comes and goes like everything else, doesn't it? It’s hard to tell if it’s with the dizziness or just happens at other times. I suppose I mostly notice it when things are quiet. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes, that ringing. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes. Any history of head trauma, ear infections, or recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Head trauma… no, not that I recall. I’ve always been a bit clumsy, but nothing serious. Ear infections… when I was a child, perhaps? A long time ago. It was so long ago, I barely remember. Recent illnesses… I had a little cold a few months back, but nothing major. Just a sniffle and a cough. Nothing that would explain all this, surely? It’s probably just old age catching up, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your ears. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Just… try to be quick, would you? My back isn’t what it used to be, and I have a… an appointment later. Not a very important one, but still. And please tell me if you see anything… worrying. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Both ear canals are clear. Tympanic membranes appear normal, though slightly… dull. Listening to your heart and lungs… heart rate is regular, a little fast, perhaps. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No murmurs or wheezes noted. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes, I can. Is everything alright? It feels a bit strange, having someone looking at everything so closely. I don’t think I’m very good at this… following things. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, either. Just… go slowly, please. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: There's a slight nystagmus present in both eyes, particularly when looking to the right. Alright. Given your symptoms – the intermittent hearing loss, dizziness, ringing, and now this nystagmus… it's suggestive of a vestibular issue. Likely Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. We'll need to confirm with some further testing. I’m ordering an electronystagmography, or ENG, and possibly a hearing test.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Electron-what-now? And a hearing test… I had one of those years ago. Is it… serious? All these fancy words are making my head spin. And is this… will it take long? I really don’t have much time, you see. I just… I wish someone could just fix it, quickly. It’s all very overwhelming. Is this going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: The tests are to determine the cause, Mrs. MayHugh. They’re relatively quick, outpatient procedures. As for cost… Medicare should cover a significant portion, but I cannot provide specific financial details. Let’s focus on getting the information we need. I will write you a referral for both tests. The ENG will assess your inner ear function, and the hearing test will rule out any hearing loss contributing to your symptoms. The receptionist can help you schedule the appointments. I recommend getting these done as soon as possible. And please, try to stay hydrated. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… well. Right. Hydrated. Yes, I can try to do that. And… schedule. I suppose I should. It's all a bit much, isn’t it? Will I… will I need someone to drive me? Is it dangerous to go alone? I don’t want to… fall. I get so dizzy. And… will it hurt? No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. Thank you, Doctor. I think I'll just… go and ask the receptionist, then. It’s been… a lot.
DOCTOR: The tests are generally well-tolerated, Mrs. MayHugh. However, given your dizziness, I advise having someone drive you, yes. And please, avoid any strenuous activity until after the tests. I will see you after the results are in. .
