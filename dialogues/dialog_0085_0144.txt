DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s… nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly? I just… well, I was in the area, visiting my niece, and she said I should just pop in and see if everything was still… ticking. You know. Just checking. It’s been a while since I’ve been to a doctor, and she worries. A lot. Though, frankly, I feel perfectly fine. Mostly. What year is it again? It feels like things are just… blurring together these days.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to want a check-up, even if you’re feeling well, Ms. Calvery. And it's good of your niece to encourage you to take care of your health. Today is August 2nd, 2025. It is easy for time to slip away. So, “ticking” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: August? Oh my. Time really is going. Well, “ticking” just means… you know. Making sure everything’s still working. The heart, the… the bits and bobs. I used to work in surgery, you see. For… oh, goodness, decades. So I know what can go wrong. It's just… sometimes I forget what’s going right these days. My memory isn’t what it used to be, that’s for sure. It’s probably nothing, honestly. Just an old woman being… particular.
DOCTOR: It’s very common for things to change as we get older, Ms. Calvery, and it’s good you’re aware of that. It’s also understandable, given your background in surgery, that you’re attuned to how things are working! To get a better picture of everything, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history. Right. Well, I suppose. It was a long time ago, you know. And I was always so busy… running around with instruments and such. Let’s see… I was married, a long, long time ago. My husband… he passed, goodness, ten years ago now? More? It's all a blur. I had no children, if that’s what you’re wondering. A career woman, that’s what they called me. Surgical Tech, mostly. Though I did a bit of everything. What exactly are you trying to find out? This is all a bit… tedious, if you don’t mind my saying.
DOCTOR: Not at all tedious, Ms. Calvery. We just want to get a full picture, and you’re right, it’s okay if things aren’t crystal clear. Knowing about your past helps me understand what’s going on now. We'll take it at your pace. You mentioned your husband. I'm sorry for your loss. And it’s perfectly fine that you didn’t have children. We'll skip that part if you're uncomfortable. Let’s start with illnesses or conditions you’ve had in the past. Anything major – even things that seemed small at the time?
PATIENT: Oh, well… there was that time I had the flu. Dreadful. Kept me in bed for a week. And… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young, I suppose. That was… unpleasant. But other than that… honestly, I was always very healthy. Knock on wood. I was always too busy to get sick, if you know what I mean. Running around, assisting the doctors… always on my feet. I did have a bit of trouble with my back for a while, after all those years of bending and lifting. But I just… toughed it out. We didn’t have time for aches and pains in those days. It was a different world.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you were quite active! Back pain is common with physical work, and it’s good you managed through it. Do you still experience back pain currently?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Not terribly. It’s just… a stiffness, you know? Especially in the mornings. And if I bend over too quickly. But it’s nothing that a little bit of stretching doesn’t fix. Honestly, it’s more of a reminder that I’m old than actual pain. It's a nuisance, really. And it does make getting dressed a bit… precarious. But I manage. I still live on my own, you see. I’m perfectly capable. Though my niece keeps offering to… "help." Which usually means rearranging everything and telling me what I should be doing. Honestly, it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful that you’re still living independently, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you’re very resourceful! And it's understandable that you want to maintain your own routines. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… besides the appendix… oh! Yes! I had my gallbladder out. That was… a long time ago. After the appendix, it was the gallbladder, I think. It was… routine, they said. I was in and out of the hospital in a few days. Nothing dramatic. Though I did feel rather… sick afterwards, for a while. It wasn't the surgery itself, but the recovery. I just wasn't very good at resting. Always trying to get back to work too quickly. That was my downfall, I suppose. Always pushing myself. What year is it again?
DOCTOR: It's August 2nd, 2025, Ms. Calvery. And it sounds like you’ve been very dedicated throughout your life. It’s admirable, but also important to allow yourself time to rest and recover when needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. I don't think so. I've never really had any trouble with anything. Maybe a little bit of a runny nose when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? I took some penicillin as a child, I think, but I don’t recall having any reaction. It was… a long time ago. I can’t really remember much about it. My niece always asks me about medications, too. She’s terribly worried about me taking something I shouldn’t. Honestly, she treats me like I'm… fragile. Which I am not. I was a surgical technician for decades! I know what medications do.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you have a good understanding of medications. And it’s perfectly reasonable for your niece to be concerned about your well-being. Are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it flares up. It’s just… ibuprofen, I think. Over-the-counter. Nothing fancy. And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I ran out a while ago and haven't gotten around to replacing it. My niece keeps telling me I should, but honestly, I forget. And I took something for my blood pressure for a while, years ago. But the doctor said it was fine to stop, so I did. It’s all a bit… blurry, if you don’t mind me saying. So many doctors over the years.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you’ve been managing your health well. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. That’s… complicated. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my father… he was a strong, silent type. Never really talked about his health. I don’t recall anyone else having any… significant illnesses, really. My brother passed away a few years ago, but he was… not very forthcoming about things. A bit of a loner, if you know what I mean. Honestly, we weren’t a very close family. It’s probably best not to dwell on it. What year is it again?
DOCTOR: It’s August 2nd, 2025, Ms. Calvery. And that’s perfectly alright if the family history is unclear. We can work with what we have. Finally, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that even mean? I mean, I live alone, as I said. My husband passed away, and I don’t have any children. I used to have a few friends from work, but we’ve all… drifted apart over the years. I enjoy reading, mostly. And watching television. I don’t really… go out much anymore. Too much trouble. My niece takes me to the grocery store sometimes, and we have tea. That’s about it, really. A quiet life. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. A quiet life can be very peaceful. And it's good that you have your niece to spend time with. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask you a few more general questions about how you've been feeling lately. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it comes and goes, I suppose. I don't really try to eat much, if you know what I mean? Just enough to keep going. And I've probably lost a little weight over the years. My clothes are a bit looser than they used to be, but honestly, I don’t weigh myself very often. It’s not something I dwell on. Everything’s a bit… droopy these days, if you ask me. Not just my appetite, but… everything. It’s just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Calvery. It's common for appetite and weight to change as we age. Have you been experiencing any difficulty with sleep – trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. That’s… a mixed bag. I fall asleep easily enough, usually. It’s staying asleep that’s the problem. I wake up a lot during the night. Thinking about things. Or nothing at all. And I rarely feel rested when I wake up. Just… tired. Always tired. It's not a terrible problem, but it’s… annoying. It’s just… hard to relax, I suppose. Too many things going through my head. And sometimes my back aches, which doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Calvery. Now, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes my knees bother me. Especially when it's cold. And my hands get a little stiff in the mornings. But it’s nothing that a little bit of stretching doesn’t fix. Honestly, I’ve had aches and pains all my life. It comes with the territory, I suppose. Being old. And having been on my feet for so long. You get used to it. It's just... a dull ache. Not sharp, not terrible. Just... there.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Ms. Calvery. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, my vision isn't what it used to be, of course. Everything's a little blurry around the edges. I have to hold things closer to my face to read them. And my hearing... well, I sometimes have trouble hearing people when they're talking softly. Or when there's a lot of noise in the background. It’s just… old age again, I suppose. Everything’s fading, if you ask me. Fading around the edges.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Ms. Calvery. Now, one last thing for now: have you noticed any changes in your mood – feeling sad, anxious, or losing interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Oh, my mood… well, it comes and goes, I suppose. Some days I feel perfectly fine. Other days… I just feel a little… empty. Like something’s missing. But I don’t dwell on it. What’s the point? It’s just… old age again. Losing people, losing things… it all adds up, I suppose. Honestly, I'm mostly just tired. Tired of everything. Tired of remembering, tired of forgetting, tired of… well, everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Calvery. I appreciate you sharing all of this. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well… alright, I suppose. But don’t expect too much. I’m a bit… creaky. And I’m not very good at standing still. But I’ll try my best. Just… be gentle, dear. And try not to poke too much. What year is it again? It feels like things are slipping away from me.
DOCTOR: It's August 2nd, 2025. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. There. Is that good enough? I always feel a little silly doing this, you know? Like a child playing doctor. Though, I suppose I was the doctor for many years, wasn’t I? Well, the surgical kind. Not the… listening kind. Still. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Ms. Calvery. Your breathing sounds a little diminished, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax your stomach muscles for me. This may be a little uncomfortable. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit. It's not sharp, but… a dull ache, like indigestion, I suppose. I've had a bit of trouble with my stomach lately. Nothing terrible, just… uncomfortable. I don’t really eat much, so I suppose that doesn't help. Is something wrong, dear? Don't tell me it's something serious. I don't have the energy for serious.
DOCTOR: Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. There. It's not as easy as it used to be, you know? Getting old isn't for the faint of heart. Or the weak legs, I suppose. Go ahead. Do whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little slow, which is common with age. And your strength is a bit reduced, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to check your feet and ankles. Do you have any pain in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Especially in the mornings. My feet get a little stiff and achy. And the toenails… well, they’re just old. I used to take good care of them, but now… I don't really bother anymore. It's just one more thing to worry about. Honestly, I'm starting to forget what it's like to not ache somewhere. Is it serious, dear? Please tell me it's not serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery, I've completed the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed, it sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes, including decreased appetite, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, some mild arthritis, and possibly some mild indigestion. However, I would like to order some blood work and a urine test to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work. Urine tests. It sounds… complicated. And a little frightening, if I'm honest. But… alright, dear. If you think it's best. I just want to make sure everything is… alright. Or as alright as it can be, at my age. What will it involve? And will it hurt? I really don't like needles. What year is it again? Everything feels so… hazy.
DOCTOR: It's August 2nd, 2025, Ms. Calvery. Don't worry, it's a pretty straightforward process. For the blood work, a phlebotomist will take a small sample of blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and it's a small pinch – most people don't find it very painful. And for the urine test, you'll simply need to provide a sample in a cup. It’s completely painless. The results will help us to get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any potential issues. Would you like me to explain what we'll be looking for in the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A small pinch. I suppose I can handle a small pinch. And a cup? That doesn't sound too bad. But what will you be looking for? Honestly, I don't understand all the medical jargon. You doctors speak a different language, you know. Just… tell me if something is wrong. That's all I want to know. Don't sugarcoat it, but… be gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We'll keep it simple. The blood work will check things like your blood count, kidney and liver function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. This will help us to see if there's any underlying infection, any issues with your organs, or any signs of diabetes. The urine test will check for signs of infection in your urinary tract. If everything comes back normal, that's great – it means your age-related changes are likely the main cause of your symptoms. If anything is abnormal, we'll discuss it together and come up with a plan to address it. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood count, kidneys, liver… diabetes. It sounds… complicated. But yes, I think I understand. Just… look for anything wrong. And tell me what it means. Don’t use all those fancy doctor words. And… what about my tiredness? Is there anything you can do about the tiredness? I’m just… so tired all the time. That’s the worst part, you know? The constant tiredness.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Calvery. The tiredness is definitely something we need to address. While the tests will help rule out any underlying medical causes, such as anemia or thyroid issues, there are also things we can do to manage the fatigue even if the tests are normal. We can discuss some lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise, improving your diet, and practicing good sleep hygiene. And if those don't help, we can explore other options, such as vitamin supplementation or referral to a specialist. Now, before we finish, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… take care of me, alright? I’m an old woman, and I don’t have anyone else to worry about me. And… thank you. For listening. And for not making me feel foolish. What year is it again? I keep forgetting.
DOCTOR: It's August 2nd, 2025, Ms. Calvery. And you’re not foolish at all. I’m happy to help, and I promise to do everything I can to take care of you. My assistant will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a copy of the lab request form and a schedule of the tests. Take care, Ms. Calvery. And remember, you’re not alone.
