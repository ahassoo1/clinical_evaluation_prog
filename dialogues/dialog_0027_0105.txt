DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think. For my weight. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, it's all been a bit of a blur, and I don't really remember all the details about why exactly we’re doing this now, but it seems important.
DOCTOR: Okay, surgery for weight loss. That's perfectly alright. It is a big decision, and it's common to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take it slow. Just tell me what’s been going on from your perspective. When did you and your wife start considering surgery, and what are your biggest concerns or hopes regarding it?
PATIENT: Hmm… from my perspective… well, I’ve been, uh… bigger for a long time, I guess. It’s just gotten harder to do things, you know? Walking, even. My wife… she worries about my health, always has. I think she brought up the surgery first, maybe six months ago? It felt like a last resort sort of thing. As for hopes… I just want to be able to… do things again. Play with my grandkids, walk without getting winded… and I guess my wife wants me to be healthier, live longer. Concerns… I don’t know. I’m a little worried about the surgery itself, I suppose. And what it’ll be like afterwards. I don't really know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That's very understandable, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good you're thinking about both the benefits and the potential challenges. It sounds like regaining your ability to do things you enjoy is a major goal, and that’s excellent. Before we discuss specific surgical options, let's get a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions currently, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife usually handles all that. I think my blood pressure might be a little high sometimes, but I don’t really know for sure. She mentions it… I’ve never been told I have diabetes, though. Just… general aches and pains, you know, getting older. Nothing major. It's just… hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing football. Had surgery for that, I think. And… oh! I had my appendix taken out when I was younger, too. That was… a long time ago. Other than that… I don’t think so. Nothing recently, anyway. Honestly, it's all pretty fuzzy. My wife probably remembers more than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I eat pretty much anything. My wife sometimes says I shouldn't eat everything, but… that's different. No allergies, doctor. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a pain reliever sometimes for my back, just ibuprofen. Nothing regularly. And… oh! My wife gives me a vitamin D supplement in the winter, she says I don't get enough sun. But that's it, really. Just ibuprofen when needed and the vitamin D. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle, if you don't mind. This will help us determine if surgery is the right option for you, and if so, what type. First, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, um… my diet. Well, I like food, I guess. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but… I enjoy a good meal. I eat a lot of rice, and… uh… kebabs are good. I like pastries, too. I try not to eat too much, but… it's hard. We eat at home a lot, but sometimes we go out. I’m not very good at describing this, sorry. It’s just… normal food. Maybe too much of it sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. There's no need to apologize. It sounds like you enjoy a variety of foods, which is good. Now, do you drink alcohol, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, um… sometimes I have a beer with dinner. Maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing much. And no, I don’t smoke. Never have. My wife doesn't like smoking, and… well, it’s bad for you. So, just the occasional beer.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright. This will help me get a better understanding of your current health status. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. And I'll feel your abdomen as well. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need, doctor. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not very good with pain, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We'll need to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are a bit faint, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is a bit tender in the upper right side. It’s likely nothing serious, but we may want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay… tender, you say? I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes, after I eat. Especially if I eat something rich. Is that what you’re feeling? It doesn’t really hurt, just… uncomfortable. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It could be related to indigestion, yes. The tenderness could also be from your liver, but it’s too early to say definitively. That's why we need to do some further testing. I'd like to order some blood work and a basic metabolic panel to assess your liver function, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. We should also do a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. And given your blood pressure reading, a 24-hour blood pressure monitor wouldn't be a bad idea. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of tests. My wife will be glad you're being thorough, though. She always says I need to get checked out more. Yes, that sounds… alright. Whatever you think is best, doctor. When can I get these tests done? I hope they don’t take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can get these tests scheduled at the lab just down the street. They don't usually take too long, maybe an hour or so. And the results should be back within a few days. I’ll have my assistant schedule them for you before you leave. In the meantime, let’s talk about your weight loss goals again. What specifically are you hoping to achieve with surgery?
PATIENT: Um… well, like I said, I want to be able to do things again. Play with my grandkids without getting so tired. Walk without getting winded. Maybe… fit into some of my old clothes. That would be nice. I don’t know… I just want to feel… better. And my wife worries a lot, so if this will make her happy, then that’s good too. I guess I'm not really sure what's realistic, you know? I just want to feel less… heavy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Kochubey. Those are very reasonable goals, and they're certainly achievable with surgery. There are a few different options, including gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Each has its own benefits and risks, and the best option for you will depend on your overall health and your lifestyle. Given your current health status, and the need for further testing, I recommend we schedule a consultation with a bariatric surgeon once we have the results back. They can provide you with more detailed information about the different options and help you decide if surgery is right for you. Would that work?
PATIENT: A surgeon… yes, that sounds good. Once we have the test results. That makes sense. My wife will want to be there for that, too, I think. She does most of the talking, anyway. I just… want to get this sorted out. It’s all a bit overwhelming, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It is a lot to take in. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you or your wife may have. My assistant will schedule the lab tests and the consultation with the surgeon. Do you have any questions for me right now before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel… stupid. I forget things so easily, and I worry about bothering people. Not at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's my job to help you understand, and there’s no such thing as a stupid question. We’ll work through this together. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
