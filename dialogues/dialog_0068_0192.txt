DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, Doc. It’s about this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a waste of time, if you ask me, but rules are rules, I guess. It’s August 2nd, right? They were very specific about the date.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, yes, that’s correct. A pre-military physical… Right. Okay. And you said it feels like a waste of time?
PATIENT: Well, look, I keep myself in shape. Always have. I work with engines all day, it's physical work. Not sitting behind a desk, that’s for sure. I’m strong, I don't get sick. I doubt you'll find anything wrong. Honestly, I think it’s a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Still, the military has their protocols, and it's best to fulfill them. We need to document everything thoroughly. Let’s start with a little background, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? No. A few colds, maybe. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up just fine. Nothing… serious. My wife keeps telling me to go to the doctor when I cough, but it always goes away. It’s just a cough! They make such a big deal about everything these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, otherwise generally healthy… No ongoing medical problems. Any family history of… well, anything significant?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she… well, she just got old. It happens. Nothing dramatic, like some of those TV shows. No heart problems, no cancer, nothing like that. They lived a long life, mostly. Is this important? It feels like you're looking for something to find.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a complete picture. High blood pressure in your father… noted. And, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Vitamins? Sometimes my wife makes me take a multivitamin, but I forget half the time. Supplements? Absolutely not. I get everything I need from my food. Real food, not those fancy powders everyone's selling these days. I’m a simple man, Doc. I eat, I work, I sleep. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had one. Bees stung me a couple times as a kid, but no big deal. A little swelling, that’s all. My wife always says I’m too tough to be allergic to anything. She’s probably right, to be honest. I don't react to much.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Seriously? Look at me, Doc. Do I look like the type? No. Never touched a thing in my life. Smoke? No. Drink? Occasionally. A beer with dinner, maybe. A glass of wine on a special occasion. But nothing… excessive. I need a clear head for my work. Engines don't fix themselves, you know. It's all about responsibility.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, can you describe your current level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity? I just told you, I work with engines all day! It’s hard work, lifting, bending, tightening bolts… It’s not like I’m sitting around doing nothing. I’m on my feet for eight, ten hours a day. I’m probably in better shape than half the guys your age. See? I don’t need a gym membership.
DOCTOR: Alright, strenuous physical activity related to your work. Now, have you experienced any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms? No. Maybe a little bit of stiffness in my back sometimes, after a long day, but nothing a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. Honestly, Doc, I’m perfectly fine. My wife just worries too much. She’s always sending me to doctors for nothing. It's a waste of everyone's time, if you ask me. But, I'm here, aren't I? Doing what they want.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. However, it's my responsibility to gather as much information as possible. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or any other senses?
PATIENT: Changes? No. I see fine, hear fine. Maybe my hearing isn't what it used to be, getting older, I guess, but who's hearing is? It's not like I need to hear a mouse sneeze. Everything works. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. Are we going to get to the actual exam now, or are you going to keep asking me questions about things that aren't wrong? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can proceed with the physical exam. It will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then a basic examination of your heart, lungs, and musculoskeletal system. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with, then. Vital signs, heart, lungs… whatever. I haven’t got all day. And please, don’t tell me I need to start taking vitamins. Let’s just do it.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please sit up on the examination table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. Just get it done. I don't like sitting around. It's a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. Slightly elevated, but we'll monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Your heart rate is a little fast, 82 beats per minute. And the rhythm is regular. I’m hearing a slight murmur, nothing alarming right now, but we should keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: Murmur? What's a murmur? Is that bad? I told you I was fine. My wife is going to have a field day with this. Just a little fast, you say? I probably had a coffee this morning. This is ridiculous. Just tell me if I can leave now.
DOCTOR: A murmur is simply an extra sound heard during the heartbeat. Many murmurs are harmless and don't require treatment. However, it's best to investigate further to determine the cause. I'm not saying it is something serious, but we need to rule things out. Now, let's check your abdomen. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little bit… there. It’s probably just indigestion. I had a pretty big lunch. Nothing to worry about. You’re pressing pretty hard. Honestly, Doc, you’re going to find something if you push hard enough on anyone. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do, you know. My wife will kill me if I'm gone all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. No masses or significant distention. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Relax your leg… and relax. Reflexes are normal, two plus bilaterally. Let's take a look at your ears and throat now. Open your mouth, please. Everything looks normal in your ears and throat. No signs of infection. Okay, that completes the physical exam. I'll review my notes and we can discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Finally. Next steps? What next steps? I thought this was just a formality. You said everything was normal. So, can I go now? Honestly, all this poking and prodding for… what exactly? A little tenderness? My wife will have a list of things for me to do. I have work to do, and she expects me to finish it. Just tell me if I’m fit to go, or if I need to start taking vitamins. Don't make me spend the whole afternoon in this place.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, while your general physical exam appears largely normal, the slightly elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, and the tenderness in your abdomen warrant further investigation. I wouldn't say you're unfit to go, but I recommend some additional testing to rule out any underlying issues. Specifically, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an electrocardiogram to assess your heart function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: More testing?! Seriously? You said everything was fine! Complete blood count, metabolic panel, electrocardiogram... It sounds like you're trying to find something wrong with me. I knew it. I knew this was a waste of time. My wife is going to be thrilled. She always says I need to see a doctor. Fine. Do your tests. Just get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing, I'm never coming back. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Where do I go to get these tests done? And how long is this going to take? I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. You'll need to give them this requisition form. The EKG will be done in the same room. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two to complete both tests. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and staying hydrated. And please, try not to stress. We're just being thorough. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Limiting salt? Hydrating? My wife will be pleased with that advice. Probably already telling me to do that. No, I don't have any other questions. Just tell me how long it will be before I get the results. And try to make it quick, okay? I don't want to spend my whole life in a doctor's office. Fine. I'm going. .
