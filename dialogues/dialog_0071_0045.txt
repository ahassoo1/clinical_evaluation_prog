DOCTOR: Right, hello Mr. Withycombe. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It’s… flushing. I get very red, you see. Like, my face, and sometimes my neck. It happens sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Hmm, flushing. Okay. And you say “sometimes”?
PATIENT: Yes. Not every day. Maybe two, three times a week? It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes it’s after I eat… spicy food, maybe? Or when I get a little bit… worked up. Not angry, just… feeling things. It’s not… painful, just… warm. Very warm. And red. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Warm and red, triggered by spicy food or, shall we say, heightened emotion. And it’s been happening for… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It’s been… maybe six months now? It started slow, just after… well, after my wife passed. But it’s gotten more… noticeable lately, I suppose. Not a big problem, but it’s… unsettling. I don’t like looking so red. Makes me feel… shy.
DOCTOR: Six months… coinciding with a difficult time, I see. And it’s more noticeable lately. Alright. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the flushing?
PATIENT: Accompanying? Like… with it? Hmm. Sometimes my heart… beats a little fast. Not racing, just… quicker than usual. And… I get a little bit sweaty. Mostly on my forehead. Not a lot, just… a little bit damp. Does that make sense? It doesn't happen every time, only sometimes with the redness.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased heart rate and mild sweating. And is this happening mostly with the spicy food, or more with… emotional situations?
PATIENT: It's… harder to say, Doctor. I think… maybe more with the feelings. The food sometimes, yes, but that I can usually control. Less spicy, you know? But the other thing… it just happens. When I’m… remembering things, or thinking about things. Or even when I'm just… talking to people sometimes. It's a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be unsettling when things happen without a clear trigger. Alright. Let’s take a quick look at your blood pressure and pulse just to get a baseline. Then we can talk a bit more about your medical history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Blood pressure is fine, I suppose. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Though I do like my mangoes…
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Mangoes are good! Let's get this reading quickly. Okay… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 82. Let’s just listen to your heart and lungs quickly as well. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. No… not really. Maybe… I've been a bit tired lately. But that could just be… getting older, you know? And… my stomach hasn’t been quite right sometimes. A little bit… gassy. But nothing… serious, I think. Mostly just uncomfortable. And… I sleep alright, usually. I used to snore, but my wife always said that didn't bother her.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, some gastric discomfort… alright. And you've had this fatigue for… how long?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe a few months as well? It’s hard to remember exactly. Everything feels a bit… blurry lately, to be honest. It started around the same time as the flushing, I think. I just… don’t have as much energy as I used to. It doesn't stop me from doing things, but I get tired quicker, you see? Easier to rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. No, not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my wife… she had some problems with her heart, but that was her, not me. Nothing major for me, Doctor. I’ve always been… quite healthy, actually. Or, I thought I was. Before all this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Not even for my teeth, thankfully! My wife, she had her wisdom teeth out when she was young. But me? Nothing. I just… brush and floss. Doctor, is this… serious? I’m starting to get a little worried now. The flushing, the tiredness… It's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're voicing your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when experiencing new symptoms. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, but we'll investigate thoroughly. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. He passed away when I was young, so I don't remember much. My mother, she was healthy as a horse. Lived to be 90. No heart problems, no… anything really. My wife's side… her mother had some arthritis, but that was it, as far as I know. Nothing… major. We didn't really talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of hypertension, otherwise healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. Never needed any. And no allergies, as far as I know. I can eat anything, thankfully. My wife, she was allergic to shellfish. But me? Nothing. I like all kinds of food. Except maybe very, very spicy things. They make my face red!
DOCTOR: Alright Mr. Withycombe, thank you for that information. Given your symptoms – the flushing, fatigue, and occasional heart rate increase – along with the timing coinciding with a difficult life event, it’s important to rule out a few possibilities. It could be related to stress and anxiety, but we should also investigate other potential causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test just to get a baseline. It would also be helpful to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can give you a simple device to use. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A good idea. I trust your judgment. Blood tests are fine. And the… device? To check my blood pressure? Yes, that's good. Anything to find out what's going on. I just… want to feel normal again. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Withycombe. My pleasure. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll also have her show you how to use the blood pressure monitor. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen significantly – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything. I’ll just… try to relax, I suppose. And I’ll do the tests. Thank you again for everything.
