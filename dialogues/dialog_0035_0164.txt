DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been feeling really unwell after eating fava beans. My skin and eyes are…yellowish, and I just feel weak and tired all the time. It started a few weeks ago, and it only happens after I eat them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing of the skin and eyes, and weakness and fatigue... and it's specifically related to eating fava beans. That is something we need to investigate. To start, can you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t do things, exactly. It’s more…like everything takes a lot more effort. Just getting up the stairs leaves me breathless, and I find myself needing naps during the day, which I never used to do. And I feel…sort of shaky sometimes, too. Like my muscles are tired. It’s hard to explain. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased effort for everyday activities, shortness of breath with exertion, daytime fatigue, and some muscle shakiness. Has this been getting progressively worse since it started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. When it first started, I just felt a little tired for a day or so after eating them. Now, it lasts for almost a week, and it's getting harder and harder to bounce back. It feels…more intense each time. I actually thought it was just a really bad flu at first, but then I realized it always happened after the beans.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be clear, how often are you eating these fava beans?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often! That's why it took me so long to figure out what was going on. It’s a traditional dish my mother used to make, and I’ll have it when I visit her, maybe once a month or so. And then sometimes I’ll find them at the farmer’s market and get a little nostalgic. But it’s not a regular thing, really. Just…special occasions, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the yellowing, fatigue, and shakiness?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little more short of breath than usual, even when I haven't eaten the beans, but I just put that down to the heat we've been having. And…oh! My urine has been darker than usual, a sort of…tea color. I didn’t think much of it, I assumed I was just dehydrated. Is that…relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, the darker urine is relevant. And the shortness of breath, even without eating the beans, is something we need to consider. Before we proceed with a physical exam, let me ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers if I have a headache, that’s it. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, no regular medications, appendectomy as a teenager. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had some heart trouble when he was older, and my mother has arthritis. Nothing… major, as far as I know. Oh, and my grandfather on my mother’s side… he was from a very small village in Romania, and I remember hearing stories about people getting sick after eating certain kinds of beans. But it was so long ago, and everyone spoke very little English, so it was hard to understand exactly what was going on. It was just…a family tale, really. I never thought much of it until now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A family history of heart trouble, arthritis, and this…story about illness related to beans in Romania. That’s potentially helpful information. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: I don’t have any known allergies, Doctor. I can eat pretty much anything without any problems. I've never had a reaction to food, or medications, or anything like that. I’m not allergic to bee stings, or pollen, or anything of the sort. I'm quite lucky, really. I’ve always envied people who have to carry around EpiPens!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And lastly, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… okay. Well, I live alone. I’ve never married. I work as a receptionist at a doctor’s office, actually - a different one, not this one. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol very occasionally, maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I go for walks when the weather is nice. It’s a pretty quiet life, really. But I enjoy it. I like reading and going to the movies. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That gives me a good overview. Now, I would like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Then I’ll want to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Thank you for listening so carefully. I've been a bit worried about this, so I appreciate you taking the time to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take deep breaths for me, please. In and out... Good. I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt, Doctor. Just a little…uncomfortable, perhaps. It’s always been a bit sensitive, but not particularly painful. It feels…full, maybe? Like I’ve eaten a lot. But I haven't, really. It’s just…a feeling. I hope that makes sense. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Some mild discomfort and fullness. I’m noting some slight enlargement of the liver on palpation, but it’s subtle. Now I'm going to check your sclera - the whites of your eyes. Yes, I do notice some jaundice – a yellowish discoloration. And your skin also appears slightly yellowed. The combination of these findings, along with your symptoms and history of eating fava beans, is raising my suspicion for a condition called G6PD deficiency. But we need blood tests to confirm. I'm going to order a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Is that alright?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? That sounds…serious. Is that what the family story about the beans was about, do you think? And what does that mean, exactly? I mean, what happens if I have it? Will I have to stop eating everything? I’m a bit scared now, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. And if I stop eating beans, will I be okay?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, but it's manageable. G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition where your body doesn't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD, which protects your red blood cells. Certain things, like fava beans, certain medications, and even infections, can cause your red blood cells to break down, leading to jaundice, fatigue, and anemia. That family story…it very well could have been G6PD deficiency. As for what happens if you have it, it doesn't mean you have to stop eating everything. It means you need to avoid triggers – fava beans are a big one, and we'll also need to be careful about certain medications. We will review all your medications and any supplements you take. Right now, let’s not jump to conclusions. We need the blood test results to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, please avoid eating fava beans and any foods containing them. And if you experience any sudden weakness, shortness of breath, or dark urine, go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to order the blood tests now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them in detail and create a plan to manage your condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…better, thank you. Avoiding the beans is fine, I can do that. I'll be very careful. And I will absolutely go to the emergency room if I feel unwell. It's good to know what to look for. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Alzoubi. I really appreciate it. I'm still a bit worried, but I feel better knowing we're trying to figure it out. When should I expect to hear about the blood test results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. I understand your worry. The lab usually takes 2-3 business days to process the results. They'll contact you directly, but you can also call the lab and give them your patient number. I'll also make a note to check on you in a few days to see if you've heard back and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Do you have any other questions for me right now before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. I feel much more at ease. I'll call the lab in a few days if I haven't heard back. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Mande. Take care, and please do call if you need anything.
