DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Janie. Um… what brings me in? Right. It’s… this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for… a long time, I guess. I don't really keep track of these things anymore. It's just… draining.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie. “Draining” is a good way to put it. Fatigue can be quite debilitating. When you say “a long time,” could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Rough estimate… hmm. It feels like… since my husband passed, maybe? That was… oh, let me think… five years ago? Six? It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. It wasn’t this bad right away, it just… gradually got worse. I don’t know if that helps. It's hard to remember specifics.
DOCTOR: That absolutely helps, Janie. Losing your husband is a significant event, and grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including fatigue. And it’s perfectly understandable that remembering specifics is difficult. So, this tiredness has been progressively worsening over the past five or six years. Could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just… sleepy. It’s… like my batteries are always running low. Even after a full night’s sleep – and I do sleep, thank goodness – I wake up feeling like I haven't rested at all. Everything feels like a huge effort. Walking, even just… thinking. It's hard to explain. And sometimes I just feel… weak. Like I could just… collapse. Is that making sense? I'm probably not saying it very well.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Janie. You’re describing a significant lack of energy and a feeling of depletion, even with adequate sleep. The weakness is concerning as well. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically makes the tiredness worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, physical activity definitely makes it worse. Even just going to the grocery store, you know? And… stress, I suppose. Though, who doesn’t get stressed these days? I used to enjoy gardening, but now… I just don't have the energy for it. It’s a shame, really. I can't really think of anything that makes it better, to be honest. Just… lying down, I guess. But then I feel guilty for wasting the day.
DOCTOR: I see. So, exertion and stress exacerbate the fatigue, and rest provides some temporary relief, but it doesn't fully resolve the issue. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh… other symptoms. Let me think. I… sometimes I have trouble concentrating. My memory isn’t what it used to be, of course, but it feels… worse lately. And I’ve been a little… achy. Just general aches and pains. Nothing specific, really. And… I’ve lost my appetite a bit. Not a huge amount, but I don't really feel like eating. Does that make sense? I'm just… not very hungry. I think. It’s hard to tell, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Janie. Thank you for sharing that. Difficulty concentrating, memory issues, generalized aches, and a decreased appetite are all important pieces of information. To help me understand your overall health picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… I had… the usual, I suppose. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. And… I had a bad flu a few years ago. Nothing major. I’ve always been fairly healthy, to be honest. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years. I think. The doctor keeps changing my pills, so I’m not even sure what I’m on anymore. And I had a knee replacement about ten years ago. But that’s healed up fine. Is that helpful? I really don’t keep track of these things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Janie. Thank you. It sounds like you’ve had a reasonably healthy life overall, but with a history of high blood pressure currently managed with medication, and a previous knee replacement. And just to clarify, are you currently taking any other medications besides the ones for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… … I think… just a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were a bit low last year. And… sometimes I take something for… heartburn? I forget the name. It's a little pink pill. I only take it when I need it. That's it, I think. Unless… oh, sometimes I take a pain reliever for my knee, if it’s acting up. But that's just as needed, too. It's all a bit… scattered. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Janie. It's perfectly common to have a lot on your mind, and medications can be confusing. So, to summarize: you take medication for high blood pressure, a Vitamin D supplement, an as-needed medication for heartburn, and an as-needed pain reliever for your knee. Now, have you ever had any surgeries besides your knee replacement?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries... I don’t think so. No, I’m pretty sure it was just the knee. I remember being very scared before the knee surgery, and then the recovery was… long. But no, nothing else that I can recall. My mother had her gallbladder out, but that was a long time ago. … Oh! Wait. I had a… a procedure. A small one. The doctor… removed a mole from my back a few years ago. But it was just a quick thing. They numbed it and… snip. It didn’t hurt. Is that considered a surgery? I'm not sure. It felt more like a… a fancy band-aid.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Janie. Even a small procedure like a mole removal is helpful information. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me see. My mother had… diabetes, I think. And she had heart problems towards the end of her life. My father… he was fairly healthy, actually. He lived to be… eighty-something. He had high blood pressure too, now that I think about it. And… my sister had… arthritis, I believe. But that's about all I can remember. We weren't a very… talkative family. We didn't really discuss these things. It's all a bit hazy, to be honest. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Janie. It's perfectly common not to have detailed family medical history. So, to summarize, a history of diabetes and heart problems in your mother, high blood pressure in your father, and arthritis in your sister. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired now, so I don’t work. I used to be a pharmacy technician, but that was a long time ago. I live alone. I don't drive anymore, so I rely on friends and family to take me places. I used to enjoy gardening, like I said, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard sometimes. I mostly just watch television and read. It's a quiet life. A very quiet life. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Janie. It sounds like you lead a relatively quiet life in retirement. Now, have you ever smoked, or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. My husband smoked, for a while, but I always told him it was terrible for him. And he eventually quit, thank goodness. But no, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I don't like the smell of it. It’s a terrible habit. Is that all? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Janie. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Let me think... I don't think so. I haven't had any serious reactions to anything, that I can recall. I'm a little sensitive to pollen, sometimes, in the spring. I get a runny nose and itchy eyes. But that's not really an allergy, is it? Just… springtime sniffles. No, I don’t think I have any true allergies. Not that I’m aware of. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie, thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. That gives me a much clearer picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general assessment of your physical well-being. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I suppose the sooner we get it over with, the better. Just… be gentle, please. I’m not as strong as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Janie. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so, given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lower lungs. This could be due to a number of things, like fluid retention or early signs of congestion. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but that’s not uncommon with age. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Okay, Janie. Based on my examination, and everything you’ve told me, I think it's important to investigate the cause of your fatigue, the crackling in your lungs, and the swelling in your ankles. I would like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work and an X-ray. That sounds… serious. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Of course. Whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. I just… I want to be able to do things again, you know? When can I have these tests done? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious, but we're going to get to the bottom of this. The blood work is quite simple - just a few tubes of blood drawn from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. As for the chest X-ray, it’s also non-invasive. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of the machine while a picture is taken. It doesn't hurt at all. I'll write you an order for both tests. You can go to the lab and radiology department here at the clinic. They’re open Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. You don’t need an appointment. Just bring your insurance card and this order form. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant swelling in your legs, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… very clear. Monday through Friday, 8 to 5. Insurance card and the order form. Shortness of breath, chest pain, swelling. And… what do you think is wrong, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just… I don’t want to worry my daughter. She already has enough on her plate.
DOCTOR: Janie, it's too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. There are many possibilities, ranging from mild to more serious. The fatigue, crackling in your lungs, and swelling in your ankles could be related to a number of things, such as heart problems, lung issues, or even kidney problems. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It's important not to jump to conclusions before we have all the information. I understand your concern about worrying your daughter, and we can certainly discuss what information you want to share with her. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and finding out what’s causing your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… thank you, Doctor. For listening to me. And for not dismissing me. It’s… it’s a relief to finally be taking this seriously. I think I’ll just… go home and rest. And try not to worry. I’ll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janie. I’m glad I could help. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. I’ll see you next week. .
