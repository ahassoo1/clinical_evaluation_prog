DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Havird. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, to be honest… I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about. My niece kept telling me I should get “checked out.” She worries too much, that one. It’s not like anything’s wrong, you know? Just… preventative, I guess. Though, I can't even remember the last time I had a proper check-up. It’s been ages.
DOCTOR: Preventative is good, I suppose… though usually people come in because something feels wrong. Still. Alright. So, you’re saying no specific complaints?
PATIENT: No, no complaints. Nothing aches that isn't just… getting old. Though my hands do get a bit stiff sometimes, but that’s from all the scrubbing back in the OR, isn't it? I was a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades. A long time. It’s not a problem, really. Just… old hands. You wouldn't understand, probably. It's different work these days.
DOCTOR: Surgical tech, alright. A lot of repetitive motion. We'll need to ask about that later, just to be thorough. But for now… let’s start with a general overview. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my weight? Oh, goodness. Well… I think I might have put a little on. My clothes are getting a bit snug, if that’s what you mean. But I blame it on the winter. And the cookies my granddaughter brings. She’s a lovely girl, but she makes amazing chocolate chip cookies. It’s hard to say no. I haven’t really tried to change it, you know? It’s not bothering me.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. Any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm… not really. I still eat like a horse, to be honest. Always have. Korean food is just so good, you see. Lots of kimchi, lots of rice. Though, maybe I don't get around to cooking as much as I used to. It's easier to just grab something simple. But I'm not less hungry, if that makes sense. I just… don’t bother with fancy things anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Trouble sleeping? Well, I wake up a bit in the middle of the night sometimes. It's just… old age, I suppose. You know, you get a little ache here, a little ache there, have to go to the bathroom. It's not like I toss and turn all night. Just a little… adjusting. I used to sleep like a log, but things change, don't they? It’s not a problem, mind you. I just… get up and read a bit, then go back to sleep. It’s not keeping me from anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re getting into the complicated stuff. Honestly, I’ve been to so many doctors over the years, I can barely remember. I think my blood pressure was a little high once, but they gave me a pill for it, and I took it for a while. I don’t even remember what it was called. And… something about my cholesterol, maybe? My husband used to keep track of all that. He was very organized. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. I wasn’t ever terribly sick, though. Just… the usual aches and pains. Nothing that needed a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A hysterectomy, ages ago. And… I had my appendix out when I was young. And I broke my wrist once, slipping on the ice. But that was a long time ago, and they fixed it right up. Nothing major, really. And I had a gallbladder removed, maybe? It’s all getting so mixed up. I think it was my sister who had the gallbladder issues, actually. She always did have trouble with her stomach. I just… get things confused sometimes, you know? It's the age. It just… fades away. It wasn’t anything serious. I don't even remember going to the hospital. It’s all such a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's try family history. Any major illnesses in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother had something with her heart, I think. She was very frail, always complaining of palpitations. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… cancer, I believe. Lung cancer, maybe? He smoked like a chimney. And my sister, she had diabetes, but she managed it pretty well with pills. Honestly, it's hard to remember everything. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It was considered bad luck, you know? Just… better not to dwell on it. I just know they lived to be quite old, despite everything. That's what matters, isn't it? They were strong women. It's all very hazy, though. I apologize. It wasn’t a terribly important family, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Maybe a little bit of a rash once from a new soap, but that was years ago. Nothing serious. I used to take penicillin when I was young, but that was a long time ago. My niece is terribly allergic to peanuts, but that's not me. I eat everything. I was always a very healthy child, despite everything. And I've never had trouble with bee stings or anything like that, thankfully. It just isn’t something I worry about, you know? A simple life, you see. Not much to be allergic to. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. Don’t bother with those details, dear. It’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. Well, I take a little vitamin D in the winter. My niece says I don't get enough sun. And… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my arthritis. Just when it flares up, you see. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The regular kind. Nothing fancy. Oh, and sometimes a little something for my sleep. Just a tiny pill, when I can't quite settle. But it's not every night. Maybe once a week, if that. Honestly, I try not to take too many pills. I don't like feeling drugged up. It’s all very simple, dear. Just the usual old lady things, you know? Don’t bother with the details. It isn’t important. I'm not a complicated case, you see.
