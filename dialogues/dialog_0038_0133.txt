DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, lovely to meet you too. Well, to be quick about it, I just need some forms notarized. They’re health forms, and I need them verified. I don’t have insurance, so it's a bit complicated, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Notarizing health forms isn’t typically something we do here at the clinic, as we are a medical facility focused on providing healthcare. However, let’s see if I can point you in the right direction. To be absolutely sure, are these forms specifically requiring a medical verification of health information, or simply a signature as a witness?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that's not good. I… I'm not entirely sure, Doctor. The lady at the office just said I needed them "verified" and that a doctor had to do it. They’re for a program... something about help with rent, I think. She didn’t really explain much. Would a signature work, then? That'd be much easier.
DOCTOR: Okay, that clarifies things a bit. A simple signature as a witness is something I can certainly do. “Verification” can mean different things. If it’s simply confirming your identity and witnessing your signature, that’s no problem at all. To be on the safe side, do you happen to have a copy of the forms themselves, or perhaps the instructions you received?
PATIENT: Yes, here they are. I think this is everything. It’s a bit of a mess, I apologize. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. It says something about confirming I’m still… able to live independently? And then a place for a signature and a notary seal. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. This is an Affidavit of Independent Living, required for the rental assistance program. It does require a notarization, and a doctor's signature confirming your ability to manage your own affairs. It looks like they want confirmation of your cognitive and physical ability to live independently. I can sign it, confirming that, based on my brief conversation with you and a quick assessment. But it's important to understand that this is a limited assessment, and not a full medical evaluation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. A quick assessment is just fine. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable. Just a bit forgetful sometimes, you know? But I manage. Truly. I just need the form signed so I can get this sorted. It’s been such a headache. And thank you for being so understanding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. Forgetfulness is very common, especially as we get older. No problem at all. Let's do a quick check. I'll ask you a few simple questions just to confirm things, and then we can sign the form. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll do my best. It’s just… try not to make them too complicated, please? My mind doesn't work as fast as it used to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. No complicated questions, I promise. Just a few simple ones to get a better understanding. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Let me think. It’s… August, isn’t it? And the… second? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I hope so. I usually remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely right! August 2nd, 2025. Very good! Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, we’re at the doctor’s office. Doctor Auelua’s office, to be exact. It's… a rural clinic, isn’t it? A bit out of town. It’s very nice, though. Quiet.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. It is a rural clinic. You have a very good memory for places! Now, just one more quick question. Can you tell me briefly why you came in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy! I need these health forms signed and notarized. So I can get this rental assistance sorted out. That’s all. It’s been quite a process, you see. Just wanting to prove I’m still capable of managing on my own.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia, that's perfect. Based on our conversation today, I can confirm that you are alert, oriented, and capable of understanding and managing your own affairs. I am happy to sign this affidavit for you. Here you go. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, that's wonderful! Thank you so much. You’ve been a lifesaver. No, I think that’s all. Just this. I really appreciate your time and understanding. Truly. .
