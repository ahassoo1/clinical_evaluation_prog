DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, um… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve just been… forgetting things. Little things at first, you know? But it’s been happening more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is concerning when you notice changes in your memory. It's good you came in to discuss it. "Little things" can be very significant. Could you give me some examples of what you mean by “little things”?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Let me think. Just last week, I went to the grocery store and completely forgot what I went there for! I just stood there, staring at the produce section. And yesterday, I couldn’t remember where I put my car keys. I eventually found them, but it took me a good fifteen minutes of searching. It’s things like that. Not… huge things, but enough to make me feel… off.
DOCTOR: I see. So, recent onset of forgetfulness, affecting everyday tasks… forgetting the purpose of errands, misplacing items. And you say this has been increasing in frequency?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s definitely getting worse. It feels like it started maybe… six months ago? But the last couple of months have been the most noticeable. It's not like I can’t function, you know? I still go to work, I can still do my job… but I have to really concentrate, and sometimes even then I slip up. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating is a good word for it. And you haven’t experienced any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I just figured that was from working long hours. Nothing else comes to mind, no… dizziness or anything like that. Just the forgetting. Is that normal? I really don’t know what to expect, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Fatigue can certainly contribute to cognitive difficulties, so that’s important to note. It’s good you’re being so thorough. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Um… let’s see. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that was a long time ago. No serious illnesses, no… nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, actually. I do get regular check-ups with my family doctor, though. I can’t remember the last time I saw her, though. Funny, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is… noteworthy. We’ll try to get those records. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Um… my mother… she was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s when she was in her late seventies. It was… hard. She needed a lot of care. And my father, he… he had some heart problems, but nothing else really comes to mind. I don’t really know much about the health history on either side, to be honest. They’re both gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s… a significant piece of information, given your mother’s diagnosis. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Okay… well, I work as a dentist, so I’m pretty busy. Long hours, lots of concentration. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re always on the go. I don’t really have time for a lot of exercise, which I know I should do more of. And I don't drink or smoke. I mostly just… work. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Now, let's discuss any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin, just a standard one. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Oh, and I used to take something for allergies, but I switched to a different brand a few years ago and it seems to work okay now. I don’t think I have any serious allergies, though. Nothing that’s ever landed me in the hospital, anyway. Is there anything else I should be telling you?
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s a good start. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please tell me the date today?
PATIENT: Oh… um… It’s… August… the second? 2025? I think. Is that right? I always have trouble with dates.
DOCTOR: That is correct, August 2nd, 2025. Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and can you tell me your name and date of birth for me?
PATIENT: My name is Ebony Heidenthal. And my date of birth is… Oh dear. This is… embarrassing. I know it, I just… can't seem to pull it up right now. It’s in the… early seventies? I'm 38 now. But the exact date… I’m sorry. It’s like it’s right there, but… blocked.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Please don’t apologize. These things happen. It’s not uncommon to have temporary difficulty recalling information, especially when you’re already feeling anxious. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words. Listen carefully: apple, table, pencil. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… pencil. Yes, I can remember those. Apple, table, pencil. Is there anything else? I'm worried I'm going to forget them in a second.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh… um… Is it… 2024? No… 2025? I think it's 2025, but I'm really not sure. It's hard to keep track. I used to be so good with dates.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Heidenthal, based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary findings from this brief exam, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties. While it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, your symptoms—forgetfulness, difficulty recalling recent information, confusion with dates—are concerning. I recommend further evaluation to determine the cause of these symptoms. This may include blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and a more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. We also may consider a brain imaging study, such as an MRI, to assess the structure of your brain. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… an MRI… I… I guess so. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes. I just… I’m scared, Doctor. What if it’s something bad? Like… like my mother? I don't want to end up like her. But I also don't want to just sit here and pretend everything is okay.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Ms. Heidenthal. It's natural to be worried. However, it’s important to remember that your symptoms don’t necessarily mean you have the same condition as your mother. There are many possible causes for cognitive difficulties, and we won’t know for sure until we’ve completed the necessary tests. We will work through this together, step by step. First, I’ll order a complete blood panel to rule out any vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or other medical problems that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’ll also schedule you an appointment with a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. They can perform the neuropsychological assessment and determine if an MRI is needed. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that require a lot of concentration and getting plenty of rest. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out to me or my staff if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m… overwhelmed. I just need to process everything. The neurologist… how long will that take to schedule? And… will I be able to drive myself to the appointments? I don’t want to… rely on anyone if I don’t have to.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. My staff will contact you to schedule the appointment with the neurologist. It may take a week or two to get an appointment, depending on their availability. Regarding driving, I would advise against driving yourself to the neurologist appointment until after you’ve been evaluated. It’s best to have someone accompany you, or to take a taxi or rideshare service, just to be safe. We'll also provide you with a list of resources and support groups in the area, should you find them helpful. Before you leave, I’d like to give you a summary of our conversation, including the tests we’ve ordered and the contact information for the neurologist's office. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions before we conclude for today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for listening, and for not… dismissing me. I appreciate your patience. I… I guess I should go. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing that we're trying to figure it out. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It was my pleasure. And you’re right, we are going to figure it out. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or if anything changes. My staff is available to help with scheduling and any other concerns you may have. Take care of yourself, and remember, you're not alone in this. We'll be in touch soon.
