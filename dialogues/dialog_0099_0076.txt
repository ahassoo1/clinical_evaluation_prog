DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…sore. Not always, but when I rub against something, or even sometimes just when I’m standing, they really hurt. They’ve been bothering me for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Alright. And how many would you estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Maybe… six or seven? On both legs together. They're not huge, thankfully. Pea-sized, maybe a little bigger. But they’re definitely noticeable, and like I said, painful. Especially after work.
DOCTOR: Right. And what sort of work do you do, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, I move things around. Freight, you know? At the warehouse. Boxes, pallets... mostly by hand. It’s a lot of walking and standing. Been doing it for…a long time now, honestly. It keeps me busy, at least. My wife keeps telling me to retire, but what would I do all day?
DOCTOR: So, a fair amount of physical exertion then. And these bumps…do they come and go, or are they pretty constant now?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, I’d say. They don't disappear completely, but sometimes they look a little… flatter? Less red? But they always come back, especially after a long day at work. I haven't really noticed them getting better on their own, if that makes sense. They just... are.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to treat them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, just regular stuff. I put some lotion on them sometimes. Nothing fancy, just whatever my wife has. It helps a little with the dryness, maybe, but doesn't really take the pain away. I haven’t put anything special on them, no. Never had anything like this before, so I didn’t really know what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at them. If you wouldn't mind rolling up your trousers, please. I need to get a good visual. And I’ll probably need to palpate them, just feel around a bit.
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There. You can see them pretty clearly now. They’re kinda…tender to the touch, so be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Hm. Yes, I see. They are raised, erythematous…and definitely tender to palpation. There’s no active ulceration, no drainage that I can see. Skin temperature is normal bilaterally. No significant edema. It appears you also have some mild hyperpigmentation around some of these lesions. Have you noticed any other skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Hyperpigmentation? I don’t know about that… what does that mean? My skin’s always been…brown, you know? I’m Filipino. But I haven’t noticed anything new, not that I know of. Maybe a little darker where the bumps used to be really bad? But I haven’t really paid much attention. I mostly just worry about these ones on my shins. They make walking uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right. Hyperpigmentation simply means darkening of the skin. It’s not unusual, especially after inflammation. It seems likely these bumps are related to your work. Given the location and your occupation, I’m suspecting stasis dermatitis, possibly with some secondary infection. It's common in people who spend a lot of time on their feet. However, to rule out other possibilities—like cellulitis or a deep vein thrombosis—I’m going to order a lower extremity ultrasound and some blood work. It's a precaution, of course. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Ultrasound and blood work? Is it… serious? I just thought it was, you know, bumps from working too hard. Are you saying it could be something… worse? I don't like the sound of 'thrombosis' at all. My wife would be so worried. Is it going to keep me from work? I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Mr. Aluia, I understand your concern, but you’re jumping to conclusions. It's standard procedure to rule out more serious conditions, especially given the location and your symptoms. A thrombosis, a blood clot, could be a possibility, but it's not likely. The ultrasound will tell us definitively. As for keeping you from work, it depends on the results. We’ll discuss it after the tests. For now, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and keeping the area clean and dry. We’ll get the orders for the blood work and ultrasound sent to the lab. And I’m going to prescribe a topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation. It's a mild cream, nothing to be alarmed about. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Compression stockings… I think my wife has some. And a cream…that’s alright. Topical sounds good. Less scary than…other things. So, just the blood work and ultrasound, and the cream for now? And then we see what happens? That sounds… manageable. Yes. That sounds acceptable, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you checking it out. Hopefully, it's just from too much walking.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work. The ultrasound facility is located at the medical center; their number is on the requisition I’m sending over to you now. Use that number to book your appointment. Follow the instructions on the cream packaging carefully. If your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, contact the clinic immediately. We'll review the results in one week. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. One week, right? To check the results. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. And for not laughing at me for worrying so much. My wife always says I’m a hypochondriac. I guess we’ll see what the tests say. Thank you again. I should probably get going before traffic gets too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia. And try to rest those legs.
