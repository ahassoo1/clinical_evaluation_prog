DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hello Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes. Well, it’s this… clearance thing. For the… performance. It’s a physical, right? They said I needed one. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details. It's been a long time since I… did anything like this. Is it going to take long?
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Osterholm. And yes, it is a physical. It sounds like your employer requires one for… continued performance. Don't worry, we'll get through it. It shouldn't be too bad, but it’s necessary to ensure you’re fit for whatever it is you do. Now, you said you don't remember all the details… that’s alright. We’ll cover everything. But to start, can you tell me a little about what kind of performance requires this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… I… usher, I think? Or maybe ticket taker? Sometimes I help in the lobby. It’s at the theater, you see. The old Grand Majestic. I’ve been doing it… a long, long time. It's mostly just… standing, walking around, showing people to their seats. Very little strenuous activity, if that makes sense. I mostly just want to get this over with, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, the Grand Majestic. I’ve heard of it. So, mostly light activity… standing, walking. Okay. And has anything changed recently that prompted this physical?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Well, my knees… they ache a bit more than they used to. And I get winded easier, going up the stairs, but… that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing new, per se. Just… the usual wear and tear.
DOCTOR: Knees aching more, getting winded easier… alright. We'll definitely take a look at those knees. And the shortness of breath is worth checking out, regardless of age. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all – like diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure…?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. Honestly, Doctor, it's been so long, and I don’t really go to doctors. I haven't been seriously ill in… well, decades, probably. I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. But nothing… diagnosed, no. I don’t think so. My ex-wife, she always handled all that paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no known diagnoses. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia repaired once? But again, that was ages and ages ago. My ex-wife would know for sure, she kept all those records. I’m really not much help, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re doing fine, Mr. Krahn. It’s alright that you don’t remember everything. We’ll just do our best. Okay, tonsils as a child and a hernia repair… noted. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh. Well, my parents are… gone now, both of them. I had a sister, but we haven’t spoken in years. Not a friendly parting, I'm afraid. And… I was divorced. No children. So, no one really to ask about family history, I suppose. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No significant family medical history to speak of. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Never really needed any. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be safe, but that's it. Nothing regular. I prefer to… just get on with things, you see. Don’t like relying on pills and potions.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies – to foods, medications, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. Bees sting everyone, don’t they? And it just hurts for a little while. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Is that it? Are we done with the questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. That’s all the preliminary questions for now. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… fine. Just get it over with, please. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. Please lie back and relax. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. I’ll listen to your lungs… Lung sounds are clear. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Please bend your knees for me… There’s some crepitus and tenderness on both knees, consistent with osteoarthritis. Range of motion is slightly limited. I can also feel some swelling. Alright, Mr. Krahn, that's all for the physical exam. .
