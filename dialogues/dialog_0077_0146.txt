DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s… lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… muscle weakness, really. It’s been getting worse the last few weeks, and figured I should get it checked out before it gets any worse. Don’t really have the time for this, to be honest, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Muscle weakness… alright. And when you say “getting worse,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. It started with just feeling a little tired after work, you know? Like, normal tired. But now… it's like lifting things is harder. Even just getting up from the couch takes effort. And my hands… they feel weak sometimes, like I might drop something. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I think. Not really in my face, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began gradually with fatigue, now progressing to difficulty with lifting and getting up… primarily in the arms and legs. And no facial weakness. That's helpful. Now, has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a little more clumsy than usual, I guess. Dropped my phone a couple times. And… I don't know if this is related, but I’ve been feeling… off. Just a general unwell feeling. Hard to explain. Not sick, exactly. Just… not right. No fever or anything.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness and a general feeling of being unwell… alright. Could you describe this "unwell" feeling a little more?
PATIENT: It's like… a heaviness, mostly. In my chest, sometimes. And I've been more tired during the day, even if I sleep okay. Not like a crash, just… sluggish. I've also been a little bit… forgetful? But I'm always a little forgetful, so it’s hard to tell if it’s worse. Like, I walked in here and forgot where I parked… but I always do that. It's frustrating. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright… heaviness in the chest, increased daytime fatigue, and some forgetfulness. Now, Mr. McKinnon, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing diagnosed, anyway. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, that kind of thing. But nothing ongoing. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing. That I know of, anyway. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: No known medical conditions. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Not even tonsils out. I’m lucky, I guess. Don't like hospitals. Waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My dad had some heart trouble when he was older, needed a stent or something. And my mom… she had arthritis, bad joints. That's about it, really. Nobody with anything… weird. No muscle diseases or anything like that. Just… old age stuff, mostly.
DOCTOR: Heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother. Now, Mr. McKinnon, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Always been able to. Don't take much medicine though, like I said. I avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: No allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not even vitamins. I don't really believe in all that stuff. Waste of money. I eat okay, I guess. Not great, but okay. Don't need supplements.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let's get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go. Just… try to be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just sit here, we'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 90. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds… normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… slightly diminished in your arms and legs. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It's… not as strong as it used to be, I guess. I noticed that myself. Just feels weaker, overall. It’s frustrating, honestly. I need my hands for work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Your grip strength is reduced bilaterally. And can you try to push against my hands?
PATIENT: There. It feels… harder than it should be. Like I'm trying to push through mud or something. It's not a sharp pain, just… effort. It's annoying. Honestly. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reduced grip strength, and some difficulty with resistance to force. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your arms and legs. Range of motion appears full, but you do report some mild discomfort with extension… in both arms. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. See? It's just… not smooth. I feel a little wobbly, like I might fall. Not a big deal, just feels… off. I haven't fallen yet, but I could see it happening. Honestly. It's frustrating, because I used to be steady as a rock.
DOCTOR: I see. There is a slight unsteadiness to your gait. Alright, Mr. McKinnon, thank you. That's enough for a quick examination. Now, based on your symptoms and this brief examination, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your muscle weakness, fatigue, clumsiness, and unsteady gait are concerning. Given your age and the progressive nature of these symptoms, we need to rule out several potential causes.
PATIENT: Potential causes? Honestly. What kind of causes? Is this something serious? I've got a job, you know? I can’t be sick. What do you think it is? Just tell me straight. I haven’t got time for beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I understand your concern. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. However, we need to consider possibilities like vitamin deficiencies, nerve problems, or, less commonly, muscle disorders. A more concerning, though less likely possibility, could be something affecting the nervous system. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation or muscle damage. Additionally, I'd like to order an electromyography, or EMG, which will assess the electrical activity of your muscles. This will help us determine if there is a problem with the nerves or muscles themselves. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Honestly. More tests. Vitamin deficiencies, nerve problems… it sounds complicated. EMG… sounds expensive. What’s the point of all this if it just means more time and money wasted? Look, can’t you just tell me what I need to do? A pill? Rest? Honestly. Is it something I can fix myself? I’m not good with all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I understand your frustration. It is complicated, and I apologize that I don’t have a simple answer for you right now. However, it’s important to be thorough to get the correct diagnosis. I want to avoid guessing and ensure we find the best course of treatment. The blood work is relatively inexpensive, and will help us rule out some of the simpler possibilities. The EMG is more costly, but will provide valuable information if the blood work is inconclusive. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. We can discuss options for pain management if needed. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local laboratories where you can get the blood work done?
PATIENT: Fine. List of labs. Just get it over with. The sooner I know something, the sooner I can go back to work. Honestly. I don’t have time for this. And… can you just write down what those words mean? Vitamin deficiencies, EMG… I want to know what I’m paying for. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a list of labs near you. And here is a sheet explaining the terms “vitamin deficiencies” and “electromyography,” and what they involve. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results, to discuss them in detail and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as increased weakness, difficulty breathing, or loss of sensation, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that's it. Just… don’t call me with bad news. Honestly. I've got things to do. Thanks… I guess. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. McKinnon. Take care. .
