DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But after I eat fava beans… I just feel awful. And I get really yellow. My skin, my eyes… everything. It started a few weeks ago, and it’s happening every time now. It’s… hemolytic anemia, I think the other doctor said? After the fava beans, that is.
DOCTOR: Hemolytic anemia… yes. And this is consistently after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Every time. It doesn't matter how many I eat, even just a handful. And it always starts within a few hours, I’d say. I used to love them, actually. We had them a lot growing up, but now… I’m scared to eat anything. I haven’t had them for about a week now, and I'm feeling a bit better, but still tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, work's been the same, stressful as always, but that's normal. I haven't been traveling, no new medications… I did start a new vitamin D supplement, but that was maybe a month ago, before all this started with the beans. Just trying to get enough sunshine, you know? It's been cloudy. I don’t think that’s it, though. It seems too… specific, with the beans.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D… alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tough one. My parents are both gone now, and I didn’t really talk about health much with them. My mother was… just generally unwell a lot, always tired. I don’t know if it was anything specific. My father was pretty healthy, I think. No one ever mentioned anything like this happening to anyone else, but honestly, I don’t know much about their side of the family. We weren't very close to relatives. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s something. We’ll proceed. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I’m a little nervous, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your sclera – the whites of your eyes. Hmm. Yes, there is a slight jaundice present, as you mentioned. And your skin tone is noticeably pale. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Palpating your abdomen… no tenderness, no enlargement. Let me check your spleen. It’s… slightly enlarged. Not dramatically, but noticeable.
PATIENT: Slightly enlarged… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean, doctor? Is it serious? I haven’t felt any pain, but… well, I guess that doesn’t mean much. Could it be the anemia? Or… something else? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It could be related to the anemia, yes. However, splenomegaly – that is, an enlarged spleen – can have multiple causes. Given your history of consuming fava beans and subsequent jaundice, and the finding of splenomegaly, the most likely diagnosis at this point is Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency – G6PD deficiency, for short. It’s a genetic condition that makes you susceptible to hemolytic anemia when exposed to certain triggers, like fava beans. We’ll need to confirm with a blood test, of course. But avoiding fava beans and other triggers is the first step.
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency… I’ve never heard of that. Genetic? So… I was born with this? And fava beans are the trigger? Is there… a cure? Or treatment? Will I be sick forever if I accidentally eat one? And what other triggers are there? I eat a lot of different things, I don’t want to have to worry about everything I put in my mouth. This is… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a genetic condition. You inherit it from your parents. There isn’t a cure, no. Treatment is primarily avoiding triggers. Fava beans are the most common, and often the most significant. However, certain medications can also trigger a reaction – some antibiotics, antimalarials, and even some pain relievers. We'll get you a complete list. As for accidentally eating one… it depends on the amount, of course. A small amount might cause a mild reaction, but a larger amount could be more severe. We’ll order a G6PD enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis. Also, a complete blood count and reticulocyte count to assess the severity of the anemia. Avoid fava beans completely until we get the results. I’m ordering the tests now. You should receive a call to schedule them. Come back when the results are available, we'll discuss treatment and management then. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s everything for now. A list of medications… that’s good. I’ll definitely avoid the beans. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. A genetic condition I didn’t even know I had… Thank you, doctor. For explaining everything, and for ordering the tests. I appreciate it. I’ll wait for the call to schedule them. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You’ll receive a call. Avoid the beans. That is all. .
