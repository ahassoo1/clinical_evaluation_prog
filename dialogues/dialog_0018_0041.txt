DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… this getting weaker, you see. It’s been happening slowly, but it's making things harder. I think my wife, Leilani, explained it when we made the appointment. She’s good with the… with the details. I just feel… tired, and my legs don’t work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see a note from Leilani regarding increasing weakness. Thank you for clarifying. It’s very helpful to hear it directly from you as well, Mr. Astores. When you say "slowly," could you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… Slowly… maybe six months now? It started with just feeling a little clumsy, you know? Like I had to think more about walking. Now… now it’s harder to get up from the chair, and walking even short distances makes me tired. It’s not sudden, like a fall or anything. Just… less strength. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make perfect sense, Mr. Astores. A gradual onset over six months is important information. And you mentioned it’s affecting your legs primarily?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly my legs. But sometimes my hands feel… numb, or clumsy too. Not all the time, but it happens. And… and my vision gets blurry sometimes. It doesn’t last long, but it worries me. It feels like… everything is just a little bit harder than it used to be, all over. I don’t know if that’s just getting old, though. I’m 83 now, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're sharing all of this with me, Mr. Astores. It’s important to consider everything, and age certainly plays a role, but we need to investigate to understand what’s happening. You mentioned numbness and clumsiness in your hands, and blurry vision. Does anything specific seem to trigger these symptoms, or do they come on randomly?
PATIENT: That’s… that’s a good question. Hmm… I don’t think anything specific triggers it. It just… happens. Sometimes after I've been walking for a bit, but not always. And the blurry vision… that seems to come and go randomly too. It's not like it happens every time I stand up or anything. I haven't noticed a pattern, no. Leilani might have noticed something I haven’t, she’s very observant. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astores. It’s often difficult to pinpoint triggers, and Leilani's observations are very valuable. Now, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have a little bit of trouble with my heart, the doctor told me. Nothing too serious, he said. I take a little pill for it every morning. And my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but I’m watching what I eat, and it’s usually okay. Other than that… no, not really. I used to be very active, you know? Played football in my younger days. But that was a long time ago. I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astores. That’s helpful. Medicare is good to know. And yes, a history of heart trouble is important. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. Leilani handles all the pills, you see. I just take them. It’s a small white one, I think. Maybe… maybe Lisinopril? Is that right? Or something like that. I’m sorry, Doctor. I really don't know the names. She'll know, for sure. I'm terrible with remembering those things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Astores. Many patients find medication names difficult to remember. We can easily verify this with Leilani or your pharmacy records. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago. And… and I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my leg playing football. It was a bad break, needed a cast. Other than that, no. Nothing serious. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Just this… this weakness is worrying me now. It’s different than anything I’ve been through before.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And you mentioned this weakness feels different than previous injuries. Can you describe what makes it different?
PATIENT: It’s not… pain, you see? The broken leg, that hurt terribly. This… this is just… tiring. And it comes and goes. Some days are better than others, but it’s always there, lurking in the background. It’s like my body is… heavier than it used to be. And sometimes, like when I try to walk, it feels like my legs aren’t… listening to me. Like they don’t want to move. It's hard to explain. It’s just… not a pain, it’s a… lack of strength, and it feels… strange. Like something is wrong inside, not just on the surface.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astores. That’s a very helpful description. It sounds like a progressive weakness, not associated with pain, which is important. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother, she had… trouble with her memory when she got older. Not Alzheimer’s, I don’t think, but she started forgetting things. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. He didn't take care of himself, always eating sweets. Other than that… not that I know of. My wife might know more, she remembers things better than I do. We don’t talk about it much, to be honest. It’s not something we dwell on.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’m married, as I mentioned. Leilani and I have been married for… oh, goodness, almost 60 years now! We have five children, all grown up with families of their own. I used to work as an athletic trainer, helping the football team at the local high school. I loved that job. Now, I mostly stay home and take things easy. We go to church on Sundays, and I enjoy watching football on TV. I don't drink or smoke. Mostly just try to enjoy life, you know? It’s a good life, a simple life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Astores. A good life indeed. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I’ll check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your strength, reflexes, and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, you know, things don’t move quite as smoothly as they used to! But I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll take things slowly and gently. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 148/85, and your pulse is 72 beats per minute. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Could you please extend your arms like this?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Like this, Doctor? It feels a little… tight. I haven't stretched much lately, you know. I hope my arms aren't too weak. I used to be strong as an ox. Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable. But go ahead, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your strength in your arms is slightly reduced, but still adequate. Now, let's move on to your legs. Could you please extend one leg at a time?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. There… that’s a little harder. It feels… tighter than my arms. And it's a little bit wobbly, you know? Not strong like it used to be. I can feel that weakness now, when you ask me to do things. Is that bad, Doctor? Is it as bad as I think it is?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes in your legs are also diminished. Strength is noticeably reduced in both legs, particularly when resisting my pressure. I also noticed some mild instability when you extended your legs. Mr. Astores, based on this initial examination, there is evidence of weakness in your legs, along with reduced reflexes and some instability. This, combined with your symptoms of fatigue and gradual onset of weakness, warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I recommend a few tests. We should start with a Complete Blood Count to check for any underlying infection or anemia, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a Vitamin D level. I also think an MRI of your lumbar spine would be beneficial to rule out any spinal compression. Finally, I’d like to order a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation of your muscle strength and reflexes. Do that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds… reasonable. Anything to find out what’s going on. I just want to know what’s happening to me, you know? I don't like feeling like I'm falling apart. MRI… that sounds… complicated. And a neurologist… is that someone who specializes in… in the brain and nerves? Is it something serious, Doctor? Is it… is it something I should be really worried about? I hope it’s not… not one of those things you can’t fix.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astores. It’s natural to feel anxious when faced with the unknown. Let me assure you, we are taking this very seriously and want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. The tests I’ve recommended will help us narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. Yes, a neurologist specializes in the brain and nervous system. They are the best equipped to evaluate your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. It’s important to remember that these tests don’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. There are many possible causes of weakness, and we need to gather more information before we can make a diagnosis. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more complex. To be honest, Mr. Astores, there are a number of possibilities we need to explore. The tests will help us rule some things in and some things out. I don't want to jump to any conclusions before we have all the information. I’ll order these tests for you now, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest and avoid any strenuous activities. Is there anything specific that makes your weakness worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… strenuous activities… yes, that definitely makes it worse. Walking long distances, climbing stairs… those are hard now. And sometimes, like on a hot day, it feels… heavier. Like my legs are made of lead. And I noticed… I noticed it’s worse when I’m tired. If I don’t get enough sleep, I can barely get out of the chair. It’s just… frustrating, you know? I used to be so active. I could walk for miles without even thinking about it. Now… now I have to plan everything around my legs. I hope we can figure out what’s going on, Doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astores. It’s incredibly frustrating when your body limits your ability to do the things you enjoy. That’s exactly why we’re doing these tests – to find a solution and get you back to feeling like yourself again. Okay, so we’ve established that strenuous activity, heat, and fatigue worsen your symptoms. That’s valuable information. I'm going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin with Vitamin D to see if that helps improve your energy levels. I’ll also give you a referral to the neurologist, Dr. Kawamura, and her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They are excellent and will conduct a thorough evaluation. Before we finish, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication before. Leilani would know if I did, she’s very careful about those things. She keeps track of everything. I just take the pills she gives me, I don't ask too many questions. She’s a good woman, that Leilani. I don’t know what I’d do without her. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. It’s my pleasure. And it sounds like you have a wonderful partner in Leilani. Having someone to support you through this is invaluable. Okay, so no known allergies. I'll also send a summary of our conversation and the test orders to your primary care physician, so they are aware of what's going on. Here are your prescriptions and the referral to Dr. Kawamura. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the test results are available. In the meantime, please take care of yourself, get plenty of rest, and avoid overexerting yourself. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered all my questions, Doctor. Just… just try to find out what’s going on, okay? I want to feel like myself again. I want to be able to walk with Leilani without having to stop every few minutes. That’s all I ask. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Astores. That’s exactly what we’re going to do. We'll do everything we can to help you get back to feeling your best. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
