DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I have been having trouble breathing. It makes a whistling sound when I try to take a deep breath. It’s been happening for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A whistling sound, you say. And for a few days now. Can you describe the whistling sound a little more?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… how to say? Like a small bird, maybe? When I walk up the stairs, it is worse. And sometimes at night, it wakes me up. Not every night, but some nights. I try to take a big breath, and wheeze… that sound.
DOCTOR: Okay, a whistling sound, worse with exertion – like walking upstairs – and occurring intermittently at night. And it interrupts your breath. Do you feel any chest tightness or pain when this happens, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not pain. It feels… tight, yes, but not painful. Like someone is squeezing, but not hard. Just… uncomfortable. And makes me feel… tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think. My grandson, he came to visit last week. He has a little cold, maybe? I held him a lot, played with him. Could that be it? And the weather has been very warm, very humid. I don’t like the humidity.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandson with a cold and the humid weather. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a little tired, like I said. And maybe a little bit of a cough, but not much. It is a dry cough, not bringing anything up. Just… tickles my throat.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been very healthy all my life, until… well, until this. My mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but I have never had problems with my lungs. I used to walk a lot, you know? Very active.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of asthma or lung problems. Mother with heart issues. And you were previously very active. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that is all. Just a cast. Nothing serious. I have always been careful, you know? Try to avoid accidents.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my joints are sore, I take something for that. But nothing for my lungs, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medicines.
DOCTOR: Okay. Multivitamins and occasional medication for joint pain. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I have never had a reaction to anything. Flowers, food… nothing bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Kilton, I think it’s time to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Please. I would like to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just have a seat here, please. And I’ll need you to take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will try my best. It is sometimes hard to take a deep breath, you know, with the… whistling.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath… and again… and one more. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lungs, Mrs. Kilton. It's more prominent on exhale. Your breathing rate is slightly elevated, but your oxygen saturation is good at 96%. Your chest is clear to percussion. Now, I'd like to check your pulse and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That is what I thought. The whistling. I am glad you heard it. My pulse and blood pressure are fine, I think? I feel okay, besides the… breathing.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is 78 and blood pressure is 130/80, which are within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild exacerbation of reactive airway disease – possibly bronchitis, or early-stage asthma. The grandson’s cold likely introduced a virus. It’s not an emergency at this moment, but it needs to be addressed. Do you smoke, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I do not smoke. My husband, he used to smoke, but he stopped many years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health. And for everyone around him.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright. I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways. It's a rescue inhaler, you'll use it as needed when you feel short of breath or wheezing. I will also prescribe a short course of oral steroids to reduce inflammation. We’ll start with these. It’s important to use the inhaler correctly, so the nurse will demonstrate the proper technique before you leave. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A bronchodilator? And steroids? Will those… make me feel sick? I do not like taking many medicines.
DOCTOR: The bronchodilator simply opens your airways, allowing you to breathe easier. It has minimal side effects for most people. The steroids are a short course, and while they can have side effects, the benefits outweigh the risks in your case – it’s to reduce the swelling in your airways. I assure you, it’s not a large dose, and it’s only for a few days. It's important to take them as prescribed. We'll monitor your condition, and adjust the treatment if needed. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so, Doctor. A little bit of medicine to help me breathe. And it won't be for very long. But I do not want to feel… strange. Or weak.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, I understand your concerns. It’s perfectly reasonable to be cautious about medications. But, frankly, uncontrolled breathing issues are far more detrimental to your health. The small risk of mild side effects from these medications is significantly less than the risk of developing pneumonia or other complications if this goes untreated. I’m also going to prescribe you a peak flow meter. The nurse will show you how to use it to monitor your lung function at home. If your peak flow drops below a certain level, it will indicate you need to use the inhaler. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. Do you have any further questions before I call the nurse?
PATIENT: A peak flow meter? That sounds… complicated. I am not very good with machines, Doctor. And pneumonia… oh dear. I just want to breathe normally again. Will the inhaler help right away? And… what are the side effects? You said there were some.
DOCTOR: The inhaler should provide relief within a few minutes. As for the peak flow meter, it’s quite simple, really. The nurse will demonstrate it – it just measures how forcefully you can exhale. It’s a way to track your lung function objectively. The potential side effects of the inhaler are minimal – maybe a slightly increased heart rate or some mild shakiness, but these are uncommon and usually resolve quickly. The oral steroids can cause some temporary insomnia or increased appetite, but again, these are typically mild and short-lived. I’m prescribing you the lowest effective dose to minimize these risks. Now, let's get the nurse in here to explain everything in detail. Do you have any allergies to any medications, just to be absolutely certain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have never had a reaction to any medicine before. But… I am still a little bit scared, you know? I just want to be careful. And I hope the nurse is very patient with me. The machine… I am not good with machines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. I understand your apprehension. The nurse is excellent, and she will be more than happy to walk you through everything step-by-step, as many times as needed. I’ll just let her know to be extra patient with the peak flow meter demonstration. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. The nurse will be in shortly. Follow her instructions carefully, and don't hesitate to ask questions. We'll get you breathing normally again.
PATIENT: .
