DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Chagaris. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been having some… well, some pressure in my bladder. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marialena. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Pressure in the bladder can be caused by a number of things, so let's try to understand what might be going on with you. To start, could you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Of course. It’s… it’s a consistent feeling, not really sharp pain, more like a fullness, even when I haven’t just had anything to drink. It makes me feel like I need to go to the bathroom quite often, even if there’s not much to go. It’s… a little disruptive, honestly. It’s been happening for about two weeks, maybe a little longer. I can recall the exact date it started, it was the 18th of July.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detail, Marialena. Knowing the start date is very helpful. So, a consistent feeling of fullness, even with minimal intake, and increased frequency… and you mentioned this has been going on since July 18th. Is this constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. It does seem a little worse in the evenings, though. Like, if I’ve been sitting for a while, or if I’ve had even a small amount of caffeine, it becomes more noticeable. I do enjoy my afternoon tea, perhaps that is contributing. It isn't debilitating, but it's definitely… present. I can recall a slight increase in frequency after having tea.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Marialena. The correlation with sitting and caffeine intake is useful. And it's good to know it isn't debilitating, but consistently present. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this bladder pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No pain when I do go to the bathroom, no fever, no blood in my urine… nothing like that. I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, but I attributed that to work being quite busy. I can recall that my energy levels have decreased over the last month, though I didn't immediately connect it to this issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, fever, or blood in the urine. Increased fatigue, which you've linked to work, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I do have some mild seasonal allergies, but that’s about it. I’ve been fortunate. I do have Medicare, and I've had a routine checkup last year, in May, and everything was normal then, as I recall. My husband keeps track of these things, and I can ask him for the exact details if you’d like.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Marialena. Seasonal allergies are helpful to know, and a normal checkup last year is reassuring. No need to bother your husband right now, unless you'd like to. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve never had any surgeries, and I’ve never been hospitalized. I’ve been very lucky in that regard as well. I do have a bit of anxiety about hospitals, so that’s definitely a plus. I can recall not having even a single overnight stay. I've always been able to avoid those situations, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Marialena. No surgeries or hospitalizations is very good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Of course. My mother had high blood pressure, as I recall, and my father had some issues with cholesterol. Nothing major, as far as I know. No history of bladder problems or kidney issues on either side of the family, as far as I'm aware. My maternal grandmother did have diabetes, but that was later in life. I can recall my mother mentioning it often when I was growing up. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. That's helpful. No bladder or kidney issues is good to know. High blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes are all relevant. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never smoked, and I don’t use any tobacco products at all. My husband smokes occasionally, but I don’t. I’m quite sensitive to the smell, actually. I can recall disliking the smell even as a child.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I drink very occasionally, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. Nothing regular, and I wouldn’t say I drink heavily at all. Maybe once or twice a month. I can recall having a glass of wine at my anniversary last week, and another the week before with friends.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Marialena. Very occasional alcohol consumption is not a concern. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. And it’s not often, perhaps once or twice a year. I prefer to manage things naturally if I can, and I try to stay hydrated. I can recall using ibuprofen last in February when I had a particularly bad migraine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marialena. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a brief neurological check. This will help me assess your situation further. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I’m comfortable with that. Please proceed. I trust your judgment and want to do whatever I can to help figure out what’s going on. I can recall being a bit nervous about exams in the past, but I feel quite comfortable here.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, your bowel sounds are normal. Now I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. Alright, a little discomfort with deep palpation in the lower abdomen, but nothing significant. Now, I'm just going to do a quick neurological assessment. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Okay, everything appears normal neurologically. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a urinary frequency and urgency issue, possibly related to bladder irritation. Given the mild discomfort with palpation, we'll need to rule out a urinary tract infection and assess for other possible causes. I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to start. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A urinalysis and urine culture seem like a good next step. I'm happy to do whatever you recommend. I can recall reading about urinary tract infections, and it makes sense to rule that out. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. What is the next step after the tests are completed?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the nurse draw a sample for those tests right away. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. If the tests reveal a UTI, we’ll start you on antibiotics. If the tests are negative, we may consider other possibilities, such as overactive bladder syndrome or interstitial cystitis. In that case, we might discuss lifestyle modifications, such as reducing caffeine intake, timed voiding, or bladder training exercises. In rare cases, we may consider referral to a urologist for further evaluation. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds very clear and comprehensive. Thank you for laying out the possibilities so thoroughly. I understand that we need to rule out an infection first, and then we can proceed with other investigations if necessary. I can recall the nurse mentioning a clean-catch sample, is that what’s needed? And about how long will the appointment take after the results are available? I have some work commitments to schedule around.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. The nurse will provide you with instructions for a clean-catch urine sample. It's important to follow those instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. As for follow-up, once the results are available – usually within 48-72 hours – we can schedule a brief phone consultation, or a follow-up appointment, whichever you prefer. The consultation will likely take about 15-20 minutes to discuss the results and any necessary next steps. We can coordinate a time that works best with your work schedule. Would you prefer a phone call or an in-person appointment for the follow-up?
PATIENT: A phone call would be perfectly fine, Doctor. That would be much more convenient with my work commitments. Thank you for being so accommodating. I can recall having a busy schedule lately, so this is greatly appreciated. I’ll wait to hear from the nurse about the urine sample instructions. Do I need to do anything else at this point?
DOCTOR: No, Marialena, you don't need to do anything else at this point. Just wait to hear from the nurse regarding the urine sample instructions. In the meantime, I’ll document everything we discussed today in your electronic health record. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine. Thank you for coming in today. I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly and get you feeling better soon. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is everything. Thank you so much for your time and thoroughness. I feel much more reassured after speaking with you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and being so understanding. I can recall feeling quite anxious before this appointment, and you’ve put my mind at ease. I will contact the clinic if anything changes. Have a wonderful day! .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It’s my pleasure to help. You have a wonderful day as well. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
