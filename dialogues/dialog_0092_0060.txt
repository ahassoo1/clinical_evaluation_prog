DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Thanks. Well, it's… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble, you know? And cancer. Not a great track record. I’m probably being silly, but I just want to make sure I'm okay. Get some tests done, I guess. Just… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Theriot. It's certainly not silly to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart trouble and cancer. It's good you're thinking ahead. To get a better picture of things, let's talk a little more about this family history. Could you tell me specifically which relatives have had heart trouble and cancer, and if you know at what age they were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. My maternal grandmother, she had… something with her heart, I think it was a valve? She was probably in her late 70s when that happened. Then my aunt – my mom’s sister – she got breast cancer about five years ago. She was… early 60s, I think. And my uncle, on the same side, he had lung cancer, but he smoked, so… you know. He wasn’t very smart. He was maybe… 65 when he found out. It was bad. Really bad. I don’t really want to dwell on that one.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Theriot. That’s a lot to process, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t want to dwell on difficult memories. So, grandmother with a valve issue in her late 70s, aunt with breast cancer in her early 60s, and uncle with lung cancer, a smoker, diagnosed around 65. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about you – have you experienced any symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that. I’ve been… pretty good, actually. I exercise regularly – mostly running – and I try to eat healthy, though sometimes it’s hard. I do get tired easily, but I just figured it’s from work. I’m a teacher, you know? It’s exhausting dealing with… well, never mind. But no, no chest pain or anything worrying like that. It's more just…prevention, I suppose. I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear you're prioritizing your health with exercise and a good diet, Mr. Theriot. Being a teacher is incredibly demanding work – don’t downplay that at all! Now, let's go through a quick review of systems, just to cover all bases. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, any skin changes, or any unusual bleeding or bruising?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… no, pretty regular, thankfully. Skin… no, nothing unusual. I get a little sunburned easily, being fair-skinned, but that’s about it. Bleeding or bruising… no. I cut myself shaving sometimes, but nothing major. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting your time. I’m perfectly healthy. I just… I worry. My wife… ex-wife, actually… she used to tell me I was a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: You’re not wasting my time at all, Mr. Theriot. It’s much better to address your concerns now than to ignore them. And it’s perfectly normal to worry, especially given your family history. Now, regarding your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that’s it. I get a yearly physical with my primary care doctor, and everything’s always been… fine. Blood pressure is always a little high at the doctor's office, but he says it's just white coat syndrome. I take no medications, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Tonsils out as a child, otherwise healthy, yearly physicals with normal results, and a tendency for slightly elevated blood pressure at the doctor's office, attributed to white coat syndrome. No current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes in the spring, but I don’t think that’s an allergy, just… pollen, you know? Nothing I need to carry an EpiPen for or anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, either. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I just… I keep waiting for something to go wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family’s history beyond your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Um… my father’s side is… less eventful, I suppose. He had a sister who had arthritis, but that’s about it. My dad himself was pretty healthy until the end. Heart attack, about five years ago. But he was a smoker, too. And he didn’t really take care of himself. So… not a great example, either. He wasn't a very good man, honestly. But that's another story.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like there’s a pattern of heart issues on both sides of your family, and unfortunately, lifestyle factors may have played a role. Now, before we proceed with any testing, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know I'm okay. Or, you know, what I need to do to be okay. It’s just… everything feels so fragile, you know? My ex-wife always said I worried too much. Maybe she was right. But it's hard not to, with everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious, especially given your family history and your concerns. We'll do everything we can to assess your health and address any potential issues. If you'd like, you can go ahead and get comfortable on the exam table. We'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. It's good that it came down with repeated measurements. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart rhythm is regular, and your lungs sound clear. I don't detect any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Now, I'll just do a quick visual assessment… Everything looks good so far, Mr. Theriot. However, given your family history, I recommend we run some blood tests to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. These tests will include a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything to be sure. Blood tests are fine. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. I know you have other patients, and… well. It’s just… I just want to know what I’m facing. If anything.
DOCTOR: You are not a burden at all, Mr. Theriot. Your health is my priority, and I’m happy to address your concerns. Excellent. I will order the blood tests now. You can have them drawn at the lab just down the hall. They’ll need a fasting sample, so that means no eating or drinking anything except water for at least eight hours beforehand. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Eight hours. I can do that. I usually skip breakfast anyway. It’s just… the waiting, I suppose. Waiting for the results. That's the hardest part. My ex-wife used to say I worried too much about things I couldn't control. She was probably right.
DOCTOR: Waiting is the hardest part, Mr. Theriot. I understand. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, usually within a few days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, it's important to continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle – regular exercise, a balanced diet, and getting enough sleep. Also, if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or unexplained weight loss, please don't hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very patient. I appreciate it. It's just… nice to feel like someone is listening. Maybe I'm just overthinking everything. But it's hard not to, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. It’s my pleasure. And you’re not overthinking anything at all. It’s perfectly reasonable to be proactive about your health, especially given your concerns. We'll get those tests done, and we'll figure things out together. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a copy of the lab requisition form. The lab technician will need this when you go for your blood draw. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
