DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. But after I eat fava beans, I get really sick. My skin turns yellow, and I just feel… awful. Like I have no energy at all. It started a few months ago, and it’s happened every time I’ve had them since.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve noticed this every time you consume fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, every time. It doesn’t matter how many I eat, even just a small handful will do it. It usually starts within a few hours, and lasts… a couple of days, maybe? It’s really draining. I just thought it was something I was sensitive to, but then a friend suggested it could be something more serious.
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a strong word, Ms. Haggar. But it’s certainly worth investigating. Your skin turning yellow is… noteworthy. Can you describe the “awful” feeling more precisely?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to explain. I just feel… weak, mostly. Very tired, like I haven't slept in days, even when I have. And a little dizzy sometimes. My stomach feels a bit off too, not exactly nauseous, but uncomfortable. And… I guess a bit achy all over, like a mild flu. It’s just a really unpleasant feeling, overall. I don’t feel like doing anything.
DOCTOR: Weakness, fatigue, dizziness, some stomach discomfort and generalised aches… and all coinciding with fava bean ingestion. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really paid that much attention, honestly. Now that you ask… my pee has been a bit darker than usual, almost brownish sometimes. And I think… maybe my heart has been beating a little faster than normal? But I’m not sure if that’s just me being anxious about feeling sick. It’s hard to tell. I’m not usually one to notice those things.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and a faster heartbeat… that is more concerning, Ms. Haggar. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I take a daily multivitamin, that's it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. This whole thing is very strange. It’s just… the beans. It’s always after the beans. And it’s not like I eat them often, maybe a few times a year when I find them at the market.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to do a bit of investigating, Ms. Haggar. It sounds as though you may have something called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where individuals lack an enzyme needed to properly process fava beans, causing a reaction. We’ll need to run some blood tests to confirm this, of course. Before that, though, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Nothing at all. I've been lucky, really. No serious illnesses, no surgeries… just the usual colds and flu throughout the years. I don’t even take any prescription medications, aside from the occasional pain reliever for a headache. I’m generally very healthy, like I said. This is all so… unexpected. What exactly happens with Favism? Is it dangerous?
DOCTOR: Well, it's not common, thankfully. Essentially, the lack of that enzyme leads to a breakdown of red blood cells after fava bean consumption. That’s why you’re feeling weak and tired - it’s anaemia. The dark urine is from the breakdown products being processed by your kidneys. As for dangerous… it can be, depending on the severity of the reaction. Severe cases require hospitalization and even blood transfusions. However, mild cases, like yours sounds, can be managed by simply avoiding fava beans. That is, if it is Favism. Let's move onto your family history, Ms. Haggar. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That sounds… scary. Hospitalisation? Oh dear. As for family history… my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, really. He lived to be 90. On my mother’s side, there was an aunt who had something with her stomach, but I don’t know what it was, and it was a long time ago. Nothing really significant that I know of. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about medical things, honestly. I don’t think anyone else had anything serious. It's all very… normal on both sides, I think. Mostly just old age illnesses.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And what about your social history, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Do you want to know about my job? Or… what? I’m a receptionist at a doctor’s office, actually. Irony, isn’t it? I’m single, live alone… not much to tell, really. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. I enjoy gardening and reading. Is that what you’re looking for? I’m not sure what’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Just standard procedure, Ms. Haggar. We need to establish a complete picture. It’s important to know about lifestyle factors. Alright. And finally, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Then we’ll get those blood tests ordered. If you'll just lie down for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Sure, no problem. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, so it’s probably a good idea to check everything over anyway. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a bit nervous, if you don’t mind me saying. This whole thing is very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, as expected given your description. Lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is slightly tender to palpation here. No significant masses or organomegaly. Alright, Ms. Haggar, based on your symptoms and preliminary exam, Favism is a strong possibility. However, we need those blood tests to confirm it. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. The G6PD assay is the key one – it will tell us if you have a deficiency in that enzyme. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: That’s a lot of words! But… okay. So the G6PD… that’s the one that will tell us if I’m… deficient? And if I am deficient, does that mean I just have to avoid fava beans forever? What about other foods? Is there anything else I should be careful about? I just… I’m starting to worry a little. It sounds complicated. And what if it’s not Favism? What else could it be?
DOCTOR: Yes, the G6PD assay is the key. If it’s low, it confirms the diagnosis. And yes, if it is Favism, avoidance of fava beans is the primary management. There are some other foods and medications that can also trigger a reaction, but we’ll discuss those if the diagnosis is confirmed. It's important not to self-restrict unnecessarily at this stage. As for what else it could be… there are other causes of haemolytic anaemia, but they are less likely given your clear link to fava bean ingestion. We’ll investigate further if the G6PD assay is normal. I'm going to order the blood tests now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It should take a couple of days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any foods that contain them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Avoid the beans, wait for the results. I think so, yes. It's just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But I appreciate you explaining it all. I’ll make sure to avoid the beans and wait for the lab to call. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Like, if I start to feel worse, or… anything specific? I’m just trying to be prepared. And thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I’m not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. As for symptoms to watch out for, if you experience any of the following – unusual fatigue, shortness of breath, dark urine, jaundice , or abdominal pain – contact me immediately. Those are signs that a haemolytic reaction is occurring. We will proceed systematically. Let's get those results first. I'll send the results to your primary care physician as well. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I think you’ve answered everything. I’ll wait for the lab to call and avoid the beans. Thank you again, Doctor Press. I appreciate your help. I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Haggar. You’re welcome. Please contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
