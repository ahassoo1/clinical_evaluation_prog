DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It’s been… annoying, to be honest. Not painful, exactly, just… like pins and needles. I just want to figure out what's going on with it, if you can. I haven't got a lot of time, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, tingling… pins and needles. I understand you’re short on time, and we'll do our best to be efficient. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about when this tingling started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started… oh, maybe a couple of months ago? It comes and goes, mostly when I’m resting, I think. After work, sitting down… that’s when I notice it the most. It's hard to say exactly when, honestly. I've been so busy with the mail route, it all blurs together. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A couple of months, comes and goes, worse with rest… after work. Yes, that makes perfect sense. And you said you’re a mail carrier, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Postal Service. Been doing it… oh, goodness, almost thirty years now. Lots of walking, lots of being on my feet. It’s good exercise, usually, but… well, now this tingling. It worries me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thirty years, that’s dedication! And it's good you're bringing this to my attention. Worries are perfectly normal. Is the tingling in both hands and feet, or is it more prominent on one side?
PATIENT: Both, yes, both hands and both feet. But… I think it’s a little worse in my feet. Especially my left foot, come to think of it. It gets… numb sometimes, too, not just the tingling. Like when I'm trying to put on my shoes in the morning. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, both hands and feet, worse on the left foot, with some numbness as well. Alright. Do you notice anything that relieves the tingling or numbness?
PATIENT: Relieves it? Hmm… Walking sometimes helps, surprisingly. When I’m on my route, it feels better. But then it comes back when I stop. And… shaking my hands, maybe? Just a little bit. Not much really makes it go away completely.
DOCTOR: Walking helps temporarily, shaking hands a little… Alright. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not really, no. I mean, I get tired, of course. Thirty years of delivering mail… But I haven’t dropped anything, or tripped, or anything like that. My grip feels okay, I think. I still manage to sort all the letters! But… maybe I am a little slower than I used to be. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and no, being a little slower doesn't necessarily count as weakness. Just being aware of changes is helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, you know? I’ve got things to do. Just… don’t take too long, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be quick. I'm just going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. First, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, here. Is that good? I can squeeze pretty hard, if I need to. Old habits, you know? From sorting mail, holding all those bundles.
DOCTOR: Very good, that’s quite strong. Now, the left hand please. And that’s good as well. Slightly less strength on the left, but within normal limits. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Let your arm just hang loose. ...and that’s good. Now the left. ...and that's good as well. They’re both present and equal. Now, I’m going to use this little cotton ball to check your sensation. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Alright… go ahead. Just tell me when you touch me, I guess. It tickles, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay… and here… and here… and here… Alright. A little diminished sensation in the tips of both your toes, and the outside of both feet, but still present. I’m going to check your balance now, if you don't mind. Just stand with your feet together and close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh dear… I’m not very good at this, Doctor. I always have trouble with my balance. Whoa! I’m going to fall! Maybe we should skip this part? I really don’t want to fall over in your office.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright, no problem at all. We’ll skip that part. That was good to know. It sounds like you have some decreased sensation in your feet, and slightly less strength in your left hand, and some balance issues. Given your history and the exam, it could be a number of things. We need to rule a few things out. Do you have any diabetes, or has it ever been diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… no, no diabetes. Never been diagnosed. My mother had it, but I’ve always been careful with my sugar. I try to eat healthy, even with how busy I am. It's probably just… old age, isn't it? I’m 63, you know. Things start to fall apart.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily old age, Teretha. While things can change with age, we want to make sure there's not something else going on. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function. It's also possible you have some mild neuropathy, which is nerve damage, and these tests will help us figure that out. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood work, yes, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. Is it going to be expensive? I don’t… I don’t have insurance, you know. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not having insurance can be a worry. Let me check the costs for you. It should be relatively affordable, but I’ll get you a printout with the exact prices. We also have some resources available in the clinic that may help with financial assistance. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I would recommend trying to avoid anything that makes the tingling worse. And please, if the numbness gets significantly worse, or you develop any weakness in your hands or feet, come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Just… get the blood work done, and let me know what it says. I’ve got to get back to my route, you know? Lots of mail to deliver. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully it's nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. We'll get that blood work ordered right away. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples. And don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. We'll get to the bottom of this. Here’s the lab requisition and information about our financial assistance program. Have a safe route.
