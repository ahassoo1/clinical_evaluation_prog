DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been having some discomfort… down there. Yes, that’s right. Testicular pain, you said? It feels… achy, mostly. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it’s been a few days, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down there” discomfort that feels achy for a few days. That is difficult to explain, and you're doing a good job. Just to be absolutely clear – and I want you to feel comfortable – when you say "down there," are you referring to pain in the pelvic region, or are you experiencing pain in the scrotum – that’s the pouch that holds the testicles?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the scrotum… is that… below? Yes, I believe so. It is below. The ache is… there. It’s not sharp, not really. More… a dull throbbing, if that makes sense? It’s hard to describe… I don’t often talk about these things, you see. I'm not sure I understand the difference between the pelvic region and...everything else, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You are doing perfectly fine, Noelani. It's very common for people to be unsure about anatomical terms, and it's absolutely okay to not be familiar with them. And it’s very common for people to be uncomfortable talking about this. That’s why I’m here—to help you feel comfortable. So, just to confirm, the dull, throbbing ache is specifically in your scrotum, the pouch that holds the testicles. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds correct. The scrotum. It’s… a bit swollen, I think. Not hugely, but… noticeable. I noticed it when I was showering this morning. Is that important? I do apologize for not being more… precise. I haven't been feeling myself lately, and my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Noelani. Don’t apologize at all. Swelling is important, so you’re right to point that out. And it's understandable if you haven’t been feeling yourself, that can affect things. Okay, so scrotal pain and swelling for a few days. Has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmmm… it comes and goes, I believe. It's worse when I've been… active, perhaps? Walking a lot, or lifting things. When I'm sitting quietly, it's usually not so bad. It’s not a constant, searing pain, if that helps. More of a nagging discomfort. Though, last night, it kept me up for a little while. It just… ached. It’s difficult to sleep when something is bothering you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent pain, worse with activity, and it kept you up last night. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the scrotum?
PATIENT: Redness… warmth… I hadn’t really noticed. Let me think… no, I don’t think so. It feels… normal to the touch, I suppose? It’s hard to say, truthfully. I’m not very good at… self-exams, you could say. Is there something I should be looking for? I’m sorry, I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Noelani. It's good you're being so honest with me. It's perfectly fine to not be comfortable with self-exams. We can certainly do a physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that, to get a better look. It'll just involve me gently examining your scrotum and surrounding areas. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time. Please, be gentle. And if I ask you to stop, will you? My anxiety gets the better of me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. That’s perfectly fine. We'll take things at your pace, and I will stop immediately if you ask me to. I'll explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. If you’d like, you can lie down on the table. We’ll start with a quick visual inspection, and then I'll gently palpate – that means feel – your scrotum to check for any abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Palpate… you mean feel it? Alright. Just… please, be quick if you can. And tell me if you find anything… anything concerning, that is. I would rather know, even if it’s bad news. It's better to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. I’m going to start by just looking at the scrotum. I’ll be noting the skin color, any obvious swelling, and looking for any visible lumps or bumps. Okay. I do see some mild redness on the left side, and there is slight swelling, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to gently feel the scrotum. I'll let you know if anything feels unusual. Just relaxing your muscles will help… Okay, I do feel a small, firm lump on the left testicle. It’s not particularly large, but it’s definitely there. It doesn’t seem to be causing you pain with this gentle touch. Now, I’m going to feel the right testicle…The right testicle feels normal. Is there any discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a little. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache, right where you’re touching. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely more noticeable now. It feels… different. Harder, as you said. I hadn't noticed it before, not consciously, at least. It’s just… a feeling. A worrisome feeling, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. Thank you for letting me know. The small, firm lump on the left testicle, combined with the discomfort you're feeling with palpation, is concerning enough that we need to investigate further. It’s possible this is something benign – like a cyst – but we need to rule out other possibilities. The most likely next step is an ultrasound of the scrotum. This is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside. It won’t cause you any pain. Would you be comfortable scheduling that?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, I suppose so. If that's what you recommend. What are we… ruling out, exactly? I don't want to alarm myself, but I would rather be prepared, as I said. I’ve always been prone to worry. It’s just… my mother always said a lump meant something bad. Though, she also worried about everything. Is it… cancer? I need to know, even if it’s unpleasant.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Noelani. It’s important to be informed. While a lump can be a sign of cancer – specifically testicular cancer – it’s also important to remember that many other things can cause lumps that are not cancerous. Cysts, inflammation, and infection are all possibilities. The ultrasound will help us determine what the lump is made of and whether it’s likely to be something serious. It's better to be cautious and get it checked out, but I want to emphasize that we don't have enough information yet to say definitively whether or not it’s cancer. We need those imaging results first. I'm going to order the ultrasound for you now. The imaging center is located at [provides address and phone number]. They’re very good, and the technician will explain everything to you beforehand. Would you like me to give you a written order, and also a referral if your insurance requires one?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A written order and a referral… that would be very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, even the unpleasant parts. It's… it's a relief to know we're doing something. Though, I confess, I'm quite anxious about the results. My memory isn't the best, so perhaps you could write down the name of the imaging center again? Just in case I forget. It's been a long day already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. No problem at all. Here is the written order and the referral. The imaging center is called “Suburban Imaging.” Their address is 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-123-4567. I’ve also written it down for you here. Once you’ve had the ultrasound, they’ll send the results to me, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them and plan our next steps. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate you not dismissing my concerns, and for being so thorough. It's been… a stressful experience, but I feel a little better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I suppose all I can do now is schedule the ultrasound and wait. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. That's exactly right – we'll get it checked out. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. I understand this is stressful, and we're here to support you. Take care of yourself, and I’ll be in touch soon. Goodbye, Noelani.
