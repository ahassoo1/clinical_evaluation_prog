DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, tell me what brings you in today. Be concise if you would. My schedule is…rather full.
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. It’s this nausea, see. Been happenin’ most mornings now, for… oh, maybe a month or so. It’s not terrible, but it's enough to put me off my breakfast, and that’s not ideal, given… well, given the heart.
DOCTOR: The heart, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, the heart. They told me it wasn’t pumpin’ as well as it should, a few years back now. Congestive heart failure, that's what they called it. I’m takin' the water pills, like they said, and tryin’ to watch the salt. But this mornin’ sickness… it just feels a bit different, ye ken? It's not like… a normal sick feeling, if that makes sense. More… just queasy, and it comes on quick.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve been taking these water pills – furosemide, I presume – consistently?
PATIENT: Aye, consistently. Every mornin’, same time. Forty milligrams, if that matters. I keep a wee calendar to make sure I don’t miss any. Old age, ye see. The memory’s… not what it used to be for some things, but I remember the pills, thankfully! It’s the names of folk I struggle with now. And where I left my glasses, usually. But the pills, I've been good with them.
DOCTOR: Very good. And aside from the nausea and the known heart condition, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But that could just be the summer heat, couldn't it? And my ankles… they swell up a bit by the end of the day, but they always have, to be honest. It’s hard to say what’s new and what’s just… old age creeping in. I haven't any shortness of breath or chest pain, thankfully. Nothing like that.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, aside from the nausea preventing your breakfast?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. Actually, now that ye mention it, I haven’t been as hungry for dinner either, these past few weeks. Not dramatically, mind ye. Just… not as ravenous as usual. I used to look forward to a good plate of fish and chips, but now… it just doesn't appeal as much. It's a bit odd, really. I'm not one to complain about my food, generally.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed to a brief physical examination. Please, lie back on the examination table. We shall start with listening to your heart and lungs. And, if you do not mind, I will also need to palpate your abdomen. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all, Doctor. Just let me know if ye need me to do anything special. I’m not much good at relaxin' these days, but I’ll try my best. Palpate, ye say? Is that… pushin' on the tummy? Right then, let’s get to it.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated and there is a noticeable S3 gallop. Lungs are clear, but there is mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness, thankfully. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, aye, a wee bit. Not sharp, mind ye. More… dull and achin’. Like a bruise, almost. I just thought it was old age, or maybe I slept on it funny. It’s not constant, it comes and goes. But ye're right to ask, it definitely feels a bit sore there. Is that…bad? It’s not somethin' I’ve bothered the doctor about before, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any changes in your stool color, or any nausea or vomiting, aside from the morning sickness you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The stool… no, not really. Normal colour, as far as I can tell. And no vomiting, thankfully. Just the nausea in the mornings. It’s not like I’m bringin’ anything up, just a bit queasy, like I said. Though, I have been feelin' a bit more tired, and strangely… bloated, lately. Like I've eaten too much, even when I haven't. Is that relevant, do ye think?
DOCTOR: It's likely a combination of factors given your history of congestive heart failure and… shall we say, a less than ideal diet. However, given the tenderness in the right upper quadrant, we must rule out any acute pathology. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We’ll also need an EKG to reassess your heart function. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. If that’s what ye think is best. I trust yer judgement. A bit of poking and prodding, and some blood tests… I can manage that. And the EKG… that’s the thing with the sticky pads, right? I've had that done before. I’m not fond of the cold gel, mind ye, but it's all in a good cause. Should I avoid anythin’ in particular before the tests? Salt, or… fish and chips?
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive salt intake, naturally. And refrain from strenuous activity for the next 24 hours. The nurse will explain the procedure for the blood draw and the EKG. We will review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, or vomiting – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand perfectly, Doctor. No excessive salt, no strenuous activity, and head to the emergency room if things get bad. It’s all quite clear. And I’ll try to avoid the fish and chips, for the sake of the tests, ye ken? I appreciate yer thoroughness, and I’ll see the nurse now, then. Hopefully, these tests will tell us what's going on. Thank you, Doctor. .
