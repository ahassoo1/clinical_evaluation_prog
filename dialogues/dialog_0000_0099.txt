DOCTOR: Alright, Denis Minatra, 67 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Batara. It's a pleasure to meet you. I received a letter regarding some results from a test… a GI Endo test, it said. I must confess, I'm not entirely sure what that is, precisely, but the letter suggested I come in for a discussion. It concerned me a little, so I thought it best to be cautious.
DOCTOR: A GI endoscopy. Yes, I see it here. Well, “pleasure” is a strong word, but I appreciate you taking it seriously. It's a procedure where we use a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end to look at your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. We do it to investigate… well, a lot of things. And it is good you’re here. Honestly, most people don't bother following up on these things. So, let's start simply. Before we get into what the test showed, can you tell me what symptoms you were experiencing that led to the test being ordered in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. A camera… that sounds rather… thorough. Well, to be perfectly honest, Doctor, it wasn’t anything dramatic that sent me to the doctor initially. Just… a persistent discomfort. A sort of burning sensation, mostly after I ate. And a feeling of being… full, rather quickly. I attributed it to getting older, really. Changes in digestion, you know? It wasn't debilitating, but it was becoming… regular. My previous doctor suggested the test, just to rule things out. He retired shortly after, and the results… well, here we are. I suppose that’s the entire story.
DOCTOR: “Attributed it to getting older.” Right. That's what a lot of people say. And it's… not always wrong, but it's better to investigate. So, this burning sensation… is it primarily in your upper abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s accurate. Primarily in my upper abdomen, yes. And… it sometimes radiates up towards my chest, a little. Not a sharp pain, mind you. More of a… warmth. An uncomfortable warmth. It doesn’t happen with every meal, but perhaps three out of five times, I would say. And it’s usually within an hour of eating. I haven’t noticed any… bleeding, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: No bleeding, good. Radiating to the chest… alright. And what about what you’re eating?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don't believe there's any particular food that always triggers it. I've tried to be mindful, naturally. I’ve reduced spicy foods, fatty foods… the usual suspects. But honestly, Doctor, it seems to happen regardless of my diet. Perhaps a little worse with larger portions, but I wouldn’t say it’s reliably connected to anything specific. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee in the mornings, if that might be a factor?
DOCTOR: Coffee… alright. We'll get to that. Look, Denis, the endoscopy report shows some inflammation in your stomach lining. Specifically, it indicates chronic gastritis. And… some mild changes in the cells. Nothing alarming at this stage, but it warrants further attention. Have you ever had a Helicobacter pylori test?
PATIENT: Gastritis… that sounds rather unpleasant. Inflammation… I confess, Doctor, I hadn’t anticipated anything beyond a simple upset stomach. Helicobacter pylori… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve had numerous blood tests over the years, of course, for routine check-ups, but I don’t recall ever being specifically tested for that. Is that… a bacterium? Is that what causes the inflammation? I apologize for my ignorance, I truly am not well-versed in these medical matters.
DOCTOR: It is a bacterium. Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori, is a common cause of gastritis and stomach ulcers. It burrows into the stomach lining and causes inflammation. That's why we need to test for it. We can do a stool test, a breath test, or even a biopsy during another endoscopy if necessary. Honestly, a lot of people get this. It’s not a sign of anything… untoward, necessarily. But it needs to be treated. We’ll start with a stool test. It’s simple enough. I’ll write you a requisition. And, frankly, you shouldn’t be drinking coffee until we have the results. It exacerbates the inflammation.
PATIENT: A stool test… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. And no coffee… That will be… a challenge, I must admit. But if it’s necessary for my health, I shall persevere. Doctor, you mentioned "changes in the cells." I understand you said they weren’t alarming, but… could you elaborate, please? I apologize for pressing, but it does cause me some anxiety. Is there any possibility of… something more serious? I'd prefer to be fully informed, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Look, Denis. You’re… anxious, I understand. The changes are minimal. They're called intestinal metaplasia. It means some of the cells in your stomach lining have changed to resemble cells found in the intestine. It’s often associated with chronic inflammation. And, yes, it can be a precursor to more serious conditions, like stomach cancer, eventually. But, and I want to emphasize this, it’s early. Very early. That’s why we monitor it. We need to see if it's progressing. We'll do a repeat endoscopy in a year, to see if there’s any significant change. We'll treat the H. pylori if it’s present, and we'll manage your symptoms with medication. But, please, don’t jump to conclusions. It’s very treatable, and we caught it early. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Intestinal metaplasia… I see. So, the H. pylori test is to determine if that is contributing to this change? And the repeat endoscopy is simply to monitor the progress, or lack thereof? Doctor, if the H. pylori is present, what does the treatment involve? And is there anything else I can do, besides medication and avoiding coffee, to help manage the inflammation? I understand you're very busy, and I appreciate your patience with my questions. It's just… this is all rather unsettling news.
DOCTOR: Yes, the H. pylori test will tell us if that bacterium is present. And if it is, the treatment is a course of antibiotics, usually combined with a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid. It’s a ten- to fourteen-day course. As for what you can do… frankly, most people don't bother. Diet plays a role, but you've already reduced the usual suspects. Smaller, more frequent meals are better. Avoid alcohol. And stop stressing about it. Stress exacerbates everything. I'll write you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. We'll see what the H. pylori test says. Here. Take this. And get the stool test done as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions, or can we proceed?
PATIENT: Smaller meals… avoid alcohol… and try to reduce stress… yes, that sounds… reasonable. Doctor, I believe that covers my immediate concerns. I shall get the stool test done as soon as possible, and I will endeavor to follow your instructions regarding diet and stress. Thank you for your time and your thorough explanation. I appreciate your patience with my numerous questions. I believe that is all for today, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get the test done, follow the instructions. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Next.
PATIENT: I shall, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. .
