DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Seil, you say? Hmm. Yes, well... I just moved here, see? New place. Need to... get checked, I suppose. Medicare, they said I need to find a doctor, yes? Not feeling bad, exactly. Just... new. Everything is new.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. A welcome check-up is a very good idea when you're establishing care with a new doctor. And yes, Medicare does require that you select a primary care physician. So, let's consider this your “getting to know you” appointment. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about why you decided to come in now, even though you’re not feeling acutely ill?
PATIENT: Acute... what? Look, I do faces. Makeup. For the theater, mostly. But... old faces need looking at too, yes? Just... it's good to know things are working. I am 58, you know. Things start to go, they tell me. Not that I feel anything. Just… sensible. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: “Acute” just means suddenly or severely. No need to worry about the terminology. And yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s perfectly good enough. It’s very sensible to want a check-up to ensure everything is functioning as it should, especially with a change in location and establishing new care. So, let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. A tooth, maybe? Long ago. And… I think I had the measles as a boy. Very sick. Mother was… upset. But nothing serious. I’ve always been strong. I work with chemicals all the time, you know. Strong lungs! And… what else? My first wife… she had problems. But that’s not my history, is it? Just… a lot of worry, long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles as a child and a tooth extraction. And I understand you had some difficult experiences with your first wife’s health. We can focus on your health today, Mr. Szmyd. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I eat everything. Drink everything. Smoke everything, sometimes. My mother, she was very careful about what I ate as a boy. But that was… a long time ago. And a different country. Everything is different now. I don’t think I am allergic to anything. Maybe dust? But who isn’t?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. And you mentioned smoking. Do you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Do I… yes. Sometimes. Not every day. When I am… stressed. Or thinking. It helps me think, you know? I used to smoke more, with the theater. Long hours, lots of pressure. Now… less. But still. A cigarette now and then.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing this helps me understand your overall health picture. Approximately how many cigarettes do you smoke on an average day when you are smoking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Average… that is difficult. Maybe… five? Sometimes less. Sometimes more. If the play is bad, you know? Or if I am remembering… things. It’s not a steady thing. A habit, mostly. An old habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately five cigarettes on days when you smoke. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… no. Nothing. I don’t trust them. Too many chemicals. My mother, she always said, “Natural is best.” And I agree. I take… sometimes, a little something for my stomach. But it is… a tea. From the market. Not a real medicine, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular prescription medications, just the occasional herbal tea for your stomach. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That is… complicated. My father… he worked in a factory. Didn’t talk much. Died young. Something with his lungs, I think. My mother… she lived a long time. Very strong woman. But she… worried a lot. My brother… I haven’t seen him in years. He went to America, I think. I don’t know anything about his health. It’s… not something we discussed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Szmyd. It's understandable that you don't have a lot of information about your family history. Your father had lung problems and your mother worried a lot – that’s helpful to know. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to ask a few questions about how you’ve been feeling overall. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, energy levels, sleep patterns, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes… no, not really. I eat when I am hungry. Sleep when I am tired. Everything is… normal. Maybe I am a little more tired than I used to be. But that is just… age, yes? And the move. Everything is new, and that takes energy. My bowels… they are fine. Sometimes a little… slow. But the tea helps with that, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant changes in weight or appetite, a little more tired than usual, and occasionally a bit of constipation which you manage with tea. That’s helpful. Now, have you been experiencing any pain, discomfort, or unusual symptoms anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… no. Not really. Sometimes my back aches a little. But that is just from… bending over faces all day, you know? And sometimes my hands… they are stiff. But that is just from holding the brushes. Old age, yes? Nothing serious. I am not a young man.
DOCTOR: Okay, some back pain and hand stiffness, likely related to your work. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. Just a quick look at your heart, lungs, and a general check-up. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical… yes. Fine. I don’t mind. Just… be gentle with my hands, yes? They are important. I need them for… the faces. Everything else… do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will be very gentle with your hands. Okay, let's start with your heart. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Take another deep breath… and out… good. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Open your mouth for me, please… Throat looks clear, no signs of infection. Ears look normal as well. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Some mild crepitus in the finger joints, as you mentioned, but no significant swelling or redness. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits for your age, with some mild crepitus in your finger joints. Everything else appears to be functioning as expected.
PATIENT: Hmm. Crepitus. Is that bad? Like… breaking? I need my hands!
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, crepitus isn’t necessarily bad. It just means there’s a bit of a grating or cracking sound in your joints, which is common as we age. It’s often due to changes in the cartilage, and doesn’t always indicate a problem. You mentioned needing your hands for your work, and I understand your concern. It doesn’t sound like there’s anything acutely concerning at this time, but it could be a sign of early arthritis. To get a better understanding, and just to be on the safe side given your occupation, I'd like to order some simple blood work. It will check for inflammation and other markers that can help us assess your joint health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes. Fine. If it will help my hands, then do it. I don’t like needles, but… for the faces, I will do it. When can I do this?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. No one enjoys needles. We can do the blood work right here in the clinic today. It will only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll review them together and discuss any necessary steps. In the meantime, I’d like to recommend some gentle hand exercises to help maintain your range of motion and flexibility. I can print out a handout with some simple exercises for you. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Hand exercises… yes. Please. Anything to keep them working. I need them. The faces… they depend on them. And… is there anything I can do? To help? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s a handout with some gentle hand exercises. It’s important to do them regularly, but don't push yourself to the point of pain. As for things you can do to help, avoiding repetitive motions for extended periods is good, if possible. Taking frequent breaks during work can also help. Warm water soaks can soothe your hands and improve circulation. And, if you notice any significant pain, swelling, or stiffness, stop the activity and rest. To summarise, we'll get the blood work done today to rule out anything serious. I recommend the gentle hand exercises and taking breaks during work. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… no. Just… thank you. For not laughing at the faces. And for looking at my hands. That is good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I assure you, there's absolutely nothing to laugh at. The faces sound fascinating, and your hands are incredibly important. That’s why we’re taking these precautions. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. After that, you're free to go. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they are available. If you have any questions or concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Szmyd. Have a good day.
