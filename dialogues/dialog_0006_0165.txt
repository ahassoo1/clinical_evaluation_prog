DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this fever. Keeps comin' back. It ain't like a bad flu fever, more...on and off. Been happenin' for a few weeks now, I reckon. It's gettin' old, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, on and off for a few weeks… right. And you said it doesn't feel like a typical flu fever?
PATIENT: No, not really. Flu, I know. This is…lighter, but it bothers me 'cause it keeps comin' back. Like, I'll feel fine for a day, maybe two, then boom, there it is again. Not high, maybe 100, 101 at the most. But enough to make me feel lousy.
DOCTOR: 100 to 101... Okay. And besides the fever, anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. I'm a little tired, I guess, but I'm 65, doc! Tired comes with the territory, ya know? No cough, no aches…just the fever. And the annoyance of it keepin' on comin' back.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, no aches…just the recurring fever and some fatigue. Have you noticed anything with the fever?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yeah. Sometimes, when the fever hits, my joints feel a little…stiff. Not painful, exactly, just…not as loose as usual. Mostly my hands and knees, I think. It doesn’t last long, just while the fever is up.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint stiffness coinciding with the fever. Hands and knees specifically. Hmm… Alright. Let’s get a little more information. Have you traveled anywhere recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left Puerto Rico in…oh, goodness, must be ten years now? Used to go visit my daughter in Florida, but not lately. Just stayin' put. Ain’t got much reason to go anywhere. And I haven’t been out in the woods or nothin', either. This ain’t like a tick bite or somethin', I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel, no exposure to ticks… That’s helpful. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Well, doc, I got a little arthritis in my hands, been dealin' with that for a while. Not too bad, just a little achiness sometimes. And my blood pressure’s a little high, but I don’t take nothin’ for it. Doc said to watch my salt, and I mostly do. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for an old guy!
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and slightly elevated blood pressure. No medication currently. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin'. Took penicillin as a kid, and I remember gettin' shots, but nothin' ever bothered me. I ain’t taken much in the way of pills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, doc. Old lady – my wife – makes sure I take one every mornin'. Says I need it. And sometimes, if I'm achin' a little, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that ain't regular, just now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily, ibuprofen as needed. Let me ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, I think. And my father had heart trouble, needed a pacemaker when he got older. And my sister… she had something with her joints, arthritis maybe, but I don't really remember the details. Old age, ya know? Everyone gets somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and some joint issues. Alright, Mr. Brege, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. Can you step over here onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Sure, doc. Whatever you need. Just let me know if you need me to do somethin' silly. I ain't as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, 121 pounds. And your height is 154 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds right. Always been a little on the small side. Used to bother me when I was younger, but now… it's just me. What’s next, doc? Can we get this over with, I gotta get home to my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Let's listen to your heart and lungs, if you don't mind. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… good. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds…regular. Now, let me check your joints, just to see if there's any swelling or tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, doc. Just…stiff. Like I said, when the fever comes on. Feels a little tighter in my knees, especially. And my hands feel a bit…creaky. It ain't sharp or nothin', just…uncomfortable. Don't take long, though. Feels better when the fever goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, slight stiffness noted in both knees and hands, correlating with reported fever. No visible swelling or redness. Alright. Now, I’d like to check your temperature and pulse. Temperature is 100.5 Fahrenheit. Pulse is 78 and regular. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like you have a recurring low-grade fever with associated joint stiffness. However, to be certain, I’d like to order some blood work. It’ll help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Alright, doc, if you think it's necessary. I ain’t crazy about needles, but I trust your judgment. How much is this gonna cost, though? I don’t have insurance, and my wife’s been worried about money lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Brege. Let me check the pricing for the basic panel. It includes a complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a few inflammatory markers. It'll be around $150-200. We can discuss potential payment options if that's a concern. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. If the fever spikes significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, like a rash or severe pain, please come back immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: $150-200… That’s a bit steep, but… alright, doc. Do what you gotta do. I’ll try and scrape it together. Rest and fluids…I can do that. My wife makes a mean chicken soup. So, I just gotta wait for the results then? And if things get worse, I come back right away. Got it. Can we get this over with then? I got things to do, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Brege, you just need to wait for the results. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and they will let you know when the results are available. They usually contact you by phone. Here is the requisition form and instructions. And yes, if anything changes, or if you start feeling significantly worse, please don't hesitate to come back or call the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that’s it, doc. Just gettin’ this over with. Thank you for seein’ me. Hopefully, this blood work tells us what’s goin’ on. Now if you’ll excuse me… I gotta go find that lab technician.
