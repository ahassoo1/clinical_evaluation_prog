DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, it's my legs, mostly. They are… puffy. After the cancer, you see. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not sure exactly when. It's just… swelling.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your legs, starting a few weeks ago. And you mentioned “after the cancer” – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I had… the treatments. Chemo, and then radiation. It was for… well, it was in my breast. Everything was good for a while, but then this started. I don't know if it's from that, maybe? I just want it to go away. It makes walking hard, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's definitely worth investigating to see if there's a connection. Swelling after cancer treatment can be related, yes. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the swelling a bit more?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… both legs, but the left one is worse. It's not… pain, exactly. More like… heavy. And it looks bigger, you know? Like it's filled with water. Sometimes it feels tight, like my skin is too small. I wear support stockings, but they don’t always help. It's worse at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Both legs, worse on the left, feeling heavy and tight, worse at the end of the day, and the support stockings don’t provide complete relief. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. It's a little red sometimes, on the left one. And… it's a little shiny, I think. Not a lot, but maybe. It doesn’t hurt to touch, though. Just looks… different. I haven't really looked at it that closely, to be honest. I just notice it’s bigger. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, redness and shininess on the left leg are worth noting. It's good you’re telling me all of this. Let's do a quick examination of your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could sit here on the table, that would be perfect. I'm going to gently examine both legs, checking for tenderness, warmth, and the extent of the swelling. I'll also feel your pulses to get a sense of the circulation. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, feeling your right leg now. Not much tenderness here. Skin feels normal temperature. Now let's do the left one. Hmm. Your left leg is warmer to the touch, and there’s some tenderness here when I press. The swelling is also more pronounced on this side. And I can feel a slightly diminished pulse compared to your right leg. Do you notice any difference when I touch those areas?
PATIENT: Yes! That's… that's where it feels tight. And a little achy, sometimes. Not a bad ache, just… there. I hadn't really said anything about the ache because it's not really pain, you know? But when you touch it, yes, I feel something. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s important to tell me even if it’s not severe pain. The warmth, tenderness, diminished pulse, and the ache you’re describing are concerning for a few possibilities, including possible lymphedema or, less likely, a blood clot. To rule out a blood clot, we’re going to need to do an ultrasound of both legs. And to assess for lymphedema, we should also consult with a physical therapist specializing in cancer rehabilitation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a physical therapist? Oh dear. Is it serious? I don’t like tests. And I don’t want anything… complicated. I just want the swelling to go away. What does the ultrasound do? And what will the physical therapist do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we’re taking this seriously but also being cautious. The ultrasound is a non-invasive test – it uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your legs. It doesn’t hurt at all, and it takes about 30-45 minutes. It will help us determine if there’s a blood clot present, which is important to rule out. As for the physical therapist, they specialize in helping people recover from cancer treatments and manage side effects like lymphedema. They can teach you specific exercises and techniques to reduce the swelling, improve circulation, and prevent it from getting worse. It's not complicated, and it could really help you feel better. We’ll start with the ultrasound to get a clearer picture. Would you like me to explain anything else about either test before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay. No… I think I understand. Sound waves… that sounds okay. And exercises… well, I suppose exercises are better than… something else. But what if it is a blood clot? What do you do then?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. If the ultrasound does show a blood clot, the treatment depends on the size and location of the clot. It could involve medication to thin the blood, compression stockings, and in some cases, a procedure to remove the clot. We have excellent specialists here who are very experienced in treating blood clots, and we would discuss all the options with you in detail. However, it's important to remember that a blood clot is not the most likely scenario. Swelling after cancer treatment is often related to lymphedema, which, as I mentioned, can be effectively managed with physical therapy. Let’s focus on getting the ultrasound done first, so we have a clear understanding of what we’re dealing with. I’ll write the order for it now. Would you like me to call someone to come explain the procedure to you, or would you prefer I explain it again?
PATIENT: No, I think… you explained it okay. No need to bother anyone. Just… get it over with, I suppose. And then the exercises. As long as they aren't too… hard. When can I have the ultrasound? I don't want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve just ordered the ultrasound, and they’re able to fit you in this afternoon at 2:30 PM. Here’s a slip with the details. The technician will explain the procedure to you when you arrive. I’ll also write a referral for physical therapy. Once we have the results of the ultrasound, we can discuss the best course of action with the physical therapist. Do you have any questions about the ultrasound appointment or the referral?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. 2:30… okay. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I just hope it’s not too bad. I should probably go now. .
