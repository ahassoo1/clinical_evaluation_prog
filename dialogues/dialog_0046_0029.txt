DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this feeling of being full after just a little bit of food. It's been happenin’ for a while now, and my wife, Elsie, she says I should get it checked out. Don’t always listen to her, but… here I am.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Mr. Obarr. It's good Elsie encouraged you to come see me. Feeling full quickly, even after a small amount of food, can be caused by a number of things. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain exactly. It's not like I’m in pain, or anything. Just… like my stomach’s givin’ up after a few bites. Doesn't matter what I'm eatin', really. Soup, fish, a sandwich… all the same. Used to be able to put away a good plate, you know? Now… a few mouthfuls and I'm done. It's been happenin’ maybe… six months or so? Hard to say for sure, old man forgets things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, and six months is definitely long enough to warrant a look. It’s good you’re noticing and we’re addressing it. And don’t worry about forgetting – it happens to the best of us! So, it sounds like the amount of food you can eat has decreased over the past six months, regardless of what you're eating. Has there been any change in your weight during that time?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… Elsie keeps sayin’ I’m gettin’ thinner. I haven’t weighed myself in ages, to be honest. Used to be a pretty solid fella, always been lean but… yeah, I guess I am. Not a lot, mind you, but she’s right, I think. She's usually right about things like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. That's important information. Weight loss along with early satiety – that feeling of fullness after only a small amount of food – does raise some concerns, and we’ll want to investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… not that I can recall. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I'm 88 years old, Doctor! Tired comes with the territory, eh? No stomach pain, no heartburn, nothin' like that. Just… full too fast and gettin’ a bit skinnier. Elsie says my skin looks a bit… pale, but she worries too much, that woman.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t experienced any pain or heartburn, that’s helpful to know. And it's true, fatigue can come with age. It's wonderful Elsie is so attentive. Now, let's go over a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that was about it. High blood pressure for a bit, but the doctor put me on some pills, and that sorted it out. Been off 'em for years now, blood pressure’s been fine ever since. Otherwise… pretty healthy for an old Haida man, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Obarr. It sounds like you’ve been quite fortunate. And being healthy for 88 years is definitely something to be proud of! Were there any surgeries other than your appendix removed, and do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, just the appendix. And no allergies that I know of. Elsie always double-checks when she makes me new meals or somethin', so if there was somethin', she'd know. She’s a careful one. Never had a reaction to anythin’, that I remember.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It’s good Elsie is so vigilant about that. And now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my joints, sometimes. When they're actin' up. It's… glucosamine, I think. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, Elsie gives me a bit of melatonin. But that’s it, really. Nothin’ regular. Just when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine as needed for your joints and melatonin occasionally for sleep. That's helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you're comfortable. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had trouble with her stomach when she got older. A lot of pain, they never really knew what it was. Some kind of… blockage, I think. She was a strong woman, though, didn't complain much. My father… he had a weak heart. Died pretty young, I think it was in his 60s. And my brother… he had diabetes. Got it when he was younger.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. That is important information to know. A family history of stomach issues, heart disease, and diabetes is certainly something we need to consider. Finally, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father tried, but Elsie wouldn't let him in the house if he did! She always said they were bad for your health, and she was right.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy, usually just a glass or two. Elsie and I both enjoy it. It’s a Haida tradition, you know? But nothing excessive. Not a problem, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine with dinner occasionally. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Obarr. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve been poked and prodded by doctors enough times in my life. Just try not to tickle too much!
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate further. Your reflexes are a bit slower than expected, which is common at your age, but otherwise everything seems normal. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, and a few other markers. I also want to order a stool test to rule out any hidden bleeding or infection. Finally, given your symptoms and family history, I’d like to order an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach and duodenum. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Endoscopy? What’s that involve, exactly? Sounds… serious. Stool tests and blood tests are fine, but this… endoscopy… is it painful? Do I have to be put to sleep? I’m not sure I like the sound of that. Is there another way to find out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask questions, Mr. Obarr, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your esophagus, stomach and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for any abnormalities. It’s usually performed with sedation to keep you comfortable and minimize any discomfort. Most patients don’t remember much of the procedure. It's the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms, and given your weight loss, family history of stomach issues, and the tenderness I detected during the exam, I think it’s important to consider. There are other tests we could consider, such as a CT scan, but they don’t provide as detailed of an image as an endoscopy. They also involve radiation exposure. I understand your hesitation, and we don’t have to proceed with it right away. We can start with the blood and stool tests and see what those reveal. If they are inconclusive, then we can revisit the option of an endoscopy. However, I want to emphasize that an early diagnosis is crucial in these situations, and delaying the procedure could potentially worsen the outcome. Would you like me to explain the risks and benefits of the endoscopy in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me about the risks. And how long does it take? And… what if they find something? I'm gettin’ a bit worried now, to be honest. I just want to know what’s wrong, and I want to be able to eat again.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr, and it’s completely natural to feel worried. Let's talk through everything. An endoscopy typically takes about 30 minutes to an hour to complete. You’ll receive sedation through an IV, which will make you feel relaxed and drowsy. Most patients are able to go home the same day, although you’ll need someone to drive you. Now, regarding the risks, they are relatively low. The most common risks include bloating, cramping, and a sore throat after the procedure. There is a very small risk of bleeding, infection, or perforation of the esophagus or stomach, but these complications are rare. We take every precaution to minimize these risks. As for what if we find something, it depends on what it is. It could be something as simple as inflammation or an ulcer, which can be treated with medication. In other cases, it could be something more serious, such as a polyp or even cancer. If we find anything concerning, we’ll discuss it with you in detail and develop a treatment plan together. We would also refer you to a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive disorders. I want to assure you that we’re here to support you every step of the way. We’ll answer all your questions, address your concerns, and provide you with the best possible care. For now, let’s focus on the blood and stool tests. We'll get those results back within a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Schedule the tests. And… could I bring my wife, Elsie, with me when we get the results? She worries too much, but she's good at askin' questions that I forget to think of.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Obarr. I’m happy to schedule the tests for you, and Elsie is more than welcome to join us when we discuss the results. It's always helpful to have another perspective, and as you said, she often thinks of important questions. Okay, I’ve scheduled your blood tests and stool test for next Tuesday morning at 8:00 AM at the lab just down the street. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours beforehand, so no breakfast that morning. I’ll have the lab results sent to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or bleeding, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
