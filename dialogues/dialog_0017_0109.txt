DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste time. You've taken up a slot on my schedule, so if you could simply tell me what brings you in today, that would be most efficient. Be concise, please.
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Brum is the name. My head… the back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a sharp pain. Just… there.
DOCTOR: A “little while now” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Brum. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, sorry, Doctor. Maybe… three weeks? Started after I helped my grandson move some things. He has a new apartment. Lots of boxes. Heavy boxes. I lifted some with him. Back of the head started hurting a day or two after that. Not right away, though.
DOCTOR: Boxes, you say. And this ache... does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… resting helps a little. When I sit quiet, it’s not so bad. But if I… move around too much, or if I get… excited, it gets worse. Like when my grandson came over yesterday, we were talking and laughing… it really hurt then. Not a terrible pain, but… noticeable. Drinking water doesn’t seem to help.
DOCTOR: So, exertion and… emotional stimulation aggravate it. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this headache, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe… a little tired, but I am ninety years old, Doctor! I get tired. No dizziness. No blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Just the headache in the back of my head. And the tiredness. But I think that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, naturally. Let's proceed. Now, have you had any previous injuries to your head or neck?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. I worked on the railroad for many years, Doctor. Lots of bumps and bruises, but never… a bad injury to my head. Maybe a few bonks here and there when I was younger, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a doctor. I was a strong man then! Rail Yard work is hard work. We didn’t have time for doctors.
DOCTOR: Quite. And what about your medical history, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have had a good long life. Never been much for going to doctors, if you know what I mean. I had the flu a few times, of course, when I was a kid. And my wife… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but… I took care of her. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything… serious. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old. I’ve been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Lucky, perhaps. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don't believe in taking too many pills. My wife… she had so many pills at the end. It didn’t help her, you know? I try to eat good food, get a little bit of sun… that’s all I do. Maybe a little coffee in the morning, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I am going to perform a brief examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your neurological function. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Neurological… is that checking my head? Alright. I can lie down. Where is the table?
DOCTOR: Over there, Mr. Brum. And if you could do so with some haste, that would be appreciated. I have other patients waiting. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Please remain still. Right arm… push against my hand… good. Left leg… lift that… alright. Now, follow my finger with your eyes… don't blink…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I'm trying to stay still. It's a little hard, you know, getting up and down. It’s a little blurry when I look to the side, but I am following it. I think. Everything is a little… slow these days. My grandson says I need new glasses.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some tenderness here, along the occipital ridge. No obvious swelling or deformities. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Alright, Mr. Brum. That will be sufficient. It appears you have some muscle tension in your neck and upper back, likely due to strain.
PATIENT: Muscle tension, you say? From lifting boxes with my grandson? That’s what you think? It doesn't feel like just muscle tension, Doctor. It feels… deeper. Like it's inside my head. What are you going to do about it? Will you give me something for the pain?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, with all due respect, you are ninety years old. Some discomfort is to be expected. I suspect this is a simple tension headache, exacerbated by your recent activity. I am not inclined to prescribe medication at this time. However, I will recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen, if you wish. And I suggest you rest, avoid strenuous activity, and perhaps consult an optometrist regarding your vision. I am documenting all of this in your chart. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… that won’t help much, Doctor. My wife used to take that for her arthritis, didn’t do her much good. And my grandson said I need glasses… I know that! But the headache… it’s not just because of my age, or my eyes. It feels different. Like something is… wrong. Are you sure that’s all it is, Doctor? Maybe we should do some more tests? A scan, or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I assure you, I am a qualified physician. I have assessed your condition, and I have reached a conclusion. While I understand your concerns, I do not deem further testing necessary at this time. Frankly, subjecting you to unnecessary procedures at your age would be… imprudent. I am recommending close follow-up with your primary care physician if your symptoms worsen. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. My wife… she always told me to trust the doctor. I just… I don’t want to feel like I’m being dismissed. I just want to know what’s going on in my head. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try the ibuprofen. I’ll see my grandson… and maybe get those glasses.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a summary of our consultation. Please ensure your primary care physician is aware of my findings. And please, do not hesitate to contact the office if you experience any significant changes in your condition. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Good day, Mr. Brum.
