DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Carlotta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Burlingham, yes? It’s… about starting a family. My wife and I, we are… wanting a baby. But we are older now, you see? So, we want to make sure everything is… okay. It’s a bit confusing, all of it.
DOCTOR: A family… at your age. Well. Alright. That's… a decision. Let's try to get some clarity, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Clarity is good. I… I forget things easily now, so maybe you can… explain slowly? My wife is very excited, but I want to be… careful. We have been married a long time, but never… tried for a baby before.
DOCTOR: Right. Careful is sensible, I suppose. Well, let's start with a bit of a medical history, then. You said you’re forgetting things… is this a recent development, or something that’s been building up over time?
PATIENT: It’s… gotten worse, I think. Maybe the last few years? Not so much before. It's not… like I can't remember everything, but… names, dates… important things sometimes. My wife helps me. She has a very good memory. I used to be very good with my hands, building things... small things, you know? Model making. But even that… sometimes I misplace tools, or forget a step.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anyone ever formally assessed this memory issue?
PATIENT: Assessed? You mean… a doctor look at it? No, not really. I told my usual doctor, but he said it's just… getting old. He didn’t do any… tests or anything. Just said to write things down. My wife thinks maybe we should see someone, but I… I didn’t want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “just getting old” can sometimes mask other things, especially when you're considering… this undertaking. We need to rule out anything that could complicate things. Before we get too far, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… a bad back, years ago. From lifting heavy things, building models. They gave me pills. And… I think I had the flu, a few times. Nothing… serious. I don’t go to the doctor much. My wife keeps telling me I should, but I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had one. I… I try to stay healthy. I eat good food, mostly. My wife cooks. And I walk sometimes, when my back isn’t bothering me.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother and father, they are… gone now. A long time ago. I have some cousins, back in Somalia, but I haven't seen them in… many years. We don’t talk much. They have big families, lots of children. I… I don’t know about their health, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… pills for my back, sometimes. When it’s really bad. They are… white and small. My wife gets them for me. I don’t remember the name. And… sometimes a vitamin, for my bones. She thinks I need it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… less than ideal, but we'll work with what we have. Now, I need to do a quick physical exam. It’s just standard procedure, to get a baseline. Can you step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Scale is… okay. I… I hope I haven’t gained too much weight. My wife makes good food.
DOCTOR: 96 kilograms. Alright. And your height is… 1.64 meters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right. About that tall. I haven’t measured myself in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the table, please. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological check. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay. Neurological… is that about my brain? I… I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are… a little slow. I’m going to ask you a few questions now, just to assess your cognitive function. Don’t worry if you don’t get them all right. It's just to get a better picture. Can you tell me what today's date is?
PATIENT: Hmm… today… the date? My wife always remembers these things. Let me think… is it August? Yes, I think it’s August. The second? Yes. August 2nd, 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you spell the word 'world'?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is… a hard one. W… O… R… L… D? I think? I haven’t… I haven’t written anything in a long time. My wife writes the letters.
DOCTOR: Alright. One last question. Can you repeat these three words for me: Apple, Table, Penny?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes. Those words… are easy. Apple, Table, Penny. I can remember those. But… but what did you ask me before?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Carlotta, based on this preliminary exam, and what you’ve told me, there are some concerning signs. Your memory is… impaired, and your cognitive function is below what we’d expect for someone your age. It's also very concerning that you couldn't recall the three words I asked you to repeat. We need to investigate this further before even considering starting a family. This is not a simple matter.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Concerning? What… what does that mean? Is something… wrong with my brain? My wife… she’ll be very worried.
DOCTOR: It means we need to rule out certain conditions, Mr. Carlotta. It could be a number of things, from early stages of dementia to other neurological issues. I'm going to order a full blood panel, and I want you to schedule an appointment with a neurologist immediately. They will likely want to do an MRI of your brain. It’s the only way to get a clear picture of what's going on. And frankly, Mr. Carlotta, until we have those results, any discussion about starting a family is… premature, to say the least. It would be irresponsible of me to even consider it. I will write you a referral now.
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… scary. And… scary. And blood tests… lots of blood? My wife… she will be so upset. Will… will I be okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The MRI is non-invasive, Mr. Carlotta. It simply uses magnetic fields to create an image of your brain. As for the blood tests, yes, there will be several vials taken. It’s necessary to rule out underlying causes. Look, I understand your concerns, but we need to be proactive. Delaying a diagnosis will only make things worse. Here’s the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a very good neurologist. She’ll explain everything in detail. I also recommend bringing your wife to the appointment. She can help you remember everything we discuss. And, frankly, she needs to be involved in this process. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Dr. Reed… I will… I will write that down. My wife… yes, she will come with me. She remembers everything. What… what if it is something… bad, Doctor? What if… what if I am not… myself anymore?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I understand your fear, but I cannot speculate on what the results of the tests will be. That would be irresponsible and unhelpful. What I can tell you is that early diagnosis and intervention can often significantly slow the progression of many conditions. We need to get the information first, then we can discuss a plan. I want to be clear: putting this aside, or hoping it will go away, is not an option. It's important to take care of yourself, for your own well-being, and for the sake of your wife. Now, here's a contact number for Dr. Reed's office. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And please, try to remain calm. Worrying will only exacerbate the situation. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… no other questions. Just… thank you, Doctor. I… I will call Dr. Reed. My wife… she will help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well. Try not to dwell on it, Mr. Carlotta. And please, follow through with the referral. It's the most important thing you can do right now.
PATIENT: .
