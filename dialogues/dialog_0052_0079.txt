DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Shely. Please, call me Courtnye. Um, it's about my bruising. It's just...worse lately. I'm on a blood thinner, and I keep getting these big bruises for no reason, like just bumping into things normally wouldn't cause this. It's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Courtnye. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is something we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it started maybe a month or so ago? Not super sudden, just gradually getting bigger and showing up easier. I noticed it on my arms first, I think, after helping my nephew with some boxes. He's a strong kid, but I didn't even feel a hard bump, just…purple. And then it started happening on my legs too, just from normal stuff. It's just…a lot more than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over about a month. And it began on your arms, then progressed to your legs, even with minimal trauma. I see. Are the bruises painful, or do they appear without any discomfort?
PATIENT: Usually not really painful, honestly. Maybe a little tender at first, like a normal bruise, but nothing major. It's more the size of them, and how easily they show up. Like, I'll just glance at my arm and there's a new one I don't even remember getting. It's kind of freaky.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. That is unusual, and it's wise to investigate. Now, could you tell me what blood thinner you are currently taking, and for what condition it was prescribed?
PATIENT: It's... Warfarin, I think? Something like that. My doctor put me on it about two years ago after I had a blood clot in my leg. It was pretty scary, had to stay in the hospital for a while. They said I needed to be on it long-term to prevent another one. I try to remember to take it every day, but sometimes…life gets busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see Warfarin here, prescribed for a deep vein thrombosis two years ago. Thank you for letting me know. It’s important that you’re taking it consistently to manage the risk of another clot, but fluctuations in dosage can contribute to bruising. Do you have regular blood tests – INR levels – to monitor how well the Warfarin is working?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, I do. Every month, I think. They draw blood at the lab down the street. It's always a bit of a pain, but they said it was important to make sure the dosage was right. Um... the last one was... July 18th, I think. The nurse called with the results and said it was "in range," but I don't really understand all that medical stuff. Does that mean anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does mean something. Let me just pull up your results from July 18th… Okay, I see here your INR was 2.1. That is within the therapeutic range for most patients on Warfarin. However, even within range, there can be some variability. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about other medications you’re taking – including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements – and your general medical history. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. I don't take a whole lot of stuff, honestly. Just a multivitamin sometimes, and ibuprofen for headaches if I really need it. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, and... oh! And I had a really bad flu last winter, but that's about it. I try to stay healthy. Is ibuprofen okay to take with the Warfarin? I always worry about mixing things.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Thank you for sharing that, Courtnye. And you’re right to be cautious about mixing medications. Ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can slightly increase your risk of bleeding, especially while on Warfarin, so it's best to avoid it if possible. Acetaminophen – Tylenol – would be a safer option for headaches. Now, regarding your medical history, have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, that you can recall?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, little bumps and scrapes, but nothing serious. Like I said, it's just…bruises appearing for no reason. I haven't fallen or anything. It's weird. It almost feels like...my skin is just fragile or something.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Courtnye. It certainly sounds concerning. Given your history of DVT, current Warfarin therapy, and the unexplained bruising, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll want to look at the bruises themselves, assess your overall skin health, and check for any signs of bleeding elsewhere. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm not really one for a lot of fuss, but I don't want another blood clot, you know? So if you think an exam is a good idea, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course. And you are right to be proactive about preventing another clot. Let's start with a look at your arms. Okay, I'm noting several ecchymoses – that’s the medical term for bruising – on your forearms and upper arms, varying in size from approximately 2 to 5 centimeters. They appear to be in different stages of healing, indicating they occurred at different times. The skin feels warm and dry, and I don’t note any significant swelling or tenderness to palpation. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs and check your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Heart sounds are regular, rate and rhythm are within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No hepatosplenomegaly is noted.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Everything sounds...normal, I guess? I just hope it’s not anything serious. I have a nephew's birthday party next weekend, and I really don’t want to miss it. I promised him I’d help him build a Lego castle. He's six, and he's very excited.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful about the Lego castle, Courtnye. We certainly don't want anything to interfere with that! Based on the physical exam, there are no immediately concerning signs. However, the unexplained bruising, even with a therapeutic INR, warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. These tests will help us evaluate your overall blood health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to the bruising. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. A CBC and a...peripheral blood smear, right? I'll write that down, just so I remember. Is that something I can get done at the same lab as the INR test? I hate going to a bunch of different places.
DOCTOR: Yes, thankfully, the lab down the street can perform both the CBC and the peripheral blood smear. I'm sending the order to them electronically now. They should be expecting you. It’s best to schedule an appointment if possible, just to minimize wait times. I’ll also give you a printed requisition form, just in case. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding ibuprofen and using acetaminophen for any pain relief. Also, be mindful of any potential injuries and try to protect yourself from bumps and scrapes as much as possible. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available, and formulate a plan from there. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Acetaminophen, no ibuprofen. Got it. And schedule an appointment at the lab. Okay. So, you don't think it’s anything really serious, do you? Like, not a sign of another blood clot forming or something?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Courtnye, and it’s good you’re asking. While unexplained bruising can sometimes be a sign of a clotting issue, it’s also important to remember that there are many other possible causes, such as medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or even just age-related changes in the skin. Given your stable INR and the absence of any other concerning symptoms – such as leg pain, swelling, or shortness of breath – I don’t believe an acute blood clot is the most likely cause at this time. However, we need to rule out other possibilities with the CBC and peripheral smear to be certain. We’re being proactive in investigating this, and I’ll be sure to contact you immediately if anything concerning arises from the lab results. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. You’ve explained everything really well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not dismiss it as “just bruising.” I'll schedule the lab appointment tomorrow. Thanks again, Dr. Shely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. It’s always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to your health. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, and I hope your nephew enjoys his birthday party! .
