DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I'm Dr. Deschane. It says here you’re ninety years old. That’s quite something. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Ninety... yes, I think so. Time goes fast, you know? Well, my tummy... it’s getting big. Not fat big, but swollen big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Everything just... feels heavy. I don’t know what’s wrong. It just started a few weeks ago, maybe? It’s hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. Swollen, not fat, but heavy… and a loss of appetite. Alright. Can you describe the swelling more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s all over, really. Not just one spot. Mostly here… …and a little bit here too. It feels… tight. Like a balloon, but not painful, you know? Just… uncomfortable. And full, even when I haven't eaten. I used to have a good appetite! Everything tasted so good. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. “Tight, not painful, but uncomfortable and full.” I see you haven't had a recent abdominal exam documented. Let’s take a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. It's just… my body isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. I hope it's not something too serious. Do you need me to… lie down? I used to be very strong, you know. A farmer's daughter, I was. Always working. But that was a long time ago…
DOCTOR: Yes, if you would please lie down on the examination table, that would be helpful. Just on your back to start. And yes, things change. That's why we’re here – to figure out what has changed. I'll listen to your abdomen, and then we’ll do a quick palpation – that’s just feeling your tummy to check for any tenderness or masses. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but let me know if anything is painful.
PATIENT: Okay… a table. Pal… palpation? Oh dear. Is that like… pressing? Well, if you have to, I suppose. Just be gentle, please? My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. And… what are you looking for exactly? I always worry about everything… It's a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Palpation is simply feeling your abdomen, yes. And I will be gentle. We're looking for any areas of tenderness, any masses, or anything that feels unusual. I'll start by listening with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Bowel sounds are… diminished. Not absent, but quieter than I would expect.
PATIENT: Diminished…? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Is that… bad? I used to have a very rumbling tummy, you know. Always loud. Always meant I was healthy. What does it mean if the sounds are quiet? Are you sure it’s not just because I haven’t eaten much? I had a little soup yesterday… but not much. It didn’t taste very good, to be honest. Everything tastes… bland.
DOCTOR: Diminished bowel sounds can indicate a few things, Ms. McConnon. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to investigate. And yes, decreased appetite can certainly contribute, but it’s not a full explanation. You mentioned some tenderness here… …and it feels slightly distended. I’m going to ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Have you had a bowel movement recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that does hurt a little. Just a little. Like a dull ache. Distended… is that… swollen? Everything feels so confusing. And bowel… habits? Oh dear. It’s been… a few days. Maybe four? I don't really keep track anymore, to be honest. It's not something a lady talks about, you know. But… not as regular as it used to be. Definitely not. I used to be very… regular. It’s one of the first things that goes, isn’t it? With getting old?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. McConnon, changes in bowel habits are common with age, but that doesn’t mean we ignore them. Given your diminished bowel sounds, abdominal distension, tenderness, and infrequent bowel movements, I’m concerned about a possible obstruction. It could be something as simple as constipation, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some blood work and an abdominal X-ray. The X-ray will help us see if there's a blockage. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye…? Oh dear. What is that? Is that something they inject into me? I don’t think I’ve ever had dye injected into me before. Allergies…? I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in… seventy years, maybe? I don't know. I don't remember much anymore. Is it dangerous? And what does it mean, “obstruction”? Is that… serious? My tummy feels so funny.
DOCTOR: Contrast dye is a liquid we sometimes use with X-rays to help us see things more clearly, Ms. McConnon. It’s injected into a vein, yes, and it’s generally very safe. The bee sting allergy is good to know, though. We'll make a note of that. Now, an “obstruction” means something is blocking your intestine, preventing things from moving through normally. It can be serious, which is why we need to investigate. That’s why I want to get the X-ray. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a major blockage, but we need to rule out anything concerning. The X-ray will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Are you able to get up and walk to the X-ray room?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blocking my intestine? That sounds… awful. Like being stuck, I suppose. Being stuck isn’t a good feeling, is it? Is it very painful? Will it hurt to get this… X-ray? And… walking? Well, I can walk, but I’m a little unsteady on my feet. I have to go very slowly. My knees aren’t what they used to be. I have a cane somewhere… But I can try, I suppose. If I have to. It’s just… everything feels so wobbly.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself shouldn't be painful, Ms. McConnon. It’s a quick and simple procedure. We'll have a technician help you, and you’ll be able to sit or lie down during it. We can take it very slowly. And yes, we will definitely use assistance getting you there and back. It’s important to be careful. “Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh… good. That’s good. I don’t like falling. I used to be very nimble, you know. A dancer, I was. But that was a lifetime ago. A nurse? Is something wrong? Will they have to… poke me? I don’t like needles much either. Everything feels so… delicate these days. My skin bruises so easily. But… if you think it's best, Doctor, then I’ll do whatever you need me to do. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Nurse Ramirez, this is Ms. McConnon. She's experiencing abdominal distension, tenderness, and diminished bowel sounds. I'm concerned about a possible obstruction, and I've ordered an abdominal X-ray and some blood work. Could you please assist her to the X-ray room and back, and make sure she's comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. An X-ray… yes, the Doctor explained. Everything feels so… confusing these days. And blood work? I don’t like having my blood taken. It makes me dizzy. But… if it will help, then I suppose I have to. Just… take it slow, please. And… be gentle. Everything feels so fragile. My bones ache, and my skin is so thin. I used to be very strong, you know. A farmer's daughter, I was. Always working hard. But that was a long, long time ago. Do you think I should bring my cane?
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. We'll take it as slow as you need to. We'll have you sit down for the blood draw, and I'm very good at finding veins, so it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. And yes, please bring your cane. Safety first. Let’s get you up slowly now. And don't worry, Dr. Deschane and I will make sure everything goes smoothly. I'll get your cane for you.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You're very kind. My knees are acting up today. It’s a bit of a struggle, you know. Old age… it's not for the faint of heart. It's good to have something to lean on. I used to be so nimble, you know. A dancer, I was. Always graceful, always light on my feet. But that was… a very long time ago. Are we going far? I hope I don't slow you down.
DOCTOR: Not at all, dear. We'll go at your pace. The X-ray room is just down the hall, a short walk. And I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't worry about slowing me down. We have all the time in the world. Do you feel comfortable walking this way?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. It’s a little wobbly, but manageable. It’s good of you to be so patient. Some people rush things, you know. They don’t understand what it’s like to be old. Everything feels so… heavy these days. Not just my body, but my mind too. I forget things so easily. It’s… unsettling. What was I saying? Oh… the heaviness. Yes. It's just… a lot. Do you think the X-ray will show anything? Are you worried?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel that way, dear. And you’re not alone. It’s very common to experience some memory changes as we get older. And don’t worry about forgetting things. It happens to the best of us. As for the X-ray, we're just trying to rule out anything serious. It's better to be safe than sorry. It doesn’t necessarily mean there's anything wrong. We'll know more once the images are developed. Dr. Deschane is very thorough, and she'll explain everything to you in detail. We’re almost there now. Just a few more steps.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good. It's good to know the Doctor is thorough. I like a Doctor who takes their time. Everything feels so… strange these days. My body doesn't feel like mine anymore. It aches and creaks and… forgets things. And my mind… it’s like a fog. Do you think… do you think it could be something serious? I don't want to… I don't want to be a burden to anyone. It’s just… I’ve lived a long life. A good life, I think. But… I don't want it to end badly.
DOCTOR: Oh, dear. It's alright to be scared, and it's perfectly okay to feel that way. But please don’t worry about being a burden. You’re not a burden to anyone. We’re here to take care of you, and we’ll do everything we can to make sure you’re comfortable and safe. We haven't even seen the X-ray results yet, so there's no need to jump to conclusions. Let’s focus on getting through this one step at a time. And remember, you've lived a long and full life, and that's something to be celebrated. Here we are. The technician will take good care of you. Just relax and follow their instructions. We'll be right here when you're finished.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, dear. You're very kind. It's good to have someone to talk to. It's… comforting. An X-ray… yes. I suppose I should go. I hope it doesn't take long. My knees are aching something terrible. Will you be right there? I don't want to be alone.
DOCTOR: I’ll be right outside, dear. I won't leave your side. Just tell the technician you're feeling a little anxious, and they'll be extra gentle. And I'll be right here waiting for you when you're finished. You can do this. Just take a deep breath and focus on relaxing. We’re here for you, every step of the way. Go ahead, dear. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, dear. I… I’m a little nervous. And my knees are aching. Could you… could you be gentle? I hope this doesn’t take long. .
