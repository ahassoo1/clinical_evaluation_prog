DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s…different than usual. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s enough to make me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing it up – changes can be a sign of something, and it's always best to check it out. Can you describe what you mean by “different”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It’s not…sweeter, exactly. And it’s not worse, not really. It’s just…off. Like a different kind of smell altogether. I usually just smell…like, well, me, you know? Normal body smell. But this is…almost musky? And it seems to come on quicker, even if I haven’t been doing anything particularly strenuous. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A change in odor, even if it’s not necessarily stronger, is definitely worth investigating. And the fact that it's appearing more quickly is also good to know. Let's start with a little background. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. Not really, not that I can think of. My appetite’s been pretty normal, maybe a little less than usual, but I haven’t been eating as much red meat lately. And I’ve been sleeping okay, though I do wake up a couple of times during the night. Oh! And my husband – well, ex-husband – he moved out about six months ago. That’s been…stressful, I guess. But other than that, I feel pretty much the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Stress can definitely contribute to changes in body odor, but we want to rule out anything else. Now, have you started using any new soaps, deodorants, or detergents recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I’ve been using the same things for years, actually. Dove soap and a pretty basic deodorant – the kind you just roll on. And I always use the same laundry detergent, too – Tide. I don’t really like switching things up, you know? Keeps things simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. And I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was…oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now! Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I'm on Medicare, so they’d know if anything serious was going on, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare would definitely have records of anything significant. But it's always good to get a full picture. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take pretty much any medicine. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! Is this going to be a long appointment, Doctor? I do have a floor to finish up later today.
DOCTOR: Not too long, Kerriann. Just want to get a bit more information and do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t really feel the need for supplements. And I don’t get sick very often, so I rarely take anything over-the-counter. Honestly, I'm pretty good about avoiding medication whenever I can. Is a physical exam going to involve blood tests? I don’t really like needles.
DOCTOR: It might involve blood tests, Kerriann, depending on what I find during the exam. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s just do a quick check of your vital signs and a brief physical exam. First, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please sit up on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Just let me know if you do need to take blood. I just get a little…nervous, that’s all. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to stay still.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds normal there. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but that could be due to being in the office. Any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt at all. Just feels like…pressure, maybe? But no pain. I do feel a little warm, now that you mention it. But I was walking pretty quickly to get here, you know, trying to be on time. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: That could explain it. Now, let me just check your thyroid. Any discomfort here at all?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't feel bad. It's just...a little strange, having someone touch my neck. It doesn't hurt, though. Is everything okay, Doctor? You seem a little…focused.
DOCTOR: It’s just… I’m noting a slight asymmetry in your thyroid. It’s subtle, but it warrants further investigation. And you mentioned the change in body odor. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a thyroid panel and a complete blood count. It's routine, and will give us a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That sounds…serious. Is it something bad? I thought you said it was subtle. What does “asymmetry” mean, exactly? And what will the blood tests tell you? I really don’t like needles, Doctor. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Kerriann. Asymmetry just means one side is slightly different than the other. It can be normal, but it’s best to rule out anything concerning. The blood tests will check your thyroid hormone levels, to see if it’s functioning properly, and the complete blood count will check for any other underlying issues. We’re just being thorough. The blood draw is quick. Honestly. A small pinch. And it will give us a lot of information. Would you prefer I have the nurse draw it, she's very gentle?
PATIENT: Okay. If the nurse is gentle, that would be…better, yes. I just get anxious, that's all. And if it's not serious, that’s good to hear. So, what happens after the blood tests? Do I have to come back? And will you tell me everything right away, or will I have to wait for results? I really do appreciate you taking the time to look into this, Doctor. It’s been worrying me a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood right away. The results should be back in a couple of days. I'll review them as soon as they’re available and call you with the findings. It's likely nothing serious, Kerriann, but it's always best to be certain. If anything is concerning, we’ll discuss it in detail and create a plan. I’ll also give you a copy of the lab requisition in case you want to track the results yourself. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I’ll just go wait for the nurse, then. I appreciate your patience. It's silly, I know, worrying over a little body odor… but it just didn't feel right.
DOCTOR: It's never silly to trust your instincts, Kerriann. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. .
