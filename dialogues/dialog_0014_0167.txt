DOCTOR: Hmm, Mr. Stoegbauer, 87 years young. Alright. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been… troublesome. A sore, mostly. On my foot. It hurts to walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot, causing pain with walking… Alright. And how long has this sore been…troublesome, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, maybe… three, four weeks ago? It didn’t hurt much at first, just a little red spot. But it’s gotten bigger and more painful since then. I try to keep it clean, but it doesn’t seem to get better.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks… Okay. And can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… round-ish. Not a nice shape, but round-ish. And it’s… open. Not covered with skin. And a little bit… smelly, if I’m honest. I’ve been putting bandages on it, but they get… dirty quickly. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Open sore, bottom of the foot near the toes… and you said it’s smelly. Right. Have you noticed any drainage from it?
PATIENT: Drainage? Oh… yes. A little bit. It’s… clear-ish, sometimes a little bit yellow. Not a lot, but enough to make the bandage not so clean. I try to change it every day, but… my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Clear or yellowish drainage… Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or redness spreading around the sore?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. And no chills. The redness… well, there is some redness around it, yes. But it hasn’t spread much. It stays mostly right around the sore. It's just… red. And a little swollen, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, localized redness and swelling… Have you had any problems with diabetes or poor circulation in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me, many years ago, I have… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that’s it. And my legs… they get cold easily. Sometimes they feel… numb. And I have trouble feeling my feet sometimes, you know? Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diabetes and issues with circulation and sensation in your feet… This is important. Now, I'm going to need to take a look at your foot. Could you please sit back in the chair and lift your leg so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Be careful, please. It’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore here, near the base of your fifth toe. It’s… ulcerated, as I suspected. There’s some surrounding erythema, and it does appear to be draining slightly. Your pulses are diminished, but present. And sensation… is reduced in this area. Mr. Stoegbauer, this looks like a diabetic foot ulcer. Given your history of diabetes and reduced circulation, it's important to address this quickly. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar and assess for any infection. We’ll also need to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests and an X-ray? Is it very bad, Doctor? I just want to be able to walk again without pain.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Stoegbauer, it’s not ideal, certainly. But we caught it. And, frankly, given your age and history, this was… predictable. The blood tests will tell us how well controlled your diabetes is, and the X-ray will help us determine if the infection has spread to the bone. We need to know the extent of the problem before we can determine the best course of action. It could be as simple as antibiotics and careful wound care, or it might require more aggressive treatment. Now, I'm going to send you to the lab for bloodwork and then to radiology for the X-ray. Don't worry, we'll get this sorted out. But you must follow all instructions carefully. And try to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Predictable, you say? I try to take care of myself, Doctor. But… yes, I understand. Blood tests and X-ray. And keep weight off my foot. Can someone help me get to the lab? I’m not so good at walking these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’ll have one of the nurses escort you to the lab and radiology. Just sit tight for a moment, and I’ll let her know. It’s important to remember that managing diabetes is… challenging, and requires diligence. And, frankly, earlier intervention often yields better results. Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Stoegbauer with his lab work and X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ll try to be diligent. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just remember to follow up with me after you’ve had your tests done. And, if you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever, come back immediately. We need to stay on top of this. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will try… thank you.
