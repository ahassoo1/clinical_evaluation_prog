DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. It's Dr. Pirl. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I have been... how you say... wheezing. It is not good. It happens when I walk, mostly. And sometimes at night. It makes it hard to breathe, a little.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, you say. And it's brought on by walking, primarily, and occasionally at night. Hmm. Could you describe the wheezing for me, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: It is like... a whistle, Doctor. A small whistle, but inside my chest. When I breathe out, I hear it. Not always, but when it is bad, yes. It is scary, a little. I do not like it. It feels… tight, too. Like a band around my chest.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound on exhalation… and a tightness in your chest. I understand. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Maybe… two months now? It started slowly, just after a long walk with my grandchildren. I thought it was just being old! But it is not going away. It gets worse some days, better others. But it is always there, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Two months… okay. And has anything specific seemed to make it worse, besides walking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Dust, maybe? When I clean, it is bad. And… cold air. When I go outside in the morning, if it is chilly, it bothers it. Not every time, but often. And sometimes… flowers. Very strong smells, you know?
DOCTOR: Dust, cold air, strong smells… alright. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs, if you don’t mind. Would you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Deep breaths… like this? I try to breathe slow, like you say. Is this good?
DOCTOR: Okay. I do hear some wheezing, as you described, particularly on exhalation. It’s… bilateral, meaning both sides. And I also notice a slight… diminished air entry in the lower lobes. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Asthma… COPD… No, Doctor. I do not think so. The doctors back home… they just told me to stay active. I have always been very healthy. I walk every day, I eat good food. I do not smoke, never have. I think it is just… old age, maybe? But it worries me. I do not want to stop walking!
DOCTOR: It's good you've been so active, Mrs. Kilton, and that you haven't smoked. While it's possible this is simply age-related, the wheezing and diminished air entry warrant further investigation. I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, pneumonia, perhaps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Last winter, I had a bad cold. Very stuffy nose, cough. I stayed in bed for a week. The doctor gave me something for it. But that was… last December, I think. I have not been sick since. Nothing serious, anyway. Just a little tired sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A cold last December… okay. And beyond that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. I have always been strong. I had my babies at home, no trouble. I broke my arm once, when I was a little girl, but that is all. I go to the doctor for check-ups every year, but he always says I am very healthy. This… this is new. I worry it is something bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Just vitamins. A little bit of Vitamin D, because I do not see the sun much. And sometimes, a little something for my bones. But that is all. Nothing for my chest, nothing for breathing. I do not like to take pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I eat everything. I touch everything. Flowers, dust, cats… sometimes I sneeze, but I do not have a bad reaction. My grandchildren have cats, and I am fine with them. I do not get hives, I do not get itchy. Nothing. I am very lucky, I think. Usually. This breathing… this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your symptoms and history, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test – that's a breathing test – to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will help us determine the cause of your wheezing and diminished air entry. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… a breathing test… Yes, Doctor. That sounds alright. If it will help. I want to know what is wrong. And I want to be able to walk again without… whistling. When do we do these tests? And will they take long? I have to pick up my grandchildren later.
DOCTOR: The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, it should only take a few minutes. The pulmonary function test will take a little longer, perhaps 20-30 minutes. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… Yes, that should be alright. I can ask my daughter to pick up the grandchildren. They understand. Twenty to thirty minutes… that is not too long. And will I know the results quickly? I worry a lot, Doctor.
DOCTOR: We should have the results of the X-ray within a few hours, and the pulmonary function test results within a day or two. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of an inhaler – a bronchodilator – to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. It's safe to use, and it may provide some immediate relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An inhaler… to help me breathe… Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. If it will help, yes. I trust you. What does it do, exactly? And how do I use it? I have never used one before. I worry I will do it wrong.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs, which helps to relax the muscles and open up your airways, making it easier to breathe. You’ll want to shake it well before each use. Then, you’ll take a deep breath and exhale completely. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and press down on the canister while continuing to inhale slowly and deeply. Hold your breath for a few seconds, then exhale. We will have the nurse go over the correct technique with you before you leave. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Shake it, breathe out, put it in my mouth, press down while breathing in, hold it… It sounds… complicated, but I will try. The nurse will help me, yes? I do not want to do it wrong and not get any air.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse is excellent and will go through it step-by-step with you. She’ll make sure you feel comfortable using it before you leave. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for the inhaler, and we’ll get the nurse to come in and show you how to use it. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything. I worry, of course, but I trust you to help me. Thank you for seeing me. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I hope the inhaler works. I want to keep walking with my grandchildren.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. We’ll do everything we can to get you back to enjoying your walks. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Let's get you scheduled for those tests first.
