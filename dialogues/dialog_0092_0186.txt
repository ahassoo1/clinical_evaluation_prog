DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need a check-up, you know? Gotta make sure I'm still good to go. It's a bit of a long drive out here, so let's get this done, eh?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. That’s a good idea – preventative care is always important, especially with a new physical activity like trying out for a team. To get a better understanding of what we need to cover today, could you tell me a little more about the team you’re trying out for, and what kind of physical activity is involved?
PATIENT: It's… well, it's a wrestling team. Not professional, just a local thing. Mostly grappling, you know? Throwing people around, being thrown around. It’s been a while since I did anything like this, honestly. Mostly just stayed in shape, hiking and stuff. Nothing too strenuous. Is that what you need to know? I’m not really good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Lamark. Wrestling is quite physically demanding. Knowing it’s been a while since you’ve done anything this strenuous is good to know as well. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for check-ups?
PATIENT: Not really. I… usually just avoid the doctor if I can. Never had much luck with them, to be honest. Mostly just deal with things myself. I haven’t been to one in… oh, I don't know, maybe ten years? More? I'm pretty healthy, though. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Lamark. We’ll take things at your pace. Since it’s been some time since your last check-up, let’s try to get a good overview today. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Never had any of those problems. I mean, I get a little winded sometimes, but that's just from hiking at altitude. And my knees sometimes ache a bit after a long walk. But that's just old age, I guess. I'm 62, you know? Things start to creak a little.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It's common for joints to experience some discomfort with age and activity. We'll definitely take a closer look at your knees today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Broken a few bones when I was a kid, playing around, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a hospital or anything like that. Just a few casts, that’s all. A sprained ankle here and there, but nothing major. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I heal quick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Lamark. It sounds like you've been quite resilient over the years. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. Don't take any pills, vitamins, nothing. I try to eat healthy, that’s all. I figure if you eat right, you don’t need any of that stuff. I drink a lot of water, too. That's important, right? Is that something you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Lamark. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. And yes, staying hydrated is crucial. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty sure. Maybe a little itchy sometimes after being bitten by a mosquito, but that’s it. Nothing serious. Can we get this over with? I’ve got a long drive home.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Alright, Lamark. We've covered a lot of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief look at your joints – especially your knees, since you mentioned some discomfort. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, fine. Get it over with. The sooner we start, the sooner I can leave. Just… don't poke around too much, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be. You said blood pressure? Is that bad? I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lamark. We’ll be gentle. Checking your blood pressure is just a routine part of the exam, it helps us get a baseline of your overall health. It’s not necessarily an indication of anything being wrong, just a standard measurement. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. Please lie back and relax as much as possible. Okay, everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. It'll just be a quick squeeze on your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 152 over 98. We’ll need to discuss that further. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Could you bend them one at a time, and let me know if you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? I don't like the sound of that. Okay, knees… Ouch. Yeah, that's a bit sore. Not terrible, but… yeah. It's been like that for a while. That one's a bit worse. Definitely a bit of a pain there. It clicks a lot, too. Like… Hear that? It's always done that. Is that… is that serious?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear the clicking, and I feel some crepitus – that’s the grinding sensation – in both knees. There’s also a bit of tenderness when I press here and here. It sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in both knees. It’s a common condition, especially with age and activity. It causes the cartilage in your joints to break down, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. The elevated blood pressure is something we need to address as well, as it can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't try out for the wrestling team, but we'll need to work on managing your knee pain and getting your blood pressure under control. Would you be open to discussing some treatment options for both of these conditions?
PATIENT: Treatment options? Like… pills? I told you, I don't like pills. Is there anything else? Like… stretches? Or… I don’t know. I just want to be able to wrestle. And I don’t want to spend a fortune on this. I’m retired, you know? And this blood pressure thing… is it serious right now? Can I just… ignore it? Look, I've been fine for 62 years, why fix something that isn't broken? Can't I just… wrap my knees? Is that an option?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lamark. You're right, we don't want to jump to pills if we don't need to. And you’re right to ask about non-medication options. For your knees, wrapping them can provide some support and stability, but it won't address the underlying osteoarthritis. Physical therapy with targeted stretches and strengthening exercises is a much better approach. It can help improve your range of motion, reduce pain, and strengthen the muscles around your knees, offering long-term relief. I can write you a referral to a physical therapist specializing in joint pain. As for your blood pressure, it’s elevated, and while you may feel fine now, consistently high blood pressure is a significant risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. It’s not something to ignore, even if you're currently asymptomatic. There are lifestyle modifications we can try – reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium, regular exercise, and managing stress – which can often help lower blood pressure. We can monitor your blood pressure regularly to see how these changes affect it. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, we can discuss medication options, but that would be a last resort. Would you be open to trying these lifestyle modifications and seeing a physical therapist?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Lifestyle changes… I guess I can try to eat less salt. And the physical therapy… as long as it doesn’t cost too much. And it doesn’t take up all my time. I've got things to do, you know? I don’t want to spend every day in some clinic. Can you just… write the referrals? Let’s get this over with. The sooner I start, the sooner I can get back to… well, the sooner I can see if I can wrestle. Are we done here? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lamark. I understand. Here are the referrals to a physical therapist and a list of resources for managing high blood pressure. The physical therapist will assess your knees and develop a personalized treatment plan. I’ve also included information on low-sodium diets and stress management techniques. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me in one month to discuss your progress with the physical therapy and monitor your blood pressure. It’s important to track your numbers and see if the lifestyle changes are making a difference. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s it. Just… thanks, I guess. I really need to get going now. Long drive. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. Drive safely. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
