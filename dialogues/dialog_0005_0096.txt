DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doc. Well, it's… it's kinda strange, actually. My eyes have been really bothering me in the sun. Like, really bothering. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's getting worse. It's not pain, exactly… more like everything's super bright and uncomfortable. It makes me want to squint all the time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Brightness and discomfort in the sun, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. And it's not just, like, a normal squint-because-it's-bright kinda thing. It feels… deeper? Hard to explain. Like the light is actually hurting my eyes, even with sunglasses on sometimes. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I lost my wife a couple years ago, and I don't want to lose my sight too. Sorry, that probably sounds dramatic.
DOCTOR: It’s not dramatic to be concerned about your vision. Losing your wife… well, that’s certainly a lot to deal with. But we’ll figure out what’s going on with your eyes. Let's start with a few questions. When you say “a few weeks,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started right around the end of June, maybe the first week. It was gradual at first, just a little more sensitive than usual. But the last couple of weeks, it’s definitely gotten worse. Like, I really have to avoid being outside during the brightest part of the day. It's been hard, I enjoy gardening, you know?
DOCTOR: Gardening, right. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the brightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really pain, like I said. But sometimes my eyes feel gritty, even when they’re closed. And I’ve been blinking a lot more, trying to… I don’t know, clear things up? It doesn't really help, though. Oh! And maybe a little bit of redness sometimes, but I thought that was just from the sun. It's hard to tell. I’m not good at noticing these things, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gritty feeling, increased blinking, possible redness… Okay. Now, have you had any changes in your vision otherwise?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks normal, as far as I can tell. No blurry spots or anything like that. Just… really bothered by the light. I can still see just fine, I think. I haven't needed to change my glasses prescription or anything. Actually, now that you mention it, maybe things look a little faded sometimes, but I figured that was just because of my age. I'm 32, right? Are things supposed to change at 32?
DOCTOR: 32 is still young, things shouldn’t be changing drastically. But everyone's different. Let’s get a proper look. I'm going to do a quick eye exam. Just look straight ahead, and I’ll ask you to focus on different things. It won’t take long. Do you wear contacts?
PATIENT: No, no contacts. Just glasses for reading, sometimes. I mostly need them for close-up work, like when I’m fixing things. Not for driving or anything. Is that important? I'm a bit worried about this whole thing, Doc. It's just...my wife, she always took care of these things, and now...well. I'm just not sure what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Komarov. We'll figure this out. The glasses are relevant, yes. Let's start with checking your visual acuity. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Sure, sure. Okay… um… E… C… H… P… F… V… Is that right? I think so. It's a little blurry, even with my glasses on. Should it be blurry? I’m really not good at this, Doc. Maybe I need a stronger prescription?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s check your left eye now. Cover your right eye with your hand. And tell me what you see on this line…
PATIENT: Okay, covering my right eye… Um… it's… definitely blurry. Like, really blurry. I can kinda make out shapes, but not the letters. Is that bad? I'm starting to get a bit worried, Doc. My wife always said I had good eyesight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your visual acuity is a bit reduced in both eyes, more so in your left. And there's some mild redness and dryness, as you mentioned. I'm going to check your intraocular pressure to rule out anything more serious. It's a quick test, just a little puff of air in each eye. Don't blink.
PATIENT: Okay… a puff of air? That sounds… not very pleasant. But if you think it's important, then do whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… try to be quick, okay? My eyes are already feeling sensitive. I really don't like doctors’ offices. My wife used to handle all this, she was so brave. I just… I get nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your intraocular pressure is within normal limits. Now, let's take a look inside your eyes with the ophthalmoscope. This will let me see your retina and optic nerve. It's not painful, just a bright light. Don't look directly at the light.
PATIENT: Okay… bright light, don't look directly… It's kinda… uncomfortable. I'm seeing spots, Doc. Is that normal? I'm really trying to cooperate, but my eyes are just… being difficult. I just want to know what's wrong, Doc. I'm getting really anxious here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Everything appears normal back there. No significant abnormalities. The redness and dryness are likely contributing to your discomfort, and the reduced visual acuity could be due to a simple refractive error – meaning you might need a stronger glasses prescription. However, given your symptoms—the brightness sensitivity, the gritty feeling—and your history, I want to be cautious. It could be early signs of pterygium—a growth on the conjunctiva—or even a very mild form of uveitis—inflammation inside the eye. We can't be certain without further testing. I'm going to prescribe you some artificial tears to help with the dryness and discomfort. I also want you to see an ophthalmologist—an eye specialist—for a more comprehensive evaluation. They'll be able to do a proper slit-lamp exam and rule out anything more serious. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s… a lot. Pterygium? Uveitis? Those sound… scary. So you don’t know what it is, exactly? Just that it could be one of those things? And an ophthalmologist… is that another appointment? Another doctor? My wife… she always knew what to do. What does a slit-lamp exam even do? Is it painful? And how soon do I need to see this other doctor? I’m kinda scared, Doc. I just want my eyes to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Let’s take this one step at a time. Pterygium is a common growth on the surface of the eye, often caused by sun exposure. It's usually not serious, but it can be irritating. Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye, which can be more serious if left untreated, but it's also treatable. That's why I want you to see the specialist. A slit-lamp exam is a painless procedure. The doctor will use a microscope with a bright light to examine the structures of your eye in detail. It doesn't involve any needles or injections. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed – she's a very good ophthalmologist here in the city. I recommend you schedule an appointment as soon as possible—within the next week or two—just to be on the safe side. I'll also prescribe these artificial tears – use them four times a day to help keep your eyes lubricated. Look, I understand you're anxious. But we're being cautious here. It’s better to rule things out than to wait and see. Do you have any questions about scheduling the appointment or using the eye drops?
PATIENT: Okay… Dr. Evelyn Reed… I'll write that down. Within the next two weeks… alright. I can do that. And four times a day with the drops… I think I can remember that. What if… what if it is something serious? What if I… lose my sight? I know it’s silly to ask, but… I just… I don't know what I'd do. My wife… she always told me everything would be alright.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov. Let's not jump to conclusions. It's unlikely to be anything serious. But you’re right to be concerned, and that’s why we’re getting you to a specialist. If it is something that requires treatment, there are many options available. Modern ophthalmology has made great strides in treating eye conditions. I understand losing your wife is still very difficult, and I can appreciate you’re feeling anxious. But we’re taking the necessary steps to ensure your vision is protected. Focus on scheduling the appointment with Dr. Reed, use the eye drops as prescribed, and try not to worry unnecessarily. We’ll know more once she’s had a chance to examine your eyes. Do you need help finding Dr. Reed’s contact information or scheduling the appointment?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I can find it online. I'm okay. Thank you, Doc. For everything. I… I still feel scared, but… I guess I'll just… try to stay positive. And I'll schedule that appointment right away. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I really do. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Komarov. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day. .
