DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's August 2nd. I see here you're 39 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Yes, 39 is correct. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have… too much gas. It is very frequent, and… uncomfortable. I am hoping you can help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Goodstein. It's certainly not uncommon to experience digestive discomfort, and there's no need to be embarrassed. Frequent gas can be quite bothersome. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It happens… almost every day. Several times a day, really. It doesn’t matter when – after breakfast, lunch, dinner… sometimes even in between. And it is… loud. Very loud. Also, sometimes my stomach feels… bloated and full, even when I have not eaten much. It is not painful, exactly, but it is… a pressure. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Frequent, loud gas and a feeling of bloating, regardless of when you eat… and you say it's not painful, but a pressure sensation. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: That is a good question. I think… gradually. It was not suddenly bad. Maybe… six months ago, it started being a little more frequent. Then, over the last few months, it has gotten… worse and worse. I did not pay much attention at first, but now it is… difficult to ignore.
DOCTOR: Six months of gradual worsening… that's helpful information. Now, let's talk about what you've been eating. Have you noticed any specific foods that seem to trigger the gas or bloating?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is difficult. I eat… fairly simple things. I like… chicken, potatoes, vegetables. I do have bread sometimes, but not a lot. I drink… water mostly. I do not think any one food makes it worse, specifically. It seems to happen no matter what I eat. Perhaps… maybe beans? I had beans last week and… yes, it was a little worse that day. But not always, even when I eat beans. It is… confusing.
DOCTOR: So, generally a fairly simple diet – chicken, potatoes, vegetables – and you suspect beans might be a trigger, but it's not consistent. Okay. And how about any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… you mean… going to the bathroom? It is… regular. I go… every day. It is not diarrhea, or constipation. Just… normal. Sometimes, when I have the gas, I feel the need to go, but it is not always… successful. Just… air. A lot of air.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular bowel movements, not diarrhea or constipation, but a feeling of needing to pass gas, and primarily passing air. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I have never been diagnosed with anything, really. I have not been to the doctor much. Just… the usual check-ups when I was a child. I do not have any allergies that I know of. I take no medications.
DOCTOR: No prior medical diagnoses, no allergies, and no current medications. That's good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother… she had some stomach problems sometimes. Not like this, though. More… heartburn, and indigestion. My father… he was healthy, very healthy. He did not have any problems. My sister… she is fine, as far as I know. No one in my family has had… this much gas, before. I do not think. It is hard to remember, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of heartburn in your mother, but no similar digestive issues in your father or sister. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or do you have any significant stress in your life?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I do not drink alcohol. Never have. Stress… yes, I suppose. I work at the fast food restaurant, you know? It can be… busy. Sometimes the customers are… difficult. But I do not think it is that much stress. I try to… relax, when I am not working. I enjoy reading, and… walking in the park.
DOCTOR: No smoking, no alcohol, some stress from work, but you have hobbies to help you relax. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I am happy to do whatever you need. Just… please be gentle?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Goodstein. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm listening to your abdomen now. I hear normal bowel sounds, perhaps a little bit more activity than usual, but nothing concerning at this point. And I'm feeling your abdomen. It's soft, and I don't detect any significant tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That does not hurt. Just… pressure, like usual. It feels… normal. Like you said, just a little bit… full. Not painful, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness, just some fullness. Based on what you've told me – the gradual onset, the lack of alarm symptoms like weight loss, fever, or blood in your stool, and the physical exam findings – it sounds like you're likely experiencing functional bloating and excessive gas. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. A complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall organ function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests are fine. I want to know what is wrong, you know? Will the blood tests… show something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you want to get to the bottom of this, Mr. Goodstein. The blood tests are primarily to rule out any serious underlying causes, which, based on everything we’ve discussed, is unlikely. They’re a standard precaution. We’ll check for things like celiac disease, thyroid issues, and other potential causes of digestive symptoms. It's very likely they will come back normal. In the meantime, while we await the results, there are some things you can try to manage your symptoms. Have you ever considered keeping a food diary to see if you can identify any specific triggers?
PATIENT: Okay, that is… good to know. If they are just to rule things out, that is fine. A food diary… no, I have not. But… I suppose I could try. It sounds like a lot of work, though. I would have to write down everything I eat?
DOCTOR: Yes, ideally everything you eat and drink, as well as any symptoms you experience afterward. It can be a bit tedious, but it can be surprisingly helpful in identifying patterns. You can also try over-the-counter remedies like simethicone, which can help reduce gas bubbles, or activated charcoal, which may help absorb excess gas. However, those are just temporary measures. Another thing to consider is eating slower and avoiding carbonated beverages. These can both contribute to gas buildup. I’m also going to give you a handout with some general dietary recommendations for managing bloating and gas. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Eating slower… yes, I suppose I do eat quickly sometimes. And I do like fizzy drinks. I will try to avoid those. Simethicone… I think I have heard of that. Is it safe? And… how long will it take to get the blood test results?
DOCTOR: Simethicone is very safe, Mr. Goodstein. It’s not absorbed into the bloodstream, so it doesn’t have any significant side effects. You can find it over-the-counter at most pharmacies. As for the blood test results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for them to come back. Our office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all for now. Thank you very much for your help. I feel… a little better, knowing what might be wrong, and what to look out for. I will try the food diary, and avoid the fizzy drinks. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
