DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do. It’s my stomach. It’s been…bad. Really bad. Nothing’s stopping it, and I’m tired of being stuck inside.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can definitely get to the bottom of this. “Bad” can mean a lot of things, though, so let's try to narrow it down a bit. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really keep track of dates. It feels like weeks, maybe a month? It started gradually, just a little off, and then got worse and worse. Like a faucet that wouldn't turn off. Is that…helpful? I don’t see how knowing exactly when it started is going to fix it.
DOCTOR: You're right to question that! It's more about getting a sense of how long it's been bothering you. A month…okay. And you mentioned it started gradually. Can you describe what “a little off” felt like at first?
PATIENT: Ugh, it was just…rumbling. Like normal stomach noises, but more. And then I was going to the bathroom more often. Not diarrhea diarrhea, just…frequent. Then it just escalated. Look, I’m not going to sit here and give you a play-by-play of my bowel movements, okay? It’s embarrassing enough as it is. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no need for a play-by-play! I understand. Frequent trips to the bathroom…and it’s gotten worse from there. So, it started with increased frequency, and what’s it like now?
PATIENT: Now? Now it’s…constant. I barely leave the house. I'm lucky if I can make it through a commercial break without having to run to the bathroom. It's…watery. And it doesn't feel right, if that makes sense. Crampy, too. Really crampy. I’ve tried…I don't know, everything the pharmacy suggests. Nothing helps.
DOCTOR: Constant, watery, and crampy…that sounds incredibly unpleasant, Ms. Woodring. You mentioned trying things from the pharmacy. Do you remember what those were?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes. That pink stuff, Imodium, I think? And…something for the cramping. Lomotil? It all just sits in the cupboard now. Waste of money. Honestly, I’m starting to think this is just…something I’m stuck with. My mother always said some things just don't get better. She wasn't wrong much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it’s good you tried those over-the-counter medications. Loperamide and… Lomotil, yes. Those can be helpful for some people, but they don’t work for everyone. And it sounds like they haven’t been working for you. We need to figure out what’s going on here, and just accepting it isn’t the answer. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Not…that I’ve seen. Look, I don't spend a lot of time looking at what comes out, if you don't mind. It's bad enough dealing with it, let alone inspecting it. It’s just…watery and…well, you know. Is this going to be a long appointment? I really need to get back to…things.
DOCTOR: No, I completely understand. We’ll get through this as efficiently as possible. Not spending time inspecting things is perfectly reasonable. Okay. Have you had a fever, or been feeling nauseous or vomiting at all with this?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting, thankfully. I get a little queasy sometimes, just before…you know. But I haven't actually thrown up. It’s mostly just…exhaustion. Being stuck on the toilet all day is tiring, okay? It wears you down. And I’m starting to get dehydrated, I think. My mouth feels…dry.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Dehydration is definitely a concern with this kind of situation. Okay, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and take your pulse just to get a baseline. Then, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. I really don’t like being poked and prodded. And please be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Okay. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, mostly in the lower quadrants. I don’t feel any masses, and there’s no significant guarding, which is good. Your pulse is a little elevated, which is understandable given the dehydration and constant discomfort. Now, just to rule some things out, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Ugh, let me think. Not really. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago. And…my gallbladder. They took it out, must be fifteen years ago now. Other than that…no. I eat okay, I guess. Nothing fancy. And I don’t drink or smoke. I was married, but…my husband passed away a few years back. Does that count as a condition?
DOCTOR: No, your husband’s passing is not a medical condition, Ms. Woodring, but I'm very sorry for your loss. Pneumonia and gallbladder removal…okay. And no other major medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve taken plenty of pills in my life, and nothing’s ever reacted badly. Except…maybe that pink stuff, Imodium? It didn’t help, but I didn’t break out in hives or anything. Honestly, I just feel…sick all the time. That's the biggest reaction I have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and the Imodium didn't cause an allergic reaction. It sounds like it just didn't provide relief. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, or have you recently taken any antibiotics?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They never do anything good. And no antibiotics. I haven’t been sick enough to need antibiotics in years. Look, is this getting somewhere? Because honestly, I’m starting to feel like you’re just asking questions to fill time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. I apologize if it feels like I'm just asking questions. It's important for me to get a complete picture of your health to figure out what's going on. We are getting somewhere. Given your symptoms – the constant watery stools, cramping, dehydration, and lack of response to over-the-counter medications, and with no recent antibiotic use, it could be a few things. It’s possible you have a viral gastroenteritis – a stomach bug. However, given the duration and severity, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a parasitic infection or Inflammatory Bowel Disease. To do that, I'd like to order a stool sample test. It’s a simple test, you'll just need to collect a small sample, and the lab will analyze it. I also want to do a blood test to check your electrolyte levels and look for any signs of inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Fine. Whatever. Just…tell me where to go and what to do. The quicker I get this over with, the better. I don’t want to spend my whole life in doctor’s offices. And I want results, quickly. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll have the nurse give you the collection kits and instructions for the stool sample and blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. I’ll call you as soon as the results are back, hopefully within a few days. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated. Try to drink small sips of water frequently, even if you don’t feel thirsty. And avoid anything that might upset your stomach, like dairy, greasy foods, or caffeine. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a fever, see blood in your stool, or become unable to keep fluids down – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I know this is frustrating, Ms. Woodring, and I’m doing everything I can to get you a diagnosis and treatment plan. .
