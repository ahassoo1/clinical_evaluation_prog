DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… alright. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary, but my wife – God rest her soul – would be having a fit if I didn’t get this checked. It’s this bruising. I’ve been on blood thinners for a while now, and I’ve noticed… well, I bruise very easily lately. More than usual, even for being on the medication. It's getting ridiculous, frankly. I bumped into the coffee table – just a little bump – and ended up looking like I’d gone a few rounds with a boxer.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Farson. It's good you're taking this seriously, and it sounds concerning that you're noticing increased bruising despite being on blood thinners already. We certainly want to investigate that. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, not like a single incident. Probably… oh, I’d say about a month ago? Maybe six weeks? It started with little things, you know? A slightly darker spot where I’d lean my arm on the desk. Then it started happening more frequently. Now, like I said, a tiny knock and I look like a plum. It's quite bothersome, and I'm a bit worried, if I’m honest. I do try to be careful, but one can't live in a bubble, can one?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. A month to six weeks of progressively worsening bruising is helpful information. And it’s good you’ve noticed it's getting more frequent. Now, could you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… bruises. What do you want me to say? They start off red, then purple, then… you know, the usual colours. They’re not particularly painful, just… noticeable. And they seem to take a long time to fade. Longer than they used to, I think. They’re not huge, mind you, but they’re spreading. I've got one on my forearm now, and another starting on my shin, just from… well, I can't even remember what I did. I wasn't even doing anything strenuous. Honestly, it's making me question if the dosage is right. Perhaps it's too high?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Farson, and something we’ll definitely look into. The progression of color changes and the increased time to fade are both important details. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you mind if I ask some questions about that?
PATIENT: Go ahead. Though I warn you, I’ve seen a lot of doctors in my time, and I’m sure you’ve got all this information already. It's all in your system, isn’t it? Still, ask away. As long as it's not too… complicated. I don’t have time for a lot of medical jargon.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Farson. While we do have some information in our system, it’s always best to confirm and get a complete picture from you directly. It helps me understand your specific situation better. And I promise to avoid the jargon as much as possible. First, can you tell me what condition you're currently taking blood thinners for?
PATIENT: Well, it was a… a heart thing. Atrial fibrillation, that's what they called it. Irregular heartbeat. Very unpleasant. They said I was at risk of… clots. And strokes. So they put me on warfarin, I believe. That’s the name of the medication, right? It was a few years ago now, and honestly, I don’t pay close attention to all the details. Just take the pills, that’s what I always say. They monitor me regularly, or at least they used to. I suppose I should ask more questions, but I never have the patience for it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. Atrial fibrillation is a common reason for starting blood thinners, and warfarin is a frequently prescribed medication for it. It’s good that you’re being monitored. And just to confirm – have there been any changes to your warfarin dosage recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. About two months ago, my primary care doctor, Dr. Ramirez, she increased the dosage. Said my levels were a little low. She said it was a small adjustment, but… that might be when I started noticing this bruising, come to think of it. I can’t be certain, of course, but it’s possible. Honestly, that woman… she rushes through everything. Barely looks at you. I doubt she even remembers increasing the dosage.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Farson. That timing is very relevant. A dosage change two months ago coinciding with the onset of increased bruising is a significant clue. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms – things like bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, or any unusual fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Well… no nosebleeds, thankfully. And I haven’t checked my… stool. That’s a bit personal, don’t you think? No, nothing like that. I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, now that you mention it. Just a general feeling of… being run down. I put it down to my age, to be honest. And the heat. It's been awfully hot this summer. But perhaps it’s related. It's hard to say, isn’t it? Everything feels a bit… off, lately. But I wouldn’t say it’s anything dramatic. Just a bit sluggish.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to articulate that, Mr. Farson. The increased fatigue is worth noting, even if it seems subtle. Now, let's talk about your past medical history a little further. Have you had any other significant medical conditions or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was routine. And I broke my arm once, skiing. Nothing too serious. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago. A nasty business, that was. But otherwise… no, not much. I've been fairly healthy, all things considered. I’ve always tried to eat well, even though I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner. And I used to exercise regularly, but that’s been… less frequent lately. Doctor Ramirez would probably be disappointed.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. And don’t worry about Dr. Ramirez. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the warfarin?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take a statin for cholesterol. Doctor Ramirez insisted on that, too. And I take something for my blood pressure, lisinopril, I think it's called. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. But that's only as needed, not regularly. That's about it, I believe. Just the usual assortment for an old man. Do you need to know the dosages? I haven’t memorized them, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Farson. Knowing about the statin, lisinopril, and occasional ibuprofen use is important. I'll check the specific dosages in your medical record. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like bleeding disorders, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My father had heart problems, yes. He died of a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my mother had… arthritis, I suppose. Nothing too serious. My sister, she has diabetes, but other than that… not much that I recall. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, to be honest. A lot of strong-willed people, though. And a lot of… stubbornness. Perhaps that’s a medical condition, come to think of it. Especially on my mother’s side.
DOCTOR: That’s a good observation, Mr. Farson. I’ll make a note of the heart disease history. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle – do you smoke, do you drink alcohol, and what is your general diet like?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t smoke. Never have. Disgusting habit, if you ask me. I do enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner most evenings. Perhaps two, on occasion. And my diet… I try to eat reasonably well. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I avoid processed foods as much as possible. But I do have a sweet tooth, I confess. I can’t resist a good pastry. And I enjoy a good steak now and then. But nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a complete glutton. I keep myself in fairly good shape, considering my age. Though, as I said, the exercise has been… less frequent lately. It's hard to motivate oneself, isn't it? Especially when one is… getting on in years.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Farson. Thank you for being so open and forthcoming. Okay, Mr. Farson. Based on what you’ve told me – the recent dosage increase of warfarin, the increased bruising coinciding with that increase, the fatigue, and your other medications – I think we need to investigate this further. While it’s possible this is just a coincidence, the timing is concerning. First, I’d like to do a physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine the areas where you’ve been bruising. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. I suppose that's what doctors are for, isn’t it? Examining things. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still. Though I warn you, I’m not very good at lying on those examination tables. They’re always so… cold and uncomfortable. And they make me feel like a child again. But do what you have to do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you don’t mind. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We can adjust the table to make you more comfortable, and I’ll be sure to let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/85, but not alarmingly so. Your pulse is regular at 72. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at your bruising. Could you please point to the areas where you’ve noticed it most recently?
PATIENT: Right here, on my forearm. It started as just a little discoloration after bumping it on the coffee table, but it spread quite quickly. And here, on my shin. I honestly can’t recall how I got that one. Just… appeared. And… well, there's a bit on my thigh, here. That one’s smaller, but it’s also been spreading. It's… quite frustrating, to be honest. I feel like I’m walking around covered in a roadmap of old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson. I see the bruising. They appear to be mostly ecchymoses – essentially, areas of blood leaking from the small blood vessels under the skin. They vary in size, and they do seem to be somewhat widespread. There’s no palpable swelling or tenderness, which is good. Your skin feels warm and dry, and there are no other apparent abnormalities. There’s no swelling in your legs or feet, which is also reassuring. Based on the physical exam, there’s nothing immediately alarming, but the widespread bruising and your symptoms warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio to assess your blood clotting factors and see how well your warfarin is working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Blood tests, you say? I’m not particularly fond of needles, but if it’s necessary… go ahead. Will they take a lot of blood? And will it hurt? I always bruise easily, you know, even from the blood tests themselves. It's a vicious cycle, isn't it? But yes, do what you have to do. Just try to be quick about it, if you wouldn’t mind. And perhaps have a bandage handy? I’m a bit squeamish, you see. It's a… gentlemanly affliction.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. It’s good to be cautious, and I’ll do my best to make the process as quick and painless as possible. We’ll only need a small amount of blood for the tests, and I’ll use a fine-gauge needle to minimize discomfort. I’ll also have a bandage ready to apply pressure afterward. And I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, the orders are in. The lab technician will be in to draw your blood shortly. They’ll explain the process to you and answer any questions you may have. While we’re waiting for the results, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just… try to get this sorted out quickly, if you can. I have a dinner reservation tonight, you see. And I wouldn’t want to miss it. My friends would never let me hear the end of it. But yes, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to this matter. It’s reassuring to know someone is taking it seriously. And… try not to poke me too much with that needle, alright? A gentleman can only take so much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I’ll do my best to be quick and gentle. I understand about your dinner reservation, and we’ll get these results back as soon as possible. We’ll proceed as efficiently as we can. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe bleeding – such as nosebleeds that won’t stop, blood in your urine or stool, or any unusually heavy bruising – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It's always better to err on the side of caution. Otherwise, I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. Do you have any questions for me before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I’ll try to relax and not worry too much. Though, to be honest, worrying is something of a hobby of mine. It keeps me young, you see. Well, relatively young. .
