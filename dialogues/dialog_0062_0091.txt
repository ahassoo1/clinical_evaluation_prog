DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor DeCosta. It nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feelin' really thirsty all the time. And hungry! Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat more. It not normal for me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Feeling excessively thirsty and hungry, even after eating, is definitely something we want to look into. How long have you been experiencing this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It start... maybe about a month now? A month or so. It not come on sudden, it just... slowly get worse. At first, I just drink a little more water, but now... now I does be drinkin' all day long. And the hunger... same thing. Little by little, I feel I need more food to feel full.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over about a month. That's helpful. And has anything else changed alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Well... now that you ask... I does be goin' to the bathroom more often. To pee, you know? Especially at night. I have to get up sometimes two, three times to go. That botherin' me a bit, 'cause I not sleepin' as good. Other than that... nothin' I can really think of. I does feel a little tired too, but I always work hard, so maybe that's just from that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased thirst, increased hunger, frequent urination – particularly at night – and some fatigue. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been diagnosed with anything. I does try to stay healthy, you know? I does work out at the pump all day, that's good exercise. My husband, he does take me to the doctor for check-ups when I need them, but they never tell me nothin' bad. Just tell me to keep doin' what I doin'. Blood pressure... I don't think so, never heard of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know you generally stay healthy. And you haven't been told about any high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I remember. Sometimes I forget things, you know? But I sure haven't been told I have anything wrong with my pressure. My husband does the worryin' for both of us, he always tell me if somethin' is wrong. He a good man.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. Not once. And I never been in the hospital, thank goodness. I does try to take care of myself, you know? I don't like doctors or hospitals if I can help it. Just a little aches and pains sometimes from the work, but nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My mother... she had some problems with her feet, she couldn't walk good near the end. And my father... he died young, from a heart attack, I think. But other than that... not really. My sister, she healthy as a horse. And my husband side... I don't know his family too well, they live far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some foot problems with your mother and a heart attack with your father. That's good information. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take nothin'. Never been one for pills. I does drink a lot of water, though. And sometimes I take a little bush tea, from the garden. But that's it. Nothin' the doctor give me, nothin' at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, insect stings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have no allergies. I does eat all kinds of food. My husband, he does make some spicy dishes, and I eat them all! Never had a reaction to anythin', not even when I was a little girl. I does get bitten by mosquitoes sometimes, but that's just part of livin' here, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink alcohol neither. It not good for you, you know? My husband, he used to have a little rum on weekends, but he stopped a long time ago. And I definitely don't use any of those... recreational drugs. I a hard-workin' woman, I don't need nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's alright with me. I does trust you. I just hope it don't take too long, 'cause I have to get back to work later. But I understand you have to do what you have to do. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 145/90. That's a little elevated. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs. It could be nothing, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are intact. I also notice some swelling in your feet and ankles. Do you typically have swelling in your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I does notice the swelling sometimes. Especially in the evenings, after a long day at the pump. I thought it was just from standin' all day. It usually goes down a little when I put my feet up. But it does bother me sometimes, makes my shoes feel tight. I didn't think it was somethin' serious though. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you noticed that it tends to happen after standing for long periods. Swelling in the feet, especially with elevated blood pressure and the crackling in your lungs, does raise some concerns. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including high blood pressure and possible early signs of fluid retention, which could be related to kidney or heart function. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood and urine tests. These tests will help us check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and electrolyte balance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's alright with me. If that's what you think is best. I just want to know what's goin' on and get back to feelin' normal again. I don't like feelin' tired all the time. So, yes, please do the tests. How long it take to get the results? And where I have to go to do them?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will draw the blood and collect a urine sample. It should take about 15-20 minutes. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you reduce your salt intake and drink plenty of water. Avoid processed foods and try to eat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Reduce the salt, drink more water... I can do that. I does love my cookin', but I can try to make healthier choices. I'll go do the tests right away then. And I'll wait for you to call me when the results come back. Thank you for takin' the time to listen to me, Doctor. I feel a little better just knowin' what's goin' on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will give you instructions on how to access your results online as well. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
