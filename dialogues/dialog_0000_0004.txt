DOCTOR: Right. Teah Fornes, yes?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Good to meet you, Dr. Batara, I think? It's nice to finally get in here. Been meaning to do this for a while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. Well, don't make a habit of meaning to. It usually ends poorly. Now, let's get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Just a routine check-up, really. And some shots, I think? My husband, Frank, said it was time for some boosters and things. He's always good about keeping track of all that. I honestly can't remember which ones, though. He handles all the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Boosters… right. Frank. Always helpful to have someone else manage things, isn’t it?
PATIENT: You have no idea. He's a retired carpenter, always organized. I’m more… free-spirited, I guess you could say. I build things too, but I don't worry so much about lists and dates. More about how it feels when it’s done, you know?
DOCTOR: "How it feels." Well, that’s all very… artistic. Unfortunately, medicine requires a bit more precision than feelings. Let's start with a basic history. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel pretty good, all things considered. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but honestly, that could just be the weather. It's been awfully hot this summer. And you know, getting older. It does things to you! Nothing I’m worried about, though. No aches, no pains, no weird stuff. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: "Normal." Hmm. According to your file – and I use that term loosely, it’s rather sparse – you haven’t been in for a check-up in… seven years. Seven years is hardly "normal." Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Seven years, is it? Frank will hear about that! I probably should have been better about it. Let's see… pre-existing… well, I had a bad knee a few years back, from falling off a roof. Fixed it with surgery, though. That was maybe ten years ago? And I've always had a bit of trouble with my back, from lifting heavy stuff on the job, but nothing a little stretching doesn’t help. Honestly, that’s about it. I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. Mostly just try to stay active.
DOCTOR: "Mostly." Right. A knee surgery ten years ago and occasional back discomfort. And you “try” to stay active. Let’s get some specifics. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I prefer natural remedies when I can. Stretching, good food, lots of water… that sort of thing. Frank tries to get me to take something for my cholesterol, but I always say no. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: No medications… cholesterol concerns… I see. Any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things my whole life, and I haven't had any reactions. I grew up eating a lot of traditional foods, too—salmon, berries, that sort of thing—and never had any trouble with those. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something by now, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: One would think. However, allergies can develop at any time. Now, let's move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mom had some heart trouble when she got older, I think. And my grandpa, on my dad’s side, had diabetes. But honestly, a lot of my family history is… well, it’s not really written down, you know? We come from a long line of people who lived off the land, and they didn’t really keep records of things like that. Mostly just passed down stories. So I can’t really say for sure what runs in the family. It's just… general old-age stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: “General old-age stuff.” Wonderful. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like… what do I do for fun? Well, I build things, mostly. Houses, sheds, furniture... I’m a carpenter, like my husband. I also like to go fishing with Frank when I can, and spend time with our grandkids. We live pretty simple lives. Is that what you mean? Or is there something else you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Simple lives.” Right. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, if Frank's got a nice bottle, but that's about it. And drugs? Never even been tempted. I don't need any of that. I get my relaxation from building things, from being outdoors. That's enough for me. Is that what you were getting at?
DOCTOR: Right. So, no harmful habits. Good. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Hope I haven't gained too much weight since the last time. Frank's been making a lot of good food lately...
DOCTOR: One hundred and fourteen pounds. Height five feet seven inches. Okay. Blood pressure is 128 over 78. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, neurological function is intact. Everything seems within normal limits. However, given your lack of recent medical history, and the vague nature of your self-reported health, I'd like to order some basic bloodwork. Cholesterol, glucose, complete blood count… just to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, I suppose. A baseline is a good idea, if I haven't been in for a check-up in so long. Frank will be happy to hear I'm finally taking this seriously. Just… please don’t find anything too awful, okay? I’m trying to enjoy my retirement.
DOCTOR: I make no promises. We'll see what the results say. Here’s the order for the bloodwork. You can get that done at the lab across the street. Fasting for twelve hours beforehand. And please schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Twelve hours fasting… that might be a little tough, but I can manage. Thank you, Dr. Batara. I appreciate you taking the time to… well, to poke and prod, and listen to my heart. And for not finding anything too awful, hopefully! I’ll go get the bloodwork done, and schedule that follow-up. I guess that’s all. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: See that it is. And try to remember things for once. .
