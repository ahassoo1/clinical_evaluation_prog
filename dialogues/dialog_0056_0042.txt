DOCTOR: Hi Londell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I saw your ad about… well, just kinda gettin' things tuned up, you know? Men's health optimization, that’s what it said. I’m 69, and while I feel pretty good for my age, I figure it can't hurt to make sure things stay that way. Mostly just want to check in and see what I can do to keep on keepin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's smart. “Men's health optimization” is a good way to put it. We can definitely do a check-up and talk about ways to maintain your health. Just to get started, can you tell me a little bit more about what “feeling pretty good” means to you?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Well, I don’t have any major aches or pains, thankfully. I still get around pretty well – I’m an etcher, so I’m on my feet and using my hands a good bit, and that keeps me movin’. Energy levels are okay, not like when I was a young man, naturally. Sleep is…well, sleep comes and goes, like it does at this age, I reckon. I eat pretty good, mostly. And I haven’t been sick with anything serious in a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Londell. That's all really helpful. So, no major pain, good activity level with your etching, sleep is a little spotty, and generally good health. Okay. Let’s dig a little deeper. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – like frequency, urgency, or any difficulty starting or stopping?
PATIENT: Hmm...now that you mention it, I do get up a couple of times a night to pee. More than I used to, that’s for sure. And sometimes it takes a moment to get things goin', you know? Not terrible, just…not as strong a stream as it used to be, I suppose. Never had any burning or anything like that, though. Just a little slower and a little more frequent. Is that somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Getting up a couple of times a night and a slightly weaker stream…those can be signs of a few different things, and it's good we're talking about it. We'll definitely want to check a few things. Now, just to get a full picture, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a personal question, ain’t it? Let’s see…things are pretty regular, I’d say. Not perfect, mind you – an old man’s gotta have some complaints, right? – but no major changes. Not constipated or anything like that. And no… well, no trouble holdin' things in, if you know what I mean. Just normal for an older fella, I suppose. Does that answer your question? I'm a pretty open book, just wasn't expectin' to talk about this first thing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your openness, Londell, and I apologize if I jumped straight to personal questions. It's all part of getting a complete health picture. "Normal for an older fella" is good to hear. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Not much change in appetite, really. I still enjoy a good meal. Maybe I don’t eat as much as I used to, but that’s probably just age, you know? Weight… I reckon I've lost a few pounds over the last year or so, but not intentionally. Didn't really notice it til my daughter commented on it at Christmas. Probably just gettin' smaller in my old age. I’m around 172, give or take. Used to be closer to 180. Is that somethin’ I should be concerned about? I don't feel weak or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight weight loss of around 8 pounds over the last year, unintentional, but you don't feel weak. That's helpful. And just to cover all bases, have you experienced any fever, chills, or unexplained fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Nope. No fever, no chills, and I wouldn’t say I’m fatigued. I get tired at the end of the day, naturally, but that’s just bein’ 69. I haven’t had a proper sick day in… well, I can’t rightly remember when. I feel pretty sturdy, honestly. More aches and pains from bein’ an etcher than from any illness. I'm pretty lucky, I reckon. Do you want me to keep goin’ through a checklist, or is this enough for now?
DOCTOR: That's really good to hear, and honestly, you sound very healthy for your age. This is a great start. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things and make sure everything aligns with what you're telling me. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me. An old man doesn’t mind a poke and prod if it keeps him goin’. What all does that involve? I ain’t afraid, just like to know what I’m gettin' into.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, check your reflexes, and do a brief abdominal exam. I’ll also want to do a prostate exam – that's a standard part of a men's health checkup, especially given your age and the slight changes in your urination. It involves a quick digital rectal exam to check the size and texture of your prostate. It’s not the most comfortable thing in the world, but it's quick and important. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Well now… that prostate exam… I’ve heard tell of that one. Ain’t nobody likes that, I reckon. But if it's important, I suppose I can grit my teeth and get it over with. Just… let me know when you're about to do it, alright? Don’t want to be caught off guard. And try to be gentle, if you can. An old man's parts are a little…sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Londell. I completely understand. I'll explain everything beforehand, and we'll take it slow. I'll warn you before each step and let you know what I'm doing. Your comfort is my priority. Let’s start with your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs, then we'll take a quick break before moving on to the prostate exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. Best to get the less…intimate parts over with last. Blood pressure and listenin' sounds good. Let's get it done. Just tell me when to breathe, alright? I tend to hold my breath when I get nervous.
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just relax, and I'll let you know when to take a deep breath. First, I’m going to put this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze a little, but only for a moment. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this point. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good there. Now, before we move on, do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, you say? Is that somethin' I need to worry about right away? I don’t take no medication, and I don’t salt my food much. Mostly just try to eat sensible. Otherwise, sounds good that everything else is clear. No wheezin' is a good sign. I used to know a fella with terrible lung problems… nasty business. But no, I don’t have any questions right now. Just…still dreadin' that other part. Let’s get it over with, I suppose. No use puttin' it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, slightly elevated blood pressure isn’t an immediate cause for alarm, but it's something we'll keep an eye on. We can talk about some lifestyle adjustments later if needed. Alright, let's move on to the prostate exam. I'll need you to lean forward on the exam table, please. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you're feeling any discomfort. I’ll use lubricant and go slow. Just relax as much as possible. This will only take a few moments. I'm going to put on a glove and use some lubricant now. Just take some deep breaths, and let me know how you're doing. Okay, here we go…
PATIENT: Alright… here goes nothin'. Just… gentle now, Doctor. And warn me before you poke around too much. It's… not my favorite part, to say the least. Deep breaths, deep breaths. This is for my health, gotta think about my health. Just let me know when it's over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger gently now. This might feel a little uncomfortable, but it should be brief. Just try to relax your muscles. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it's smooth and symmetrical. No hard lumps or areas of tenderness. That's good. Alright, we’re all done. Just take a moment to breathe and get comfortable. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Well… that wasn’t as bad as I imagined, but I ain't volunteerin' to do that again anytime soon. Slightly enlarged, you say? Is that somethin' to worry about? Everything else sounded good – smooth and symmetrical, that’s a good sign, right? How enlarged are we talkin’? Is it somethin' that’ll cause trouble down the road? I’m just tryin’ to figure out if I need to start thinkin’ about special trips to the doctor on a regular basis.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear it wasn’t too bad. Slightly enlarged is common with age, Londell. We’ll call it mild enlargement. Smooth and symmetrical is a very good sign. It means there aren’t any immediate concerns about prostate cancer. However, mild enlargement can sometimes cause urinary symptoms like difficulty starting or stopping, frequent urination, or a weak stream – which you've already mentioned. We can monitor it with an annual exam, and if your symptoms worsen, we can discuss further options like medication or lifestyle adjustments. To get a more complete picture, I’d also like to order a PSA blood test. It’s a simple blood test that helps us assess your prostate health and detect any changes over time. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A PSA test, you say? Sounds sensible. If it helps keep track of things, I'm all for it. Monitor it annually, that sounds fair. I don't want any surprises down the road. Lifestyle adjustments... what kinda adjustments are we talkin’ about? Less coffee? More walkin’? I'm willin’ to make some changes if it keeps me goin’. And just to be clear, this mild enlargement… it ain’t gonna suddenly turn into somethin’ terrible overnight, is it? I worry sometimes, bein’ an old man, you know? Gotta think about the future.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s good you're thinking about the future. It's unlikely to suddenly turn terrible overnight, but regular monitoring allows us to catch any changes early. Lifestyle adjustments can include things like limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, staying hydrated, and practicing pelvic floor exercises – sometimes called Kegel exercises – to strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and prostate. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are also beneficial. I can give you some information on those exercises. And we'll discuss the PSA test results when they come back. It's just an extra layer of information to help us make informed decisions about your health. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… those sound… interesting. I’ll be honest, I ain’t ever heard of those before. Information on those would be good. And no, I reckon that’s all my questions for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly, and not makin’ me feel like a fool askin’ all these questions. I feel a little better knowin’ what’s goin’ on, even if it’s just a slightly enlarged prostate. So, what’s the next step? Do I just schedule another appointment for a year from now, and get the blood test done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. I'm glad I could help. And no, you didn't feel like a fool at all. It's important to ask questions, and I’m happy to answer them. Yes, the next step is to schedule a follow-up appointment for one year from now, and we'll get the PSA blood test done. I'll have the nurse draw the blood before you leave today. I'll also print out some information on pelvic floor exercises for you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Nope. I think that about covers it. Blood test and the exercise info, that’s perfect. You’ve been a big help, Doctor Amussen. Thank you again. I appreciate your time and your patience. And tell that nurse to be gentle with the needle, alright? I ain't the best with 'em.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. I'll be sure to let the nurse know about the needle. I’m glad I could help. Here's the information on pelvic floor exercises. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good rest of your day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: .
