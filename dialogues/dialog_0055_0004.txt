DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fornes. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you are 53 years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Eaddy. Good to meet you. Just here for my regular shots, you know? Keepin’ up to date. Routine immunization visit, the paper said. I try to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that noted here. A “routine immunization visit.” However, I don’t quite recall… what specific immunizations were you hoping to receive today, Ms. Fornes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. To be honest, I don't really keep track of which ones. I just know it's time for some boosters, I think? Whatever they recommend for someone my age, really. I just leave it up to the professionals. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe something that says what I should have?
DOCTOR: Well, “whatever they recommend” isn’t particularly helpful for accurate medical care, Ms. Fornes. It's important to know your vaccination history. Let me see what’s documented in your chart… Hmm. It appears there’s very little recorded regarding your previous immunizations. This makes it difficult to determine precisely what you require. Do you happen to recall ever receiving a tetanus booster?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I knew I should have kept better track of things. My mama always told me to keep those little cards, but…well, life happens, right? Let me think… tetanus… I think so. A long time ago. Maybe when I was younger? Working construction, I probably needed one then. But honestly, it was so long ago, I can’t be certain. It’s been… decades, I guess. And I haven’t really thought about it since. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: It’s… marginally helpful, Ms. Fornes. But “maybe” and “decades ago” are insufficient for proper medical assessment. Given the lack of documentation, and your uncertainty, we will need to proceed with a series of boosters to ensure adequate protection. This will include tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – a Tdap booster – as well as influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. Now, do you have any allergies to vaccines, or have you experienced any adverse reactions to them in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that sounds… thorough! That’s good, I guess. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, vaccines included. Never had a bad reaction before, thankfully. Nothing springs to mind, anyway. I get a little sore sometimes, like after a flu shot, but nothing major. Just a bit achy, you know? It usually goes away pretty quick. Is that normal? I worry a little about side effects, but I know it's important to be protected.
DOCTOR: “A little sore” is a rather vague description, Ms. Fornes. However, mild localized pain and tenderness at the injection site are common and expected reactions. I would be more concerned with a high fever, difficulty breathing, or significant swelling – those would warrant immediate attention. But those are rare. Now, before proceeding, I must inquire about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with anything chronic, thankfully. I’ve been pretty lucky health-wise, knock on wood. I do have a little arthritis in my hands, just from years of working with tools, but it’s not…serious. Just a bit stiff in the mornings, mostly. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. And I try to stay active, you know? Helps with the stiffness. Is that something I need to worry about with the shots?
DOCTOR: Mild arthritis is unlikely to contraindicate vaccinations, Ms. Fornes. However, it is still important to document all medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, working on a roof. Nothing major, really. No big surgeries, no long hospital stays. Just the wrist and the tonsils. That was… oh, goodness, probably 50 years ago now. Does that help? I'm trying to remember everything... it's been a long life.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… sufficient for now, Ms. Fornes. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, not really. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my hands, when they’re really achy. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I’m not very good about remembering to take it regularly. That’s about it. No prescriptions, no special herbal remedies. Just the basics. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, you know? Natural is best, if you can manage it.
DOCTOR: A preference for “natural” remedies is… noted, Ms. Fornes. However, it's important to disclose all substances you ingest. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. No allergies to foods, no reactions to any medicines. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. And no environmental allergies, like pollen or dust. I can breathe easy, thankfully. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. Just… nothing. That's a relief, isn’t it? Hopefully, I won’t suddenly discover one now.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your… limited medical history, and the absence of any reported allergies, we may proceed with the vaccinations. I will administer the Tdap, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines today. Please be aware that you may experience some mild soreness, fatigue, or a low-grade fever following administration. If symptoms persist or worsen, contact the clinic. Now, please lower your sleeve…
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Just let me know if there's anything I should do after. And thank you, Dr. Eaddy. I appreciate you takin’ the time to make sure I’m protected. Here you go. And… is it okay if I sit here for a bit after? Just to make sure I don’t feel dizzy or anything?
DOCTOR: That concludes the vaccinations, Ms. Fornes. Yes, you may remain seated for approximately 15 minutes for observation. I will return shortly to assess your condition.
