DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Giganti, you say? A… a fine name. Well, it’s… it's a rather personal matter, truthfully. Something I haven't… discussed with anyone before, not really. It’s… a discharge. Yes, a discharge. From… down there. It's been… present for a bit now, I suppose. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I wouldn't even know how long exactly. It's… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It takes courage to discuss personal matters, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. A discharge, you said. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. Well, it’s not… clear, certainly. Not like water. More… viscous, I believe is the word my wife, Eleanor, used once. A bit… yellowish, perhaps? Though the lighting in the bathroom isn’t the best, you understand. And it… smells. Not a pleasant odor, no. It's… concerning. Though, to be perfectly honest, Doctor, at my age, one expects these things, doesn’t one? A body… deteriorating. It's the natural order. But Eleanor insisted I come in. She worries, you see. A good woman, Eleanor. Though a bit… insistent.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good that Eleanor is looking out for you. And it's always best to investigate changes, regardless of age. So, yellowish discharge, not clear, and with an odor. Has the amount of discharge changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Changed… yes, I believe it has. At first, it was… barely noticeable, just a spot, really. I thought perhaps it was a bit of soap residue, or… something. But then it became… more substantial. Not a flood, mind you, but enough to… require attention. And the odor has become… stronger. Though, truthfully, Doctor, my sense of smell isn't what it used to be either. Eleanor says it's… quite noticeable. She has a very sensitive nose, my Eleanor. Always could smell a burnt toast a mile away. It's… bothersome, yes. And I’ve felt a bit of… discomfort. A slight burning sensation, particularly… during urination. Though it’s not excruciating, mind you. Just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting minimal, now more substantial with a stronger odor, and some burning with urination. That's helpful information, thank you. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no fever, certainly. No chills. No pain in my… lower back, thankfully. My back's been acting up enough lately with the gardening. And no… no swelling, that I’ve noticed. Though, I haven’t… examined myself particularly closely, you understand. At my age, one doesn’t tend to do those sorts of things anymore. Eleanor would be the one to… notice such things, if there were any. No… I can’t think of anything else at the moment. Though… I have been feeling a bit… tired lately. But then again, who isn’t tired at my age? Perhaps it's simply the summer heat. It's been quite oppressive, hasn't it? Still, Eleanor insists something is… amiss. She always does. A very perceptive woman, my wife. Very perceptive indeed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, back pain, or swelling. Just the fatigue which could be related to the heat. And you mentioned the discharge, the burning with urination, and that it's been increasing. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I had the… the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. I served in the military, you know, back in… oh, goodness, it must be sixty years ago now. Had all the vaccinations they required, of course. And I had my prostate checked… periodically, for years. A bit unpleasant, to be frank, but necessary, I suppose. The doctor always said it was… enlarged, but not overly concerning. I have… high blood pressure, I believe. Eleanor manages my medication for that. And… arthritis, of course. In my hands, mostly. Makes gardening a bit difficult. Beyond that… nothing much. I’ve never been a fan of doctors, to be perfectly honest. Avoided them whenever possible. Eleanor, of course, thinks differently. She insists on regular checkups. A very… thorough woman, my wife. Very thorough indeed. But as for serious illnesses… no, I’ve been fortunate, all things considered. Though, at my age, one never knows what might be lurking around the corner, does one?
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, military service with vaccinations, prostate checked periodically with enlargement noted, high blood pressure managed by Eleanor, and arthritis in your hands. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. A rather unpleasant affair, it was. A hernia, years ago. Must have been… thirty, forty years ago now. Required a stay in the hospital. Not a comfortable experience, I assure you. And… oh, yes. I had my appendix out when I was quite young. A sudden illness, I remember. But that was so long ago, it scarcely seems real now. Beyond that… no, I don’t believe so. Certainly nothing recent. I’ve always been rather careful, you see. Avoided strenuous activity whenever possible. And I’ve always been a bit… cautious, you might say. Eleanor, of course, has a different perspective on things. She encourages me to stay active. A very… energetic woman, my wife. Very energetic indeed. But as for surgeries… just the hernia and the appendix, as far as I can recall. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps I’m forgetting something. It wouldn’t surprise me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hernia repair and appendectomy in the past. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's a difficult question. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, from… heart problems, I believe. Though I wasn't very close to him, to be honest. And my mother… she lived to a very old age, but she suffered from… arthritis, rather badly. And she had… diabetes, I believe. Towards the end. Beyond that… I don't really know. My siblings… they all moved away years ago. We lost touch, to be perfectly honest. We weren't a particularly close family, you see. Everyone went their own way. And I don’t recall anyone mentioning any… hereditary conditions. Though that doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. My family wasn’t one for… discussing such things, you see. It was considered rather… indelicate, I believe. Eleanor, of course, has a more… open approach to things. She keeps track of all our family history, meticulously. A very… organized woman, my wife. Very organized indeed. But as for medical conditions… heart problems and arthritis, as far as I can recall. Though it's possible I’m forgetting something. My memory, as you know, isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart problems and arthritis in the family. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, Eleanor, wouldn't allow it, you see. She always said it was… dreadful for one's health. And I tend to agree with her. It’s a filthy habit, in my opinion. And I've always been rather… sensitive to strong odors. The smell of cigarette smoke is… quite unpleasant. Besides, my father smoked, you see. And he… well, he didn’t live a very long life. So, no, I've never smoked. Not even a puff. Eleanor would have my hide if I did. A very… determined woman, my wife. Very determined indeed. She's very particular about my health, you see. So, no, definitely not a smoker. Never have been, never will be. It's simply not done.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. Well, I wouldn’t say I abstain entirely. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner… occasionally. Usually a red wine, with the lamb. Eleanor and I, we enjoy a good meal together. It's a… a civilized habit, you might say. But I certainly don’t… indulge excessively. A glass of wine with dinner, and that's it. Nothing more. I’ve never been one for… strong spirits, you see. Whiskey and vodka… far too harsh for my palate. And Eleanor… well, she keeps a close eye on my consumption. She wouldn’t allow me to… overindulge. She's very… practical, you see. Keeps everything in moderation. So, yes, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. But nothing more. It's a… a reasonable habit, I believe. Not excessive at all. Eleanor would certainly agree. A very… sensible woman, my wife. Very sensible indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Yes, I am. Eleanor manages most of it, you see. For my blood pressure, as I mentioned before. A small pill, every morning. And… oh, yes. For my arthritis. Something to help with the pain. It’s a… a yellow capsule, I believe. And… sometimes, when my back is acting up, Eleanor gives me something for that. A muscle relaxant, I think it is. But that's only… as needed. I wouldn’t be able to tell you the names of them, to be honest. Eleanor keeps track of all that. She’s very… meticulous, you see. She has a chart in the kitchen, listing all my medications and dosages. I simply take what she gives me. I trust her implicitly. She’s very… knowledgeable, you see. About all things medical. So, yes, I take medications for my blood pressure and arthritis. And sometimes for my back. But Eleanor manages it all. I simply follow her instructions. She's a very… capable woman, my wife. Very capable indeed. She keeps me going, to be honest. Without her, I’d be lost.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination… hmm. Well, I suppose it's necessary, isn't it? I’m not particularly fond of examinations, to be frank. But I understand it’s part of the process. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I trust your… discretion. Just… please be gentle, if you would. And try to be… quick. I haven’t… a great deal of patience, you see. And I’m rather sensitive, if you would. Eleanor says I'm a bit of a… baby, when it comes to medical procedures. But she’s probably right. So, yes, proceed with the examination. But please be gentle, if you would. And quick. And discreet. Eleanor wouldn’t want me… making a fuss. A very… pragmatic woman, my wife. Very pragmatic indeed. She expects me to… cooperate. So, yes, proceed. But gently, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Let’s begin. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’d like to take a look at your abdomen. Please lie back, and relax. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant masses or guarding. Now, I’d like to do a brief genital exam, to examine the source of the discharge. This is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A genital exam… hmm. Yes, well, I suppose it’s… unavoidable, isn’t it? I’m not particularly thrilled at the prospect, to be frank. But I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be quick, Doctor. And… discreet. And… gentle. As you said before. I’m… a bit sensitive, you see. And I'd… prefer not to linger over it, if you would. Eleanor says I’m a bit of a… worrier. But she’s probably right. Just get it over with, if you would. Quickly, gently, and discreetly. And explain everything as you go, as you promised. I trust your… professionalism, Doctor. And I trust your… judgment. Just… please be quick. That’s all I ask. Quickly, gently, and discreetly. Eleanor wouldn’t want me… making a fuss. A very… stoic woman, my wife. Very stoic indeed. She expects me to… cooperate. So, yes, proceed. But quickly, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your apprehension. I will be as quick, gentle, and discreet as possible. I’m just checking for any signs of inflammation, lesions, or abnormalities. I notice some mild redness around the urethral opening, and a small amount of purulent discharge. There's no obvious pain with palpation of the prostate through digital rectal exam, but it does feel slightly enlarged. Alright. Based on my examination, the redness and discharge suggest a possible infection, such as urethritis or prostatitis. The enlarged prostate is consistent with your previous medical history. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order a urine test to check for bacteria and white blood cells. We can also do a prostate-specific antigen test to further evaluate the prostate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine test… PSA test… hmm. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I suppose it's alright. I trust your… medical expertise. Though I must confess, I don't understand all these… technical terms. Urethritis… prostatitis… PSA… it's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Eleanor would know what all that means, I'm sure. She’s very… knowledgeable about these things. She reads all the medical articles, you see. A very… informed woman, my wife. Very informed indeed. She keeps track of everything. So, yes, proceed with the tests. But please explain the results to me in… simple terms, if you would. I don't understand all the… jargon. And please… don't linger over the details. Just tell me what it means. Is it serious? Is it curable? Those are the only questions I care about. Eleanor wouldn’t want me… worrying needlessly. A very… practical woman, my wife. Very practical indeed. She expects me to… face the facts. So, yes, proceed with the tests. But please explain the results… simply. And don't linger over the details. Just tell me what it means. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will explain the results in simple terms and avoid medical jargon. Let me assure you, many of these conditions are treatable. The urine test will help us identify if there's a bacterial infection causing the urethritis. If an infection is present, antibiotics are usually very effective. The PSA test is a blood test that measures a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can indicate an enlarged prostate or, in some cases, prostate cancer. However, elevated PSA levels don't always mean cancer, and further investigation may be needed if the results are concerning. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let’s start with the urine test. I’ll give you a container, and you can collect a sample in the restroom. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Well, one question, if you don't mind. Will these tests… be painful? I’m rather sensitive, as you know. And I don't particularly enjoy medical procedures. Eleanor says I’m a bit of a… coward, when it comes to these things. But she’s probably right. Just tell me… will they be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting. Eleanor says I’m a bit of a… fidget, when I’m anxious. But she’s probably right. So, yes, will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? That’s all I want to know. Eleanor wouldn’t want me… worrying needlessly. A very… calming woman, my wife. Very calming indeed. She keeps me grounded. So, yes, will they be painful? And how long for the results? Please. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: The urine test is completely painless. It simply involves collecting a sample in a cup. The PSA test involves a small blood draw, which may cause a brief pinch, but it's usually very quick and well-tolerated. As for the results, the urine test usually takes 24-48 hours, and the PSA test can take up to a week. We’ll contact you as soon as we have the results, and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Fever, chills, worsening pain… hmm. Yes, I’ll remember that. Eleanor always says I’m a bit of a… worrier, when it comes to these things. But she’s probably right. Well, I suppose that’s all I need to know, for now. 24-48 hours for the urine test, up to a week for the blood draw. And contact you as soon as you have the results. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very patient with me. I appreciate it. Eleanor would be… pleased. She always says I’m a bit of a… handful, when it comes to medical appointments. But she’s probably right. So, yes, thank you. I think that’s all for now. Just… try to be quick, if you would. Eleanor wouldn’t want me… lingering over this needlessly. A very… efficient woman, my wife. Very efficient indeed. She keeps everything moving. So, yes, thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krok. I'm happy to help. Please take your time collecting the sample, and let me know if you have any questions. I'll be right outside if you need anything. And don’t worry, we’ll get through this together.
