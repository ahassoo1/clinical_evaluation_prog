DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Burlingham, it’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve just been getting these chills, and it’s kind of annoying, honestly. Not like a fever chill, just…cold. It started a couple of days ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm, chills, you say. Not accompanied by a fever, just the feeling of being cold. And you said a couple of days ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two days. Maybe three? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, you know? Like, I'll be fine, then suddenly I feel really cold for a bit, then warm again. It’s not constant.
DOCTOR: Right, intermittent chills. Okay. And is anything with the chills?
PATIENT: Um…let me think. Not really. No headache or anything. I haven’t been coughing. No sore throat. Just…the cold. And a little tired, maybe? But I mean, who isn’t tired, right?
DOCTOR: That’s true, many people are tired. But we still need to figure out why you’re tired, along with the chills. Have you noticed any muscle aches, any nausea, or any digestive issues at all?
PATIENT: No muscle aches, thankfully. And no, nothing with my stomach. I’ve been eating pretty normally, I think. No nausea or…anything like that. Just the chills and the tiredness, really. It’s just…weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t traveled. Not for a while. And…hmm. My niece had a little cold last week, but it was just a regular cold, you know? A sniffly nose, a bit of a cough. Nothing major. I saw her for a couple of hours, but that was a few days ago now.
DOCTOR: Right. A mild cold in your niece. And you've had no other contact with sick individuals, or any unusual exposures?
PATIENT: No, nothing else comes to mind. Just the usual, everyday stuff. Work, grocery shopping, seeing friends…nothing out of the ordinary. It’s frustrating because I can’t figure out why I’m feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Well, let's see what the records say. You’ve been keeping up with your vaccinations, I see… good. No major medical issues listed here. Alright, let’s do a quick exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and just take a look at your general condition. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up here for me. I’m going to listen to your chest first. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… everything sounds clear so far. Now let's check your temperature. 98.6… normal. Blood pressure is 120 over 80, pulse is 72… also normal. No swelling here. I don’t see anything obviously concerning on a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear, I guess? So…what could it be then? I mean, if everything is normal?
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" doesn't always mean easy to figure out. Sometimes these things are viral… a minor infection that doesn't show up on basic tests. Or… it could be stress. A lot of people present with vague symptoms like chills and fatigue when they're under a lot of pressure. Are you experiencing anything particularly stressful lately?
PATIENT: Stress…hmm. Work has been a bit hectic, to be honest. New manager, lots of changes…and I’m still getting used to being divorced. It’s been a year, but it still pops up sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Divorce is stressful, even after a year. And a new manager…changes at work…those can certainly contribute. Honestly, Jailenne, it sounds like this is likely a stress-related response. A lot of people underestimate the physical toll that emotional stress can take on the body. We could run some blood work to rule out anything else, but it’s probably not necessary at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. I guess I haven’t really been taking care of myself, with everything going on. So…what do I do?
DOCTOR: Well, first, you need to prioritize self-care. That means getting enough sleep, eating properly, and staying hydrated. And find healthy ways to manage your stress. Exercise, meditation, spending time with loved ones... whatever works for you. I recommend you try to implement at least one stress-reducing activity into your daily routine. I'm not going to prescribe you anything at this time. We'll see how you do with lifestyle changes. I'll give you a handout with some resources for stress management. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds…doable. A handout would be great, thank you. I guess I just needed someone to tell me it wasn't something terrible going on.
DOCTOR: There you go. It lists some local support groups as well, if you feel like talking to others going through similar experiences. Now, I want to see you back in a month if you’re still experiencing these symptoms. If they worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms – fever, cough, body aches – call the office immediately. Otherwise, focus on taking care of yourself, and we’ll reassess in a month. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Burlingham. I really appreciate your time and help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Try not to worry too much, Jailenne. And remember, taking care of yourself isn’t selfish, it's necessary. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again. .
