DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Reisig. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart…it hasn’t been the best lately, you see. My own doctor said I should come in about it. It feels…worse when I lie down, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sadhu. A persistent cough and heart concerns – I understand. It's good you came in to get this checked out. Could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? It’s not a bad cough all the time, just…sometimes it feels like there's something stuck in my throat. And like I said, lying down is the worst. I have to use extra pillows. It’s a dry cough, mostly. No… not much mucus, really. Just… irritating. I try to drink tea, you know, warm tea with honey. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sadhu. A dry cough that’s worse when lying down, starting about a month ago, and some sensation of something stuck in your throat. The warm tea with honey is a good idea – that can be soothing. Now, regarding your heart – could you describe what you mean by “hasn’t been the best”?
PATIENT: Oh, well. It gets…tired. Like it’s working too hard, even when I’m not doing much. And my ankles…they swell up at the end of the day. Not terribly, but enough that I can’t wear my good shoes sometimes. My own doctor, Dr. Alvarez, he said it was…congestive heart failure, I think he called it? Years ago, now. We’ve been managing it with…pills. I take a few different ones every day. Do you need to know what they are? I have a list in my purse, somewhere…
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you could find that list, that would be very helpful. Knowing your current medications is important. And it's good Dr. Alvarez has been managing this previously. So, to clarify, you’ve experienced ankle swelling and fatigue, and were previously diagnosed with congestive heart failure. Is the fatigue new, or has it been ongoing?
PATIENT: It’s gotten worse lately, I think. I used to be able to do a little gardening, you know? A few tomato plants, some flowers. But now, even walking to the mailbox is…a lot. It feels like I run out of steam very quickly. The swelling has always been there a little bit, but it’s definitely worse when it’s hot, or if I’ve been on my feet for too long. It just…feels like everything is working harder than it should. Oh! And sometimes I feel a little short of breath, even when I’m just sitting. It’s not terrible, but it bothers me. Here’s the list…I hope it’s legible.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. Let me take a look. Okay, I see here you’re taking Lisinopril, Furosemide, Digoxin, and a potassium supplement. That's a standard regimen for heart failure. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I get so tired of coughing and feeling…weak. Listen to my heart, check my ankles…go right ahead. Just…be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sadhu. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I'll need you to take a few deep breaths for me, if you can. …I’m hearing some crackles in your lungs, especially in the lower lobes. Your heart sounds… a bit irregular, and I can hear a murmur. It's not alarming at this point, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Now, let's take a look at your ankles. Could you please extend your legs for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. I can do that. And yes, here they are… They’re not terrible today, but they’re definitely there. My daughter keeps telling me I should elevate them more, but it’s hard to sit still for long. It's just… uncomfortable. I think they're a little bit bigger than usual, actually. Now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. I see the swelling, and it does appear to be a bit more pronounced than it might be normally. And you're right to mention that it's a bit more than usual. Given your history of heart failure, the new onset of increased ankle swelling, shortness of breath, and the crackles I’m hearing in your lungs, I’m concerned that your heart failure may be worsening. We need to get some tests done to confirm this and see how well your heart is functioning. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, an electrocardiogram to check your heart rhythm, and a blood test called a BNP. That BNP test helps us assess the level of stress your heart is under. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…serious. But yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like feeling like this. X-ray, EKG, BNP… whatever they are. Just… tell me what I need to do. Will I have to stay here? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Sadhu. It's my job to figure out what's going on and get you feeling better. The X-ray is quick and painless – you'll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds. The EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's electrical activity. And the blood test is just a simple blood draw. We can do the EKG and blood draw right here in the office. I'll send you to the radiology department for the chest X-ray, and you should be able to go home afterwards. It shouldn't take too long. I'll also want to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter, just to see how well you're breathing. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. That further supports my concern about possible fluid build-up in your lungs. While we wait for the lab results, I'm going to give you some oxygen through a nasal cannula, just to help you breathe easier. And I’m going to order a diuretic – a water pill – to help get rid of some of the excess fluid. Is there any allergy to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems with pills before. Dr. Alvarez always asked, and I always said no. Maybe…maybe I got a little itchy once, a long time ago, with something, but I don’t remember what it was. Nothing serious, though. Water pill… that sounds good, actually. Anything to get rid of some of this… stuffiness. Oxygen… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just please, let me know what’s going on. I don’t like being in the dark.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. That's good to know about the possible itchiness – we'll keep that in mind. I've ordered the oxygen, and I'll have the nurse bring it over shortly. We’ll start you on a low dose of Furosemide, the diuretic. It will help your kidneys remove some of the extra fluid from your body. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I'd like to get a more detailed history of your symptoms. When did you first notice the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… the shortness of breath… let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little winded after walking upstairs. But it’s been getting worse each day, I think. Yesterday, I had to stop and rest halfway through making lunch. And even just talking sometimes feels… difficult. It’s not a wheezing, or anything. Just… like I can’t get enough air. I haven’t been coughing more, though. Just this…tiredness and the shortness of breath and the swelling. And now, this stuffiness you mentioned. It’s all happening so quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sadhu. Shortness of breath worsening over the past week, starting with mild difficulty after exertion and progressing to feeling breathless even with everyday activities. No increased cough. That’s very helpful. The nurse is preparing the oxygen now. I'm also going to have her check your blood pressure and heart rate. Given your symptoms and history, I’m concerned you are experiencing an acute exacerbation of your congestive heart failure, likely due to fluid overload. While the tests will help confirm this, it’s best to start treatment now to alleviate your symptoms. I want to stress that this isn’t necessarily a sign that your heart failure is getting worse permanently – it often happens, and can be managed with adjustments to your medication. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Acute… exacerbation… that sounds frightening. So, it’s not… the end? It can be fixed? Or at least…managed? My daughter always worries so much. She keeps telling me I should move into a retirement home, but I don’t want to leave my garden. And… will I be able to take my regular pills after this? I don’t want to mess up my routine, if I can help it. Is it okay if I have a cup of tea? It might calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re frightened, Ms. Sadhu. “Exacerbation” just means a worsening of your existing condition. And no, it’s absolutely not the end. It’s a sign we need to adjust your treatment, and it can be managed. Many people with heart failure live full and active lives with the right care. And yes, you absolutely should be able to continue taking your regular pills – we may need to adjust the dosages, but we’ll get you back on a stable routine. As for the tea, that’s perfectly fine! Just let the nurse know, and she'll make sure it doesn’t interfere with any of the medications. I’m going to review the test results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss a plan to get you feeling better. The nurse will be in shortly to check your vital signs and start the oxygen. Do you have any pain or discomfort right now?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thank you. Just…tired. And a little bit anxious, I suppose. But no pain. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what’s going on. And knowing that it’s not… the end. I think… I think I can wait for the nurse now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. I'll be back as soon as I have the test results. Just rest and try to take some deep breaths. The nurse will be with you shortly.
