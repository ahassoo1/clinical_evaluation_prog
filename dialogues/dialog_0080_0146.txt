DOCTOR: Hi Edric, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Rosanova. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… well, it’s my muscles. They feel really weak. It started a few weeks ago, and it’s just getting worse, honestly. I don't really know what to make of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness… and it's been progressing over a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing. It started with just feeling tired after normal stuff, you know? Like, carrying groceries felt harder than usual. Now… now it’s like even lifting a coffee cup sometimes is a struggle. It's mostly in my arms and legs, I think. And it feels… all over, kind of? Not one specific spot. It’s just… general weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a gradual onset of weakness, starting with fatigue with normal activity and now impacting even lighter tasks like lifting a cup. Mostly in your arms and legs, but a general feeling overall. Do you notice it more at certain times of the day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it's worse in the evenings, definitely. After work, I just feel… completely drained. And if I’ve been doing anything that requires a bit of effort – even just a lot of walking – it gets much worse pretty quickly. It doesn't seem to be better at any particular time, just… less bad in the mornings, maybe, when I’ve had a good night's sleep. Though even then, it’s still there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the evenings, and exacerbated by activity. Better with rest, but not completely gone even in the mornings. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… other symptoms… Oh! Actually, yeah. I've been feeling really tired all the time, even before the muscle weakness started. Like, beyond just normal tiredness. And… sometimes my hands shake a little. Not a huge shake, but enough to notice it when I’m trying to do something precise, like writing. And… I've been a bit more clumsy than usual, dropping things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue, tremors, and clumsiness along with the weakness. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight… yeah, actually. I’ve lost some weight without trying, I think. Not a lot, maybe five or ten pounds. I haven't been keeping track, to be honest, but my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven't changed my eating habits or anything, so I figured it was just stress, but… maybe it’s connected? I don’t know. I’m not really good at keeping track of that kind of stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss along with everything else. That's helpful. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, chills, or anything like that. Definitely haven't had any night sweats. I've been sleeping okay, all things considered. Just… a lot of sleeping, because I'm so tired. No other… illnesses or anything recently, just the general feeling of being run down. I haven't been sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, night sweats, or recent illness. Just the persistent fatigue and weakness. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven't been to the doctor in… a while, actually. Just for check-ups. I’ve never really needed to go, you know? That’s why this is… concerning. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just over-the-counter stuff if I get a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history, no medications. And you said you haven't been to the doctor in a while. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always avoided them if I could. Everything’s been… straightforward, health-wise, until now. I'm not really the type to… end up in the hospital, if that makes sense. It's a bit worrying, honestly, all this. It feels like something is really wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My dad had some problems with his joints when he got older, arthritis, I think. And my mom… she had high blood pressure. Nothing major, really. My grandparents… I don’t really know much about their medical history, to be honest. They lived back in Yemen, and we didn’t keep in touch a lot. So, not really a strong family history of anything serious, as far as I know. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your father and high blood pressure in your mother. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m not really into any of that. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly, and get enough sleep when I can, but with work… it's hard sometimes. I do drink a lot of coffee, though, if that matters. I need it to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no drugs, and you drink a lot of coffee. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly review your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a problem with medications. I’m pretty lucky that way, honestly. I haven't even had poison ivy or anything like that. Hopefully that hasn’t changed. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if you don’t mind. It's making me a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright Edric, it sounds like we’ve covered a lot of important information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you can? I have to get back to work eventually. I'm already behind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Those are all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Okay, your strength is slightly diminished in your arms and legs, about 4/5 on a scale of 5. That confirms what you've been describing. Now, I’m going to check your gait and balance. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and your balance is a little off. I don't see any obvious muscle wasting at this point, but it's subtle. Your thyroid feels normal to palpation. Based on the exam, the diminished strength, unsteady gait, and your reported symptoms, I think we need to do some further testing. It could be a number of things, from vitamin deficiencies to neurological issues. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, vitamin D level, and a creatine kinase level to check for muscle damage. I also think an MRI of your brain and spinal cord might be helpful, just to rule out anything serious. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot. MRI, blood work… okay. If that’s what you think is necessary, then yeah, sure. Whatever it takes to figure this out. It's just… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I’m not really a fan of hospitals or tests. But I understand. You're the doctor. What’s the next step? When can I expect results? And… will this interfere with my work? I really can't afford to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Edric, and I apologize for the amount of testing, but it’s important to be thorough to get an accurate diagnosis. The next step is to draw the blood. The lab is right down the hall, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. We can schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. It will take about 30-45 minutes. As for results, the blood work usually comes back within 24-48 hours. The MRI results might take a little longer, maybe 2-3 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. I will write a note to your employer explaining that you have some medical appointments, but I won’t disclose any specific details without your permission. We can discuss a potential work excuse if needed. Regarding your work, the MRI might require you to take a half-day off, but we can try to schedule it for a time that minimizes disruption. Do you have any questions about the testing process or the timeline?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds manageable. Half a day off, I guess I can swing that. 2-3 days for the MRI results… alright. And you won’t tell my employer what’s wrong? That’s good. I really appreciate that. No, I think I’m okay for questions right now. Just… I’m a little worried, to be honest. All these tests… it sounds serious. Is there anything I should be… preparing for? Or… anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Like, should I stop working? Should I be resting more? I just… I don't want this to get worse.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to be worried, Edric. The tests are just to rule things out and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’re not jumping to conclusions yet. For now, I wouldn’t make any major changes to your routine. Continuing to work is fine, but please listen to your body. If you feel overly fatigued or your symptoms worsen, take a break. I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, but light to moderate exercise is okay, as long as it doesn't exacerbate your symptoms. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet. There are a few things that could be causing your symptoms, ranging from vitamin deficiencies to neurological conditions. I don’t want to cause any unnecessary anxiety by listing them all now. We’ll discuss everything in detail once we have the test results. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, severe pain, difficulty breathing, or changes in vision – please contact me immediately. Do you have any other concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: Okay. No strenuous activity, stay hydrated, eat well… listen to my body. I can do that. And contact you if anything new happens. No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. You’ve been very… thorough and reassuring, despite all the tests. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. Where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. I understand it's a lot to take in, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 102. The phlebotomist is expecting you. They have your order from me. Just tell them your name and date of birth. After the blood work, you can schedule the MRI at the front desk. They'll give you the necessary paperwork. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I hope the blood work goes smoothly.
PATIENT: Okay. Room 102… I’ll go do that now. Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. Take care. .
