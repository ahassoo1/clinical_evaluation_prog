DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Paes. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, lately I've just been feeling...tired, really tired. And my skin, it’s gotten darker. Not like a sunburn, but just… a deeper color all over. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness and a change in skin color… that’s certainly something we should look into. Let's start with the tiredness. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's been gradual, but I’d say maybe… three or four months ago? It started as just feeling a little more worn out at the end of the day, but now it’s pretty much all the time. Even after a full night's sleep, I don't feel rested.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months… and it’s not improving with rest. Can you describe the tiredness a bit more?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain... it's not just physical, you know? Like, I could do things, I don't feel weak exactly, but I just… don’t want to. It's like all my energy is used up before I even start anything. And focusing is harder too, sometimes. I find myself staring off into space.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your motivation and concentration as well. That’s helpful to know. Now, you mentioned your skin getting darker. Has this been gradual, like the tiredness, or more sudden?
PATIENT: It’s been gradual, definitely. I noticed it first on my hands, I think. And then my face… it just seems like everything is a bit… browner. It’s not patchy or anything, just an overall change. My daughter pointed it out, actually. She said I looked like I'd been spending a lot of time in the sun, but I haven’t really. I work inside, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any itching, pain, or other changes to your skin, besides the color?
PATIENT: No, no itching or pain. It just feels normal, it just… looks different. It doesn't feel rough or anything, like a sunburn would. It's just the color that’s bothering me. It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other symptoms with the skin. Let’s move on to other things. Do you have any other symptoms at all – things like weight loss or gain, changes in appetite, feeling hot or cold, or any unusual bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think... I haven’t really lost or gained any weight, no. My appetite is normal, I guess. Maybe a little less hungry than usual, but not much. And I haven't noticed anything different with… well, you know. As for feeling hot or cold, I’ve been pretty comfortable, temperature-wise. Nothing out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels or appetite alongside any recent stressors or changes in your life?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Work has been a little busier lately, just a lot of extra checks and things. But nothing major, you know? And, um… my mother hasn't been doing well, so I've been trying to help out with her a bit. That’s been a little stressful, worrying about her. But I wouldn’t say it’s overwhelming, just… a concern.
DOCTOR: Okay, some work stress and concern for your mother. We'll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've always been pretty healthy, thankfully. I haven’t really been to the doctor much over the years. Just the usual check-ups. Nothing serious ever diagnosed, anyway. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago! Just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that, I've been pretty lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a bit complicated. My mother… she had some problems with her liver when she was younger, but I don't know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about it much. My father was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And I have two sisters, both are doing well as far as I know. No major illnesses on their end either.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of liver issues with your mother. We’ll make a note of that. And finally, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... I live alone, in a small house near the plant. I don’t smoke, and I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I don't get a lot of exercise, to be honest. Mostly just walking around at work. And I don't spend a lot of time in the sun. I prefer being indoors.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your vital signs and take a look at your skin and eyes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Could you please sit up there for me?
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your vital signs are within normal limits. Your skin shows some increased pigmentation, but no other abnormalities. I don't feel any swelling in your lymph nodes. I'm going to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function tests, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. Vitamin D… I don’t spend much time in the sun, so maybe that’s something. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay. We should have the results back in about 3-5 business days. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as abdominal pain, jaundice , or significant fatigue, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Three to five days, and I’ll call if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I was starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Paes. I understand your concern, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Just try to relax and stay hydrated. I’ll see you back here once the results are in. Here’s a lab requisition form for the blood work. The lab is just across the street. My nurse will give you instructions on fasting requirements, if any, when she calls to schedule your follow-up. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day too.
