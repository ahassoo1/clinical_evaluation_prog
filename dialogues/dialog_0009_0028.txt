DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx, but you can call me Kaelyn. I see here you’re 89 years young. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, dear. It’s nice to meet you as well. Eighty-nine, that's right. Though some days I feel much older! Well, it's this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for…oh, goodness, I’d say a month now, maybe a little longer. And with my heart, you know, I worry.
DOCTOR: Yes, a cough for a month is certainly something we should look into, especially with your heart condition. And it's very wise to be proactive about it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not a…a deep cough, not like when you have a cold, you understand? More of a…dry tickle, really. It comes in little fits and starts. Worse when I lie down, definitely. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. And…sometimes, when I cough, I feel a little bit of…wheezing, I suppose you’d call it. Not all the time, but it happens. I’ve been trying to drink lots of water, like my daughter tells me, but it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry, tickly cough that’s worse when you lie down and sometimes accompanied by wheezing…that’s helpful. And you've been trying to stay hydrated, which is good. Does anything trigger the cough, like dust, perfumes, or cold air?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think. Dust, maybe a little. My house isn't dirty, you understand, but I live in an older home. And…yes! Cold air definitely makes it worse. When I go outside, even if it's not that cold, it starts right up. Perfumes…I don't wear perfumes myself, and my daughter tries to be careful about it when she visits. So, I don’t think so, but maybe if I smell it strongly on someone…yes, that can bother it too.
DOCTOR: Alright, so dust, cold air, and strong smells seem to be potential triggers. That gives us a few clues. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Accompanying the cough… let me see. Sometimes, I get a little short of breath, even just walking around the house. Not bad shortness of breath, just…more than usual. And…oh, my ankles have been swelling up a bit lately. More in the evening, usually. I thought it was just the heat, but… maybe it's connected? And I have been feeling more tired than usual, if I’m being honest. It's just…getting older, I suppose. But maybe it’s more than that.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, ankle swelling, and fatigue… those are all important things to note, and you’re right to bring them up. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? Well, as you know, I have heart failure. It’s been… oh, about ten years now, maybe a little longer. I take medicine for it, of course. A couple of different pills. And I had pneumonia a few years back, a bad case. I was in the hospital for a week. Other than that… I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago. And I have arthritis, in my hands mostly. Makes it hard to do some things, but nothing too serious. I see my regular doctor, Dr. Alvarez, for checkups. He’s a good man. I’m not sure what else… I’m trying to think. Do you need to know about things from when I was younger?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Heart failure, pneumonia, gallbladder removal, and arthritis… I've made notes of all of that. It’s good to know you see Dr. Alvarez regularly. And no, we don’t necessarily need to go into detail about things from when you were younger unless something specific comes up. You mentioned taking medicine for your heart failure. Could you tell me what medications you're currently taking, and how often you take them?
PATIENT: Certainly. Let me see if I can remember… Oh dear, this is where it gets tricky. I have a little pill organizer, but sometimes my daughter refills it and I forget what’s new. I take… Lisinopril, I think that’s right, every morning. That's for the blood pressure, Dr. Alvarez says. And…Furosemide, that's the water pill. I take that every morning too. And then there's…Digoxin, that’s for the heart itself, I believe. I take that once a day, usually in the evening. And… oh, and a little white pill, Metoprolol, for the heartbeat. That’s also once a day. I think that’s everything. But please, double-check with Dr. Alvarez, just to be sure. I don’t want to get anything wrong.
DOCTOR: You’ve done a wonderful job recalling all of those medications – Lisinopril, Furosemide, Digoxin, and Metoprolol. It’s very smart of you to want to double-check with Dr. Alvarez, and I will certainly do that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat all sorts of things, thankfully. I love my daughter’s cooking too much to worry about allergies! No, I don't believe I have any. Though, I used to get a little itchy when I wore certain fabrics, but that was a long time ago. That wasn’t really an allergy, just sensitive skin. No, I’m pretty sure I’m good. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies – excellent. Now, finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that's a bit complicated. My mother, she had high blood pressure, just like me. And my father…he had some heart trouble when he got older, but I don't remember the details. He passed away when I was young. And my sister, she had diabetes. She wasn't very careful about her diet, unfortunately. And my brother…he was healthy as a horse, until he had a stroke a few years back. I don't know if any of that's relevant, but that's what I remember. It's a long time ago, you know. I'm not sure if anyone else had heart problems… it's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. High blood pressure, diabetes, and a stroke in the family… We'll certainly keep that in mind. Alright, Nadene, thank you for providing me with all of this information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you don't mind. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’ve always been a good patient. I’ll just sit here, won't I? Let me know if I need to do anything special. Just try not to startle me with the cold stethoscope! I’m a little jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as gentle as possible. No startling with the stethoscope, I promise. Your blood pressure is 148 over 82. That's a little elevated, but not unexpected given what you’ve told me. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and a bit of crackling in the bases of both lungs. That could be fluid buildup, which is something we’ll need to investigate further. Now, let's take a look at your ankles. I do see some swelling in both ankles, particularly on the inner sides. And when I press here… …there's some pitting edema, meaning it leaves a little indentation when I press. That's consistent with fluid retention. Alright, Nadene. Thank you for your patience. I’ve documented my findings. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I think it’s important to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be willing to do a blood test and a chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood test and a chest X-ray… I'll do whatever I need to do. I just want to feel better. I'm getting too old to be coughing all the time. Just let me know what I need to do, and where I need to go. I can have my daughter take me, if I need a ride. She's very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. I’m glad you’re willing to proceed with the tests. We can draw the blood here in the clinic, and the X-ray can be done across the hall. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I want to address your symptoms and ensure you're as comfortable as possible. I'm going to prescribe a diuretic to help reduce the fluid buildup, and a mild cough suppressant to ease your discomfort. We'll also continue your current medications as prescribed. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, dear. A diuretic and a cough suppressant… I’m happy to try anything that might help. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there are any side effects I should watch out for. And… what about my diet? Should I cut back on salt? My daughter is always telling me I eat too much salt.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question about your diet, and yes, reducing your salt intake is a very important step, especially given the fluid buildup we're seeing. Salt causes your body to retain water, which can worsen your shortness of breath and swelling. I recommend limiting processed foods, which are often high in sodium. Avoid adding salt to your meals, and be mindful of hidden sources of sodium in things like canned soups and sauces. Aim for less than 2000 milligrams of sodium per day. I can provide you with a handout with a list of low-sodium foods if you’d like. As for side effects, the diuretic may cause you to urinate more frequently, so it's important to stay hydrated. And the cough suppressant may cause some drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. If you experience any severe side effects, like dizziness or chest pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions about the medications or the dietary recommendations?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, dear. Less salt, more water, and watch out for dizziness. Sounds sensible enough. A handout would be helpful, though, thank you. It’s hard to remember everything, you know. And… what if the cough doesn't get better? What if the medicine doesn't work?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Nadene, and it's good you're asking. If the cough doesn’t improve after a week or so on the medication, or if it gets worse, we’ll need to investigate further. It could be due to a variety of factors, such as an underlying infection, a reaction to one of your medications, or worsening heart failure. In that case, we may need to consider additional tests, such as a sputum culture to check for infection, or an echocardiogram to assess your heart function. I may also refer you to a cardiologist for a specialist evaluation. For now, let’s focus on starting the medication and following the dietary recommendations. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that sounds perfectly alright. One week, and we’ll see how I’m doing. And the cardiologist if I don't improve. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what to expect. Thank you, Dr. Petrimoulx. You’ve been very kind and helpful. Just let me know what time I need to come back next week. And thank you for the handout.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. I'm glad I could help. Let's schedule your follow-up appointment for next Thursday at 10:30 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, next Thursday at 10:30 sounds perfect, dear. I’ll mark it in my calendar right away. Well, I think that’s everything, isn’t it? Thank you again, Dr. Petrimoulx. You’ve been a great help. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Nadene. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I'll see you next week. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You have a good day as well.
