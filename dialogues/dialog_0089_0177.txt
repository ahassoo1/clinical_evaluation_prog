DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, it's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh… hi. Nice to meet you too, I guess. Well, somethin’s… leakin’. Down there. It’s… not right. Been happenin’ a little while now. Don’t know what to do about it. It’s… gross.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Leaking,” you say. And it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: A little while… hmm. Maybe a week? Two? Time gets away from me, you know? It's not a lot, but it’s… there. When I… use the bathroom, mostly. And it smells kinda funny. Not like… normal. I don’t know what normal is anymore, really. Everything smells the same these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or two, mostly when you use the bathroom, and the odor isn't typical. That’s helpful. Is it urine, more like vaginal discharge, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Urine? No, not like pee. Definitely not pee. It’s… thicker. And kinda… yellow-ish. Not a bright yellow, but… not clear, you know? It’s… hard to explain. I don't really look down there anymore. Too old for that kinda thing. It's just... a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, thicker and yellowish, not urine, and happens when you use the bathroom. I understand. And you’ve noticed it’s causing a bit of a mess. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching along with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little uncomfortable sometimes, but that’s just… bein’ old, I figure. Itchin’… sometimes. A little bit. But not bad. Not enough to complain about. It’s just… annoyin’, you know? Everything’s annoyin’ these days. Used to be simpler.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain, a little bit of discomfort and some mild itching. Okay. And has anything changed recently – new soaps, new laundry detergent, anything like that?
PATIENT: New soaps…? Hmm. Let me think… Oh! My niece, she brought me some of that fancy body wash. Smells like coconuts. I been usin’ that for… maybe a week now, same as the leakin’. Maybe that’s it? It's probably just somethin' silly. Young people and their fancy things. It can’t be good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, the coconut-scented body wash, starting around the same time as the leakage. That’s good information. We’ll definitely consider that as a possibility. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam, if that's alright with you. Just a visual check, and I might take a small sample to send to the lab, just to rule things out and see if we can pinpoint what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A sample…? Oh, dear. I… don't know. I haven’t had anyone… look down there in a long, long time. Seems kinda… invasive. Is it really necessary? Can't you just… tell me what it is? I don't like doctors pokin’ around. Makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Jimmi. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about an exam. And you’re right to ask if it’s necessary. The sample will help us rule out a simple infection, which is a common cause of these symptoms and easily treatable. It’s a quick procedure, and I'll explain everything as I go. It will also help me know what’s going on and recommend the best course of action. We can also talk about alternatives if you’re still uncomfortable. But without a sample, it's harder to be certain. Would you be willing to let me take a look and collect a sample?
PATIENT: Well… I guess. But be quick, okay? And explain everything. Don't just… poke and prod. I don't want any surprises. And… be gentle. My bones ain't what they used to be. But if it's the only way to figure it out… go ahead. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, I absolutely will be gentle, and I'll explain everything as I go. We’ll take it slow. I promise to hurry as much as I can while still being thorough. First, I’ll just need you to lie back on the exam table. I'll use a sheet to cover you for privacy. Then, I'll do a quick visual exam to see what's going on. We’ll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: A speculum…? What’s that…? Is that… is that what they use to… No! No speculum! I don’t want any of that! Just… just look, okay? Don’t stick anything in there. Promise me. I’m serious. I don't want any of those… tools. Just look!
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, absolutely no speculum. I promise. We will not use one. I completely understand, and your comfort is my priority. We will just do a visual exam, and I'll take a swab sample if I can without using any instruments you’re uncomfortable with. We’ll see how much we can gather from that. If you're comfortable, you can lie back now. I'll get you a sheet for privacy. We'll take our time.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. But be careful. I'm an old lady, you know. Everything's… fragile. Just… hurry, please. And tell me what you’re doin’. Don’t just… poke around silently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, I’m just going to take a look. I’m using a light to get a better view. I'm just examining the external area for any redness, swelling, or irritation. It's looking a little red, and there’s some mild discharge that’s yellowish in color. That's consistent with what you described. Now, I'm just collecting a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab. This will tell us if there’s an infection present and what kind of bacteria is causing it. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, all done with the sample. Now, I'm just going to have you sit up, and we'll talk about the next steps. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Done already? Good. That wasn't so bad, I guess. Feels… a little relieved, maybe? Still kinda nervous about what you’re gonna find. What kinda bacteria? Is it… serious? I don't want any of that fancy medicine with all those side effects. My stomach can't handle it. Just tell me straight. Is it gonna make me sick?
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, I understand your worry. The lab will tell us the specific type of bacteria, if any, causing the discharge. The most common causes are bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, both of which are very treatable. We won’t know for sure until the results come back, which usually takes a couple of days. As for medication, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. If it is a bacterial infection, it's usually treated with antibiotics, and we can discuss options that are gentler on the stomach. There are topical creams available, and sometimes oral antibiotics are necessary, but we'll start with the least invasive approach. If it's a yeast infection, it’s treated with antifungal medication, which also has options for creams or oral pills. We’ll consider your stomach sensitivity when making any decisions. I’m ordering the lab tests now. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding scented soaps and douches, and wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they come back, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Cotton underwear… yeah, that’s not a bad idea. My niece buys me those fancy lace things… pretty, but not comfortable. And no fancy soap, got it. A couple of days, huh? Seems like a long time to wait. But… okay. Call me as soon as you know somethin’. And please… no strong medicine. I can’t handle it. Just… simple, okay? Keep it simple. I'm too old for complications.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. We will keep it simple, I promise. We'll start with the least invasive options possible. And I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your tests, so we have the results as quickly as we can. I’ve documented everything and scheduled a follow-up call for two business days from now, August 5th. If anything changes before then – worsening symptoms, increased pain, fever – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For bein’ gentle, and explainin’ everything. And for not stickin’ nothin’ up there. It’s nice to have someone listenin’ to an old lady.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. I'm glad I could help. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
