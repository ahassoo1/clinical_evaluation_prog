DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, my face gets red. Like, really red. It happens sometimes, and it’s… embarrassing. Mostly when I’m talking to people. Not always, though. It’s hard to say when it will happen. It’s been going on… oh, maybe six months now? Not every day, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Six months, you say. Hmm. And is it just your face that gets red, or do you experience any other symptoms with the redness?
PATIENT: Just my face, I think. No… no sweating, or shaking, or anything. Just… hot, and red. Sometimes my neck gets a little warm too, but mostly the face. It doesn’t hurt, it just… feels warm, and looks bad. It makes me want to stop talking, if that makes sense. I don't know why it happens.
DOCTOR: So, purely cosmetic, then. It doesn’t feel unwell, just… inconvenient. And you said it happens when talking to people?
PATIENT: Not always when talking to people. That's what's confusing me! Sometimes it happens when I'm just… thinking. Or reading. It’s… unpredictable. It’s not like I’m scared or anything. I’m a counselor, I talk to people all day! It just… happens. I don't understand it. Is it… something I’m eating, maybe? I eat pretty simple food, mostly. Rice, vegetables… sometimes chicken. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it doesn’t sound like anything serious, thankfully. But unpredictable flushing like that... it could be a number of things. Dietary triggers are always a possibility, but it sounds less likely given what you've described. Are you taking any medications at all, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. I lost my wife… two years ago now. She had a lot of… problems, and a lot of pills. I promised her I wouldn’t, if I didn't need them. And I don't, really. Just… this flushing. It's just annoying. And sometimes embarrassing, like I said. Do you think it could be… nerves, maybe? Even if I don't feel nervous?
DOCTOR: It could be a mild anxiety response, manifesting physically. Though, as you say, you don't feel anxious. It’s not always a conscious feeling, you know?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It's just… I’ve been doing this job for a long time. Talking to people is easy for me. I like helping people. It doesn’t feel like something that would make me nervous. Is there… a test, maybe? To find out what’s causing it? Or… something I can do to make it stop? I don’t want to take pills, but I’m willing to try… something. If it's not too difficult.
DOCTOR: Well, there are tests we could do, but honestly, they're often inconclusive for something like this. A basic blood pressure check, maybe rule out any underlying thyroid issues… but I doubt it's that. Let’s start with a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve always been pretty healthy. Just… this flushing. Okay, a check-up sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle. My skin is a little sensitive. Especially when it's red.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I’ll be as quick as possible. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Not bad. Heart rate is regular. Now, let me take a closer look at your skin… There's some mild redness, as you said, primarily across the cheeks and forehead. No visible rash or blemishes. Skin feels… slightly warm to the touch. Nothing overtly concerning. I'm not seeing anything that jumps out as a specific dermatological condition.
PATIENT: Okay. So… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… something I’m doing wrong? Or… something I just have to live with? I don’t want it to get worse, you know. It’s… unsettling. Especially when I’m with clients. They need to feel comfortable, and I don't want them to think I'm… unwell.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Withycombe, it’s likely nothing serious. It could be a mild form of rosacea, though your symptoms don't perfectly align. Or simply a heightened sensitivity to environmental factors. Stress, even subconscious stress, can trigger these things. I wouldn’t worry too much about it. It’s unlikely to get worse, and it’s certainly not contagious. However, if it does bother you, we can explore some options. A mild topical cream might help reduce the redness. I'll write you a prescription for metronidazole. Use it sparingly, just when you anticipate a situation where you’re likely to experience flushing. It's not a cure, but it can offer some temporary relief. And try to manage your stress levels. Easier said than done, I know. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… okay. I don’t know much about creams, Doctor. Is it… difficult to apply? And will it… make my skin feel different? I have sensitive skin, like I said. As for stress… I try to keep busy. Work keeps me occupied. But… losing my wife… that’s still hard, sometimes. Will the cream help with that, maybe? I know that’s silly… but… it would be nice.
DOCTOR: The cream is quite simple to apply, Mr. Withycombe. A thin layer to the affected areas, once or twice a day as needed. It can cause some mild dryness or irritation in some individuals, but that’s usually temporary. We can start with a small amount and see how your skin reacts. As for your… personal circumstances, I’m afraid a topical cream won’t resolve grief. However, if you are struggling, I recommend seeking support from a bereavement counselor. There are resources available. But, medically speaking, it’s unlikely to have any impact on your emotional wellbeing. Now, do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No… no, I understand, Doctor. Grief… yes, you’re right. It’s… something I have to work through myself. The cream… I’ll try it. Just… to help with the redness. I don’t want to bother you with this anymore. Thank you for listening. And for the prescription. I appreciate it. Is there anything else I need to do? Any special instructions?
DOCTOR: Just apply a small amount as directed, and monitor for any irritation. If it worsens, discontinue use. Otherwise, it’s unlikely to cause any significant issues. No, there's nothing else. I'll see you in a month to see if it’s helping. If it's not, we can explore other options. But honestly, I wouldn’t get too concerned. It’s likely just a minor skin sensitivity. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again. I won’t take up any more of your time. Have a good day. .
