DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. AlCorta. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it's my sight. It’s…diminishing. Not suddenly, mind you, but noticeably. It’s becoming quite inconvenient, really. I used to be able to read the newspaper without straining, and now…well, now it’s a chore.
DOCTOR: Diminishing, you say. And how long has this… inconvenience been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been…gradual, as I said. Perhaps six months, maybe a bit longer? It’s difficult to pinpoint precisely. I don't typically dwell on such things until they become…troublesome. I assure you, Doctor, I haven’t been ignoring it completely. It simply wasn’t urgent until recently.
DOCTOR: Six months. A rather vague timeframe, Mr. AlCorta. And is this diminishing vision in both eyes, or is it localized to one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Though, if I had to venture a guess, it's…worse in my left eye. Not dramatically so, but discernible. I’ve noticed it particularly when I’m trying to read fine print. It’s just…blurrier. It's not a pleasant sensation, I can assure you. I rather pride myself on my attention to detail.
DOCTOR: Blurrier, you say. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this…blurriness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me consider. No…no flashes of light, no pain, no…floaters, I don’t believe. Though, now that you mention it, perhaps a slight…difficulty adjusting when I go from a bright room to a darker one? It's a fleeting sensation, really. Nothing I’d normally bother a doctor about. I suppose I should have mentioned it earlier, but it hardly seemed pertinent.
DOCTOR: Difficulty adjusting… Very well. And do you wear glasses or contacts currently, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My eyesight was always…adequate. I've always been able to see perfectly well enough. It’s rather unsettling, this sudden change, considering I’ve never needed corrective lenses in my life. It makes me question what’s even causing it, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Adequate vision, you say. And your general health, Mr. AlCorta?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn’t say I’m a picture of perfect health, but I’m not…ailing. I used to walk more, but…life gets in the way. I eat reasonably well, I suppose. I enjoy a good steak now and again, though I’ve been trying to cut back. I haven’t been to a proper doctor in… well, a while. Is that relevant? I manage, you see. I always have.
DOCTOR: Manage, yes. Let's proceed with a basic examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of examinations. I always feel rather…exposed. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I can endure it. Please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. And try to relax. It will be a simple visual acuity test. Look straight ahead. I need you to read the smallest line you can on this chart. We’ll start with both eyes open.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, these letters are rather small. And the lighting in here isn’t particularly conducive to clear vision, you know. I suppose I shall attempt it. Ahem. Let me see… is this an 'E'? No, wait… perhaps a 'P'? This is quite difficult, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right eye… 20/40. Left eye… considerably worse. 20/80. Mr. AlCorta, you have significant visual impairment. Now, let me check your peripheral vision. Follow my finger with your eyes, do not move your head.
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? It feels… constricted, Doctor. I’m not seeing your finger as clearly as I should be, I believe. Is it moving to the left now? Or perhaps to the right? It's difficult to discern. Honestly, this whole process is rather disconcerting. Are you certain this equipment is functioning correctly? It seems rather… imprecise.
DOCTOR: The equipment is functioning perfectly adequately, Mr. AlCorta. Your peripheral vision is diminished in both eyes, significantly so in the left. It seems we have enough information for a preliminary assessment. We need to rule out several possibilities. I suspect age-related macular degeneration, but a comprehensive dilated eye exam is necessary. I will provide you with a referral to a specialist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Macular degeneration? That sounds…ominous, Doctor. I’ve heard that can lead to blindness. Is that…likely? And a specialist, you say? Will that be expensive? I don’t have insurance, as you know. This is all rather…unexpected and inconvenient. Frankly, I was hoping for a simple explanation, perhaps just a need for reading glasses. Is there nothing else it could be?
DOCTOR: Mr. AlCorta, I am an Internal Medicine physician, not an ophthalmologist. I can offer a preliminary assessment, but a definitive diagnosis requires a specialist’s examination. While macular degeneration is a possibility, other conditions must be ruled out. As for cost… that is not a medical concern of mine. I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area. I suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Delaying treatment could worsen your condition. Do you require a written referral?
PATIENT: A written referral, yes, please. Though I must say, Doctor, your bedside manner leaves much to be desired. You speak as if I am a particularly troublesome case study, not a… person. And to dismiss my concerns about cost so readily… it’s… insensitive. Very well, a referral then. And perhaps a second opinion wouldn't hurt. I shall inquire with a colleague. Though I sincerely hope this specialist isn't as… abrupt as you.
DOCTOR: Here is the referral. I trust you will find a specialist who meets your… expectations. I've documented my findings. That will be all, Mr. AlCorta. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you… I suppose. Though I remain unconvinced this entire process has been particularly thorough. I wish you a…pleasant day. .
