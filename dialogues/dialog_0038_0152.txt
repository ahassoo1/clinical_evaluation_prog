DOCTOR: Good morning, Chelise. I'm Neeraj Auelua, one of the family doctors here. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Auelua. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol was a little high, so I thought I should get it checked out. Hyper… something, I think the letter said. I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, I see here – hyperlipidemia. That's the high cholesterol. No need to worry too much, it’s very common. We just want to get a better understanding of what’s going on and see what the best course of action is for you. To start, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. I’m glad it’s common. Makes me feel a little better. Let’s see… overall health. Well, I’m 54, and mostly okay, I think. I work as an aerospace engineer, so I sit a lot, but I try to walk when I can. No big health problems, really. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, you know? I've got Medicare, if that’s important. I’m single, so no worrying about anyone else's health right now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Aerospace engineer – that sounds interesting! And good you’re trying to stay active despite the sitting. Medicare is good to know as well. Alright, let’s dig a little deeper. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, never. Not high blood pressure, not diabetes. I get checked at the yearly check-ups, and everything was always fine. I mean, the normal things, you know? Little sniffles, maybe a sore throat, but nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. This cholesterol thing is a bit of a surprise.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And you said you have yearly check-ups - do you recall when your last full physical was?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was… last June, I believe. June of 2024. Doctor Van Derlyn. She retired after that, which is probably why I didn't get a letter about this until now. Maybe she would have caught it sooner? I don't know. It was a pretty standard check-up, blood work and all that. Nothing flagged at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. It's possible Dr. Van Derlyn didn’t catch it then, or it developed since. We’ll get everything checked again today, of course. Now, thinking about your family… do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had high cholesterol, heart disease, or strokes?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me see… my father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. He had a bypass surgery, I think. Maybe in his seventies. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I’m pretty sure. Nothing as serious as my father, though. I don’t really know about my grandparents. They both passed away when I was quite young. I had a brother, but he was adopted, so I don't know his family history at all. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. Knowing about your father's bypass and your mother’s high blood pressure is important. Alright, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I always thought it was a silly habit. And it smells terrible! My father tried it for a while when he was younger, but he quit before it became a problem. I'm quite careful about my health, really. I eat pretty well, mostly vegetables and fish. Not much red meat.
DOCTOR: That's excellent! That's very good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really take any pills, if I can help it. I prefer to deal with things naturally, if possible. A little bit of exercise and a healthy diet, that’s my motto. I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that’s about it. Nothing regular. Just for a little boost when I'm feeling run down.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications. And you said you take a multivitamin occasionally. Alright. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I'm pretty relaxed, so feel free to take your time. I'm just hoping it's nothing too serious, but I'm glad I came in to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the examination table, and we’ll get started. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal here. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and family history do warrant some further investigation. We’ll need to repeat the cholesterol test, and I'd like to order some other blood work as well, just to get a complete picture of your health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. I'm glad you checked everything, and I appreciate you taking your time. Repeating the tests and getting more blood work sounds like a good idea. It’s better to be safe than sorry, right? Will I need to come back another day, or can we do it all today? I don’t mind waiting if it’s not too long. I’m not in a huge hurry.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it’s always better to be thorough. We can do the blood work today. The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn’t take too long. While we're waiting for those results, I’d also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that can help lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. Things like diet and exercise, we’ve already touched on, but we can go into more detail. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I'm very open to that. I'm always willing to learn more about how to improve my health. I already try to eat well and exercise, but maybe I can do more. I’m a bit of a planner, so I like having a list of things to work on. Any suggestions would be great. I’m a good cook, so I’m willing to try new recipes too. And I walk most days, but maybe I should be doing something more strenuous?
DOCTOR: Excellent! That’s a great attitude. Let's start with diet. Focusing on soluble fiber is key. Oatmeal, beans, apples, pears – those are all good choices. Also, incorporating more foods with omega-3 fatty acids – salmon, flaxseed, walnuts – can be beneficial. Limiting saturated and trans fats is important, as those can raise your LDL cholesterol – the “bad” cholesterol. I can print you out a list of foods to focus on, and foods to avoid. As for exercise, aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week is ideal. Walking is great, but incorporating some strength training exercises – lifting weights, doing bodyweight exercises – can also be helpful. Even something as simple as taking the stairs instead of the elevator can make a difference. Does that all sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very manageable. I can definitely do all of that. Oatmeal for breakfast, more fish for dinner, and a bit more walking. I haven't done much strength training since college, but I can probably find some exercises online. I'm not afraid of a little hard work. Printing out a list of foods would be fantastic, thank you. I like having something to refer to. And maybe some links to those strength training exercises too? I'm not sure where to start. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s much easier to understand than all that medical jargon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome! I’m glad I can help. Here you go. This handout includes a list of heart-healthy foods, foods to limit, and some basic strength training exercises with links to instructional videos. While we wait for the lab results, try to focus on these lifestyle modifications. We'll review the results when they come back and discuss any further steps, if necessary. It may also be worthwhile to track your diet and exercise for a week or so, just to get a better understanding of your current habits. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That’s all very clear and helpful. Tracking my diet and exercise is a good idea, I hadn't thought of that. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, Doctor Auelua. And thank you for the handouts. I feel much more confident about managing my cholesterol now. I'll wait here for the lab tech, then. Thank you again!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to let the nurses know if you have any questions while you're waiting. And remember, small changes can make a big difference! Take care, and I’ll see you when the results are back.
