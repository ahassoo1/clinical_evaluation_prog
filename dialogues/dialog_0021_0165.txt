DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it’s this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been… oh, let me think… maybe three times now in the last month? It goes away for a bit, then wham, it’s back again. It’s annoying, to say the least. I just wanna get rid of it, ya know?
DOCTOR: Three times in a month… hm. And what exactly do you mean by fever?
PATIENT: Well, I get real warm, chills, you know? Like when you got the flu, but not as bad. I usually take some Tylenol, and it goes down, but then it just…comes back. I don’t really feel sick sick, just…warm and kinda tired. It’s hard to explain. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It's…vague. "Warm" isn't a temperature, Mr. Brege. Do you have a thermometer?
PATIENT: Yeah, I do. Old-fashioned one, under the tongue. Haven’t used it every time, to be honest. Just kinda felt it out. Last time I did check, it was… 101, maybe? A little over, I think. But like I said, it goes down with the Tylenol. I just don't want this to be somethin' serious, ya know? I gotta get back to work. I'm a chiropractor, keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: A chiropractor…right. And you’ve been working through these fevers?
PATIENT: Well, not during the worst of it, no. I take a day or two when I really feel bad. But it’s been happenin’ on and off enough that it’s cuttin’ into my schedule. I can’t just stop workin’ for a week, doc. People need adjustin’! Look, is this somethin' I should be worried about? That's really what I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s just go through some basics. Any other symptoms with these fevers?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough, no sore throat. No aches, really, except maybe a little tired, like I said. No… rashes, no stomach trouble. I haven't lost any weight, not that I've noticed. Oh! Sometimes my joints feel a little stiff in the mornin’, but I figured that’s just gettin’ old. I’m 65, ya know? That’s about it, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: And your medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell ya, doc. High blood pressure, been on meds for that for years, keeps it under control. Had the flu a couple times, like everyone else. No surgeries, no serious illnesses. I stay pretty active, workin’ with people all day. Married, been with my wife for forty years. She's fine, don't think I caught anythin’ from her. That's pretty much it. Straightforward, ya know? No drama.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at you. Just a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Fine with me, doc. The quicker the better. I got appointments this afternoon. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, if you could just lie down here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your joints. Please let me know if anything is painful. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Some crepitus in the knees, but that's not unexpected with age. No acute swelling or redness. Temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit.
PATIENT: 99.8, huh? Still feelin' kinda warm. So, what do ya think, doc? Is this somethin' I need to worry about? Anythin' serious goin' on? I really gotta get back to work soon. I got Mrs. Henderson comin' in at two, she's dependin' on me.
DOCTOR: It’s likely a viral infection, Mr. Brege. Probably nothing to be overly concerned about. These things happen. But recurring fevers…and your age… We should rule out some things. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Okay, fine. But how long is that gonna take? And do I need to fast or anythin’? I really don’t have time for a whole lot of runaround, doc. I just want this fever gone. Can't I just take some more Tylenol?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, you need to understand that Tylenol only masks the symptoms. It doesn't address the cause. And yes, you do need to fast for eight hours before the blood work. It's standard procedure. I'll give you a requisition form. You can go to the lab across the street. It shouldn't take too long. We'll get the results back in a couple of days. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. And if the fever gets worse, or you develop any new symptoms, you need to come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Eight hours, no food. Got it. I guess I can manage that. But honestly, doc, this is a whole lotta hassle for a little fever. Alright, I'll go get the blood work done. Let's hope it's nothin' serious. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll be in touch. And try to follow the instructions, Mr. Brege. It’s for your own good.
