DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Smetak. Thank you for seeing me. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It’s been bothering me a bit. And, um, the nurse mentioned something about my heart… a funny beat, she said? I don’t really understand it all.
DOCTOR: Alright, a swollen left leg and a…irregular heartbeat, as the nurse put it. Okay. Let's start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… a week ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness. But it’s gotten worse each day, I think. I noticed it properly after I was on my feet all day last Tuesday, grading papers. It’s mostly in my calf, I would say.
DOCTOR: Grading papers… so prolonged standing. And has this swelling been constant since Tuesday, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty constant, yes. It’s better when I put my feet up, but as soon as I’m walking about or standing, it gets bigger again. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels… heavy, and a bit achy, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy and achy. Alright. And have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s just… bigger. And a bit discolored, maybe? It’s hard to tell, because my skin is quite pale normally. But it doesn’t feel hot, and there’s no redness, no. It just looks… puffier than my other leg.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's take a look at the leg, and then we can talk a bit more about this irregular heartbeat the nurse mentioned. If you don’t mind, would you mind lying down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. No problem at all. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. It’s a bit high, perhaps?
DOCTOR: There we go. Is that better?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s much better, thank you. I hope you don’t mind, I’m not very flexible. I spend a lot of time sitting down, you see, marking papers.
DOCTOR: Not at all. Plenty of sitting is perfectly understandable. Now, let’s see… Yes, I can definitely see some swelling in your left calf compared to your right. And… hmm, there is some pitting edema present. It feels warm to the touch, though not significantly so. No noticeable redness. Does this feel tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, that’s a bit uncomfortable, actually. Not terribly painful, but… definitely noticeable. It feels… squishy, I suppose? Is that what ‘squishy’ means, Doctor? I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: "Squishy" is a perfectly good description, Nixon. It helps me understand what you're feeling. That tenderness and the squishiness… alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay. It feels a bit strange, but I’ll try to be still. As I said, the nurse mentioned something about it beating funny. I don't really know what that means, though. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, I do hear a bit of an irregularity. It’s not… alarmingly irregular, but it’s definitely not a perfectly regular rhythm. It's hard to say definitively what's causing it without further investigation. There are many reasons for an irregular heartbeat, and it doesn’t always mean there's something serious going on. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart problems before?
PATIENT: No, never. As far as I know, my heart’s always been… normal. I’ve never had any tests done or anything. My family… my mother has high blood pressure, but that’s all I can think of. And I get a bit breathless sometimes, when I walk up hills, but I just thought I was a bit unfit. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and a family history of high blood pressure… alright. Okay, Nixon, based on what you've told me and my initial examination, we need to do a few things to figure out what's going on. The swollen leg and the irregular heartbeat could be related, or they could be separate issues. It’s possible the swelling is due to a blood clot, though we need to rule that out. And the irregular heartbeat needs to be investigated further. I’m going to order a few tests. First, a D-dimer blood test to check for blood clots. Then, an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to get a more detailed look at your heart’s rhythm. And finally, a complete blood count to get a general overview of your health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think that’s what’s needed, then yes, please. A D-dimer, an ECG, and a… complete blood count. Will these tests be painful, Doctor? And how long will it take to get the results? I have lectures to give next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss them.
DOCTOR: No, none of those tests should be painful. The D-dimer is just a blood draw, like getting a routine check-up. And the ECG is completely non-invasive – we just attach some sticky pads to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes a couple of days for the lab to get them back to me. I’ll call you as soon as I have them and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I want you to try and elevate your leg as much as possible. Avoid prolonged standing, and if you notice any sudden increase in pain or redness, or if you develop any chest pain or shortness of breath, go to the nearest emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Elevate my leg, avoid standing, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Sticky pads and a blood draw. That doesn’t sound too bad. And you'll call me when you have the results. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very reassuring. I suppose I should go and get those tests done now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The nurse will give you the requisitions for the tests, and she’ll direct you to the nearest lab. Once you’ve had them done, just let me know if you have any questions. And remember, if anything changes, or if you feel worse, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. I'll write up a summary for you to take with the requisitions. It outlines everything we’ve discussed and the tests you need to have done. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. A summary to take with the requisitions… that’s helpful. Just… thank you again, Doctor Smetak. I was quite worried, but I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on, or at least, knowing what you're trying to find out. I appreciate your time. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. That’s what I’m here for. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. Take care of yourself, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
