DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, dear. What brings me in… well, it’s this unsteadiness, I suppose. I’ve been… feeling off balance. It’s difficult to explain, and honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. I just feel like I might fall sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling off balance and experiencing unsteadiness can be quite concerning. It’s alright if it’s difficult to explain, we’ll take our time. And don’t worry about your memory; we can work around that. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. Um… well, it doesn’t happen all the time. More when I'm… moving, I think? Like, walking. Or if I stand for a long time. It’s not a spinning feeling, exactly… more like my feet aren't quite… stable. Does that make any sense? I work… I do work outside, quite a bit, with heavy machinery. Perhaps it's related?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Lilyanna. It’s helpful to know it’s more pronounced with movement and standing, and that it doesn’t feel like spinning. And it’s good you’ve already considered your work as a potential factor – that’s very astute. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s… difficult. It feels like it’s been… building, slowly. Perhaps… six months ago? No, maybe a little longer. After… after my husband passed. Everything feels a bit blurry around then, honestly. It’s not a sudden thing, if that makes sense. It just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly normal for things to feel blurry during times of grief. It’s not surprising that you might not have a precise timeline. “Gradually getting worse” is very helpful to know. Now, besides the unsteadiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No… not really. I’ve been a bit… tired, perhaps? But that could just be the work, honestly. It’s quite physical. No dizziness, no headaches, no blurred vision… nothing like that. I haven’t fallen, thankfully. Just… a feeling like I might. And sometimes a bit… off. A bit unsure of my footing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No dizziness, headaches, or blurred vision is helpful. And it’s reassuring you haven’t fallen yet, although the feeling of being off balance is concerning, as you said. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t think so. I had… the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Until… recently, of course. My husband… he was the one with the medical issues, not me. I took care of him more than I needed taking care of myself, if you know what I mean. I have private insurance, though, so that’s good.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. It sounds like you were very dedicated to your husband's care. That’s admirable. And it’s good to know you have private insurance. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No surgeries. Never had the need, thankfully. Just… routine check-ups, when my husband was well enough to… to make me go, you know? He was very insistent on preventative care. But no major procedures, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No surgeries. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was young. And I… I didn’t know my father very well. We weren’t close. As for conditions… I don't really know. My mother… she had some heart trouble, I think. But beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t be much help. We didn't really talk about those things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have a lot of information about your family history. It’s common for those details to be unknown. Heart trouble in your mother is good to note, though. Now, just a few more questions. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. Never have, really. I’ve always been a firm believer in… well, in letting the body heal itself, if possible. That's why I'm a bit worried about this unsteadiness. It's unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I remember being quite a picky eater as a child, but my husband always said I’d try anything once!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know, Lilyanna. No known allergies. Alright, Lilyanna, thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to assess your balance and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to… figure out what’s going on. And hopefully, get this unsteadiness sorted out. It's unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilyanna. It's perfectly reasonable to want answers and get this sorted out. If you wouldn’t mind, could you please stand on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's a bit… high. But I can manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lilyanna. I’m going to ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just try to maintain your balance for as long as you can. I’ll be right here to support you if you need it. Okay, go ahead when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright… here goes. It's… wobbly. Very wobbly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that's alright. You can open your eyes now. You did well. There is some mild unsteadiness, as I suspected. I’m noting that you have difficulty maintaining balance with your eyes closed, which suggests a possible proprioceptive issue – meaning there may be a problem with your body’s awareness of its position in space. Now, could you please walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, like you’re walking on a tightrope?
PATIENT: This is… difficult. I’m trying, Doctor, but it feels… uneven. I'm wobbling a bit. Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that's alright. You can stop when you need to. I’m noting some mild ataxia - a lack of coordination - with this test as well. It’s subtle, but present. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs. This will just involve a gentle tap with a small hammer. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. A hammer? Oh dear. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I’m… bracing myself. Just let me know if it’s going to be… a hard tap.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna. Everything appears normal there. Reflexes are present and symmetrical. Based on the exam findings - the mild unsteadiness, difficulty maintaining balance with your eyes closed, and subtle ataxia - it could be a number of things. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but it warrants further investigation. The subtle ataxia concerns me slightly. It could be related to a number of things, including inner ear problems, certain medications , or, less commonly, neurological issues. It's important to rule those out. I'd like to order a few tests, if you’re agreeable. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, a vitamin B12 level, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An MRI? That sounds… rather serious. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. Whatever you recommend. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get this sorted out. Blood tests and… a brain scan. That’s… a lot. But alright.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Lilyanna. It is a lot, and I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary to get to the bottom of this. An MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain and help us rule out any serious causes. It's a precaution, really. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the imaging center will contact you to schedule the MRI. They’ll need your insurance information. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could increase your risk of falling. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, headache, weakness, or vision changes – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers it. It's a lot to process, to be honest. Blood tests and a brain scan. Oh dear. But alright. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very thorough. And… kind. I appreciate that. I suppose I'll just… wait for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, find a solution. Here’s a summary of the tests and my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And again, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. I wish you all the best, Lilyanna. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I suppose I'll just… go home and wait. Thank you again. .
