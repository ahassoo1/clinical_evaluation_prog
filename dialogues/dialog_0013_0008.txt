DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello. Right. My… ears. They feel blocked, sort of full. It’s been… a while, I think. Not painful, just… stuffy. I don’t really… remember when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, blocked ears, not painful, just a feeling of fullness. And you’re not sure exactly when it started – that’s alright, we can try to narrow it down. Has this happened before, do you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm. Possibly? I get… a lot of things. My wife… she always remembered these things. I think maybe once or twice, but it’s all a bit… fuzzy. It doesn't really bother me too much, usually. Just annoying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, so potentially a recurring issue, but not consistently. And it’s mostly an annoyance rather than causing significant problems. Have you noticed it getting worse recently, or is it pretty stable?
PATIENT: Stable, I think. Or… maybe a little worse? It’s hard to say. Everything feels a bit… muffled, you know? Like talking underwater. I mostly just turn the television up louder. My neighbor probably hates me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some muffled hearing alongside the fullness, and you've been compensating by increasing the volume. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or any pain at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… no, I don’t think so. Dizziness… sometimes I feel a bit unsteady, but I put that down to… well, getting older, mostly. And no pain, definitely not. Just… the stuffiness. It’s really quite irritating when I’m trying to hear people. Especially when they mumble.
DOCTOR: Alright, no ringing or pain, and the dizziness you attribute to age. Just the fullness and difficulty hearing. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do. Honestly, I just want to get this sorted and be on my way. Is there a… a quick fix for this, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re hoping for a quick solution. We’ll see what we find. Okay, looking in your left ear now… Hmm. There's a bit of cerumen buildup, some earwax, but nothing major. Now the right ear… Okay, a little more cerumen on this side, and the eardrum looks a little… dull. Not bulging or retracted, thankfully. It just doesn't have the normal pearly grey sheen. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… I used to be allergic to cats, I think. When I was a boy. But I haven’t been around cats in… decades. My wife always handled that sort of thing. I don't really… pay attention to those details. Honestly, I wouldn't know. Do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a potential history of cat allergy but nothing current that you're aware of. That’s helpful to know. And just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they act up. That's it, I believe. Nothing else. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Is this important? Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking medication for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That’s good to know. We are getting somewhere. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you likely have a build-up of earwax – cerumen impaction – contributing to the fullness and muffled hearing. The dull appearance of your eardrum supports that. We can try to remove the wax and see if that improves things. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please. Get rid of it. Whatever "it" is. As long as it doesn't hurt. And it's quick, right? I really need to… get going. What does removing the wax involve, exactly? Is it… complicated?
DOCTOR: Okay, it’s not complicated at all. We have a few options. We can try earwax softening drops that you use at home for a few days, then come back for a check-up. Or, we can do a gentle ear irrigation in the office – essentially rinsing the wax out with warm water. The irrigation is usually faster, but some people find the sensation a little uncomfortable. I have the equipment here if you'd prefer that route. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm. Irrigation sounds… quicker. If it’s not too painful, let’s just get it done. I don’t really want to be coming back for another appointment. Just… please be gentle. And tell me if it’s going to sting or anything. I hate surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Gentle and no surprises, absolutely. I’m going to warm up some water to body temperature. Then, using this syringe, I’ll gently flush your ear canal with the water. It might feel a bit strange, like pressure, and you might hear some bubbling sounds. I'll stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. We’ll start slowly and see how you tolerate it. Let me know if anything feels off, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Just… be quick about it, please. This is a bit unnerving, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting with your right ear now. Just relax and try to breathe normally. Alright, I'm seeing some wax coming out... continuing... Okay, a little more… Alright, that seems to have removed the bulk of it. Let's take a look… Okay, the eardrum looks much better now! Nice and pearly grey. How does that ear feel?
PATIENT: Hmm. It… feels lighter, I suppose. Not as blocked. I can hear you a bit clearer. Still a bit muffled, but definitely better. It’s… a relief, actually. Can we do the other one now? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. We’ll repeat the process on your left ear. Alright, same as before, just relaxing and breathing normally. Gentle flushing with warm water… Okay, a little more wax coming out… And a little more… Okay, I think that's done. Let's take a look… Excellent. Your left eardrum looks much clearer now too. How does that ear feel compared to the first one?
PATIENT: It feels… normal. Almost. I can hear you perfectly now. It’s… remarkable. I didn’t realize how much I was straining before. Thank you. Honestly, I feel like a weight has been lifted. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… can I go? I really appreciate it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander! I'm glad we could get that sorted out for you. For now, just avoid getting water in your ears for a couple of days. If you experience any pain, discharge, or decreased hearing, please give us a call. Otherwise, just keep an eye on it. I recommend following up with your primary care doctor for routine checkups. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, no questions. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate your patience. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Leander. Have a wonderful day!
