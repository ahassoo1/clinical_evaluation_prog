DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it's not really a problem, you see. My daughter, she says I should come get a… a card from you? A “get well” card, she called it. Even though I feel perfectly fine. It’s just… she worries too much. And she said having a note from a doctor would… encourage my husband to stop fussing over me. He's retired now, and has way too much time on his hands.
DOCTOR: Ah, so a bit of a wellness check, with a side of family diplomacy! That's perfectly alright. It sounds like you’re in good spirits, which is excellent. Just to be thorough – and to have everything on record – let's just go through a quick check-up. It won't be extensive, just some basic questions. First, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? Well, I work. I assemble things at the factory, you know? Keeps me busy. And I cook for my husband. Nepali food, mostly. Very healthy, lots of vegetables. I don't feel sick. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, years and years. Probably not since my daughter insisted on check-ups for her when she was a little girl. I’m strong, you see. Look at me! I don't get colds or anything like that. It's all this worrying from my family, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear – staying active is fantastic, and a healthy diet is wonderful. And it sounds like you're generally quite robust, which is great. Just to cover all bases – and again, this is routine – have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? No, not really. Maybe a little less, if anything. My daughter keeps saying I’m too thin, but I feel fine. It’s just… when you get older, things shift, you know? You don't fill out the same way. My husband makes such a fuss if I skip a meal, though. Always offering me snacks. It's very sweet, but… unnecessary. Honestly, I haven’t weighed myself properly in ages. Probably for the best. It's just a number, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're right, it is just a number, and feeling well is the most important thing. Okay, and have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? No, not really. I eat when I’m hungry, I don’t force it. Like I said, my husband worries if I don’t finish everything on my plate, so I try to eat a decent amount to keep him happy. But I don’t crave anything special, or feel like I’m losing my appetite. It’s pretty normal, I think. We eat very simply. Dal bhat, mostly. Good, wholesome food. Not all this… processed stuff you see these days. Honestly, it's all this fussing that’s making me feel… distracted.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very balanced diet, and a very attentive husband! Alright. Now, sometimes even when people feel well, there can be underlying things going on. Just to be completely thorough, have you experienced any fatigue or unusual tiredness recently?
PATIENT: Tiredness? No, not really. I work, don’t I? At the factory. It's a busy job, standing all day, assembling things. It keeps me moving. If anything, I'm tired from work, not tired in a… sick way, you see? I sleep well enough. My husband, he’s always early, making tea, but I sleep. A good eight hours, usually. I don't understand why I'm here, honestly. My daughter, she’s always been… anxious. It's just a card, isn't it? A silly card.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're very active and have a good sleep routine, which is excellent. Alright, just a couple more quick questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a question. Well, you know… normal. Everything is… regular. I eat a lot of vegetables. Fiber, you see. Keeps things moving. I don't want to discuss this with a… a doctor. It's a bit… personal, isn't it? Honestly, my daughter sends me here for the strangest things. A card! I feel perfectly healthy. It’s just… a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t want to discuss it further. Let's move on then. Have you experienced any difficulty with your memory or concentration lately?
PATIENT: Memory? Oh, don’t even ask. I remember everything. Everything my daughter has ever done, everything my husband said this morning, every single detail of the factory… I remember it all! It’s more of a problem having too much memory, if you ask me. Always remembering things that are best forgotten. But no, I don't have trouble remembering things. My daughter… she worries I’ll forget where I put my glasses, but I haven't lost them yet, have I? It's just… frustrating, being asked these silly questions. I came for a card, Doctor, not a… a life review.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful – a good memory is a blessing! Alright. Now, just one final question, and then we can do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough, and then get you that card. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss or gain? Doctor, we’ve already discussed this! I said, maybe a little less weight, if anything, but that's just because… well, I'm getting older. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more, but I feel perfectly fine. Honestly, it's like you’re not even listening to me. I came here for a card, a silly little get-well card to appease my husband and daughter. I feel healthy. I am healthy. Do you need to check my pulse or something? Because if that’s all, let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I apologize – it seems I was repeating myself. You’ve been very clear about your health, and I’m very sorry for not listening more carefully. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to confirm everything you’ve told me – pulse, blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Then I can write you a note for your husband and daughter, confirming you're in good health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I have things to do. Cooking, you know. My husband expects dinner on time. Just… don't ask me about my bowels again. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course not. Alright, let's start with your pulse and blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… Your pulse is 78, regular and strong. Your blood pressure is 122/70, which is perfectly normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… Your heart sounds strong and regular. Lungs are clear… No wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good. Alright, everything sounds perfectly healthy. As you said, your heart and lungs sound strong, and your blood pressure is normal. I'm happy to confirm you’re in good health.
PATIENT: Good. Now, about that card… Is it a nice one? My daughter likes those floral ones. And could you write something encouraging? About how I’m strong and healthy? Just so she stops worrying so much. Honestly, it’s all this fussing that makes me feel unwell, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. I’ve written a note confirming you're in good health, and I’ve added a sentence about how you're active and strong, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. It’s a floral design, just like your daughter likes. It sounds like your husband and daughter are very loving, but perhaps a little overprotective. Remember, it’s perfectly alright to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being. If their worrying becomes too much, don’t hesitate to let them know. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Floral. She'll like that. No, I suppose not. This… this will do. It's just a card, after all. But honestly, Doctor… you should tell people to stop fussing so much. It's very bad for the health, you know. Constant worrying. Thank you… I think. .
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. It's important to prioritize peace of mind. Please take care of yourself, Janeth. And don't hesitate to schedule another appointment if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day. .
