DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit… worrying, to be honest. I’ve been noticing some weakness, especially in my muscles, and my eyelids have started to droop. It's been getting worse over the last few months, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids… that certainly warrants investigation. “Worsening over the last few months” is helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the weakness a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started, I believe, with my arms. Just feeling… tired, easily fatigued when I was doing things around the house. Lifting things felt harder than it should. Now, it’s also in my legs, a bit. Walking longer distances is… more effort. It’s not painful, exactly, just… heavy. And it seems to be worse later in the day. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Schaust. You're describing it very well, actually. “Easily fatigued” and “heavier” later in the day are important clues. It sounds like the weakness is progressive, which is why you were right to come in. Now, to help me narrow things down, could you tell me if this weakness is symmetrical?
PATIENT: Symmetrical? I… I don’t think I know what that means in this context, Doctor. Could you perhaps explain it a little differently? I apologize for my ignorance.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schaust, it’s my job to explain things clearly. By symmetrical, I mean: is the weakness the same on both sides of your body?
PATIENT: Ah, okay, I understand now. Yes… I believe it is. Both arms feel about equally weak, and my legs feel the same too. It’s not like one side is significantly worse than the other, no. It’s… uniform, I suppose. Though, sometimes I think my right arm feels slightly more tired, but it could just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. “Uniform” is a good way to put it. And it's good you're able to distinguish subtle differences, even if they seem minor. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired overall, even when I’ve had enough sleep. And… this is a bit strange, but my vision has been a little blurry sometimes. Not constantly, but it happens. Also, I’ve noticed I have a harder time swallowing than I used to. It’s not severe, just… I need to concentrate a bit more to get food down. Does that sound concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are all potentially relevant symptoms, Mr. Schaust, thank you for sharing them. Increased fatigue, blurry vision, and difficulty swallowing… yes, those do warrant further investigation. To clarify the vision issues, is the blurriness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not there all the time. It seems to be worse in the evening, actually, when I'm feeling more tired. And sometimes, if I look to the side, it's a little more noticeable. It’s difficult to explain… it’s not like everything is a blur, just… a slight distortion, occasionally. It hasn't been interfering with my daily life too much, but it’s still a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: "Worse in the evening" and "when looking to the side"... that's important. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and chickenpox, but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I did have a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that was it. And… well, I was divorced about six months ago. If that’s relevant?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schaust. Emotional stress can certainly impact one’s health. But medically, it doesn't seem to be directly relevant to your current concerns. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications at all. I try to avoid them if possible. I sometimes take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as it's quite dark here in Sweden, but that’s the only thing. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, to be honest. It’s just… this weakness is worrying me.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Schaust. And a healthy lifestyle is always a positive. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… well, she had some problems with her heart later in life, but I don't know the specifics. She passed away a few years ago. My father is still alive, and he’s generally healthy, though he has arthritis in his knees. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, I believe she had some form of… muscle weakness when she was older, but I never knew the details. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it. I'm afraid that’s all I know, Doctor. It's not a very helpful answer, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schaust. Any information is helpful, and you've provided what you know. Muscle weakness in your grandmother, even without specifics, is something we’ll keep in mind. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean, Doctor? I hope it’s not too personal. I'm still a bit unsure what sort of information you require. I work as a facilities manager, as you know, and I live alone. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! It’s not personal. I’m simply trying to get a broader picture of your lifestyle. Your work is helpful. I’m interested in things like your diet, level of physical activity outside of work, and any potential exposure to toxins or unusual substances. Do you have any hobbies that involve physical exertion?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. Well, my diet is… fairly standard, I suppose. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I don’t eat a lot of processed foods. As for physical activity, I try to go for a walk most evenings, but other than that, I don't do much. I used to play football when I was younger, but I haven’t played in years. And no, I don't have any hobbies that involve exposure to toxins or unusual substances. I work in office buildings, mostly, ensuring everything is running smoothly. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m a bit worried I’m not giving you enough information.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, just one more question regarding your history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I haven’t had any problems with insect bites or pollen, or anything like that. I think… I think that’s everything, Doctor. I’ve tried to answer your questions as honestly and completely as possible. Is there anything else you need to know before you examine me? I’m starting to feel a little anxious, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schaust, that’s excellent. You’ve been very forthcoming, and I appreciate your patience. We have a good starting point. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. We’ll start with your neurological function, checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a general examination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. I trust your judgment, of course. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let’s begin. Could you please sit comfortably and relax your arms in your lap?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, I’m going to assess your muscle strength. Please resist me as I try to push your arm down. Don’t strain yourself, just apply steady pressure. Not bad. A little weak, but not significantly. Now, let’s try this again with your other arm. Slightly weaker on this side, as expected. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are present and equal bilaterally. Now, let’s check your cranial nerves. Please follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. Eye movements are intact. Now, could you please open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Ah… I hope I’m doing this correctly, Doctor. It feels a little strange.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Schaust. Everything is normal so far. Now, let's move onto your legs. Could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: I'm assessing for muscle weakness and tenderness. Please resist me as I try to bend your knees. Not bad, but a little weaker than expected. Now, let’s try that on the other side. Similar weakness on this side. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes again, this time at your ankles. Achilles reflexes are present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, let’s check your gait. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is that alright? I feel a little clumsy, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. I see a slight waddle and some mild instability. Now, could you please stand still for a moment and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Do you feel any unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a little bit. Not severe, but I can definitely feel a slight wobble. It's more pronounced when I close my eyes. I feel… a little dizzy, actually. Nothing major, but I wouldn’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, thank you. That’s enough for the physical examination for now. Based on my findings – generalized muscle weakness, diminished reflexes, slightly unsteady gait, and a subtle wobble when closing your eyes – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. However, these findings can be caused by a variety of factors. I’m going to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to investigate further. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Neurological issue… that sounds… serious, Doctor. What sort of neurological issue are you thinking of? And an MRI… is that something I should be worried about? What are we looking for, exactly? I… I’m a little scared, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schaust, and it's perfectly natural to be scared. It’s important to remember that we are still in the early stages of investigation, and these tests are simply to help us determine the cause of your symptoms. There are several possibilities we need to rule out, including multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, or a vitamin deficiency. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and spinal cord, looking for any abnormalities or lesions. The blood tests will check for certain antibodies and vitamin levels. It's too early to make a definitive diagnosis without these results. We're doing this to be thorough and ensure we get the right treatment for you. I will explain everything in detail once we have the results, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions I can address?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… that sounds… frightening. Is that a common possibility? And myasthenia gravis… I’ve never even heard of that. What sort of treatment would be involved if it is one of those things? And how long will it take to get the results? I… I’m worried about leaving everything hanging, not knowing what’s going on. It’s difficult to function when you don’t know what you’re dealing with.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schaust. It’s frustrating to be in a state of uncertainty. Multiple sclerosis is a possibility, but it’s not the only one. It affects the central nervous system and can cause a variety of symptoms, as you’ve experienced. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. The treatment for both conditions varies depending on the severity and specific symptoms. For MS, there are disease-modifying therapies to slow the progression, as well as medications to manage symptoms. For myasthenia gravis, treatment often involves medications to improve muscle strength and suppress the immune system. The blood tests should be back within a few days, and the MRI results usually take about a week. I will contact you immediately as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. I also want to reassure you that we will explore all possible options and work together to find the best course of action. Do you have any other questions, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I understand, Doctor. It's just… a lot to take in. Avoiding strenuous activity and getting rest… that sounds reasonable. I suppose I just need to wait. And hope for the best. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It helps to know what to expect, even if it’s not good news. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any specific symptoms that would warrant a call to the clinic before the results come back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and I’m here to support you through this. Yes, there are a few things to watch out for. If you experience any sudden worsening of your weakness, difficulty breathing, double vision, or significant changes in your coordination or balance, please contact the clinic immediately. Also, if you develop a high fever or any new neurological symptoms, such as numbness or tingling, please seek medical attention right away. Otherwise, try to remain calm and focus on getting rest. We will discuss the results as soon as they are available and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI and a lab requisition for the blood tests. Do you have any questions about those, or would you like me to explain the process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. A referral for the MRI and a lab requisition… I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and your thoroughness. It’s… reassuring to know I’m in good hands. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
