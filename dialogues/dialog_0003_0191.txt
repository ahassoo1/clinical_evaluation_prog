DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, if you could tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided to come in… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while now, and I thought it was best to just… get it done, you know? I haven’t been feeling unwell, but better safe than sorry, as they say.
DOCTOR: I see. A proactive approach, commendable, though frankly, a bit unnecessary if you’ve been maintaining a… responsible lifestyle. Nevertheless. Do you have any particular concerns that led you to request this testing now?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I… that's a fair question, Doctor. My husband and I… we’ve been together a very long time, but we haven’t… been as careful recently as perhaps we should have been. It’s just… life gets in the way, you know? And with everything going around, I just wanted to be certain. It’s not that I think anything has happened, but… peace of mind, really.
DOCTOR: “Peace of mind.” Right. And have you ever been tested previously, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly don’t recall, Doctor. It was… a long time ago, perhaps in my younger days. Before I met my husband, I suppose. But I couldn't say for certain. It wasn't something I made a habit of, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Well, we will proceed as if this is your first test, then. To ensure accuracy, I’ll need to ask a few routine questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. Though I do try to avoid too much sugar these days, but that’s a personal preference, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. It's nothing fancy, just a cream I rub on my hands and knees. It's called… let me think… FlexAll, I believe. And sometimes, when it’s particularly bad, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But that's it, really. Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Topical cream and occasional ibuprofen. Fine. And what about your medical history, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Well, I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. And as I mentioned, the arthritis has been bothering me for a few years now. The doctor said it’s just wear and tear, really. I also had a… a rather difficult childbirth with my daughter, but that was a long time ago, and I recovered well. No major surgeries or anything like that. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Just establishing a baseline, Ms. Shaub. Now, briefly, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit difficult to say, Doctor. My mother passed away when I was quite young, from… a fever, I believe. And my father… he didn’t really talk much about his side of the family. I know my grandmother had some problems with her heart, but beyond that, I don’t have a great deal of information, I’m afraid. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, a rather sensitive question, Ms. Shaub, but necessary. Have you ever engaged in any… high-risk behaviors?
PATIENT: Oh. Doctor, I… well, as I said, my husband and I have been together a very long time. We’ve always been faithful to each other. But… recently, we haven’t been as… cautious as perhaps we should have been. I wouldn't characterize it as "high-risk," but… perhaps not entirely safe either. It’s not something I’m proud of, but I wanted to be upfront and honest with you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with the physical examination, then. I'll need to take a blood sample, and possibly a urine sample as well. Standard procedure. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I understand. A blood sample and a urine sample, yes. It's… it's alright. I suppose I'm a little nervous, but I trust your judgement. Where would you like me to start?
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We'll start with the blood draw. I’ll need to locate a vein in your arm. Please, relax your arm for me. Nurse will be in shortly with the equipment. I trust you’ve maintained adequate hydration?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I always try to drink plenty of water, especially with this weather. I had a large glass with my breakfast this morning. I believe I’m quite well hydrated, thank you for asking. I wouldn't want to make things difficult for the nurse!
DOCTOR: Good. That will be all for now. Please remain seated. The nurse should be with you shortly. Try to remain calm. This is a standard procedure. .
