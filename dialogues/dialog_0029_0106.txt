DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, really. A nasty one, and it just won’t heal. I’ve had diabetes for years, you see, and the nurse told me that's probably why it’s so slow to get better. It’s on the bottom of my left foot, near my heel.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on the bottom of your left foot near the heel that's not healing, and you have a history of diabetes. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the sore itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a pretty sight, let me tell you. It's…red, naturally. And it weeps a bit. Not constantly, but it gets…damp. And it’s tender. Very tender. I have to be so careful how I walk. I used to be able to walk anywhere, you know. Now…not so much. It’s been like this for…oh, I don’t know, maybe a month or so? Longer? It all blurs together, to be honest. I try to keep it clean, but it just doesn't seem to help.
DOCTOR: Alright, red, weeps a little, very tender, and has been present for about a month or longer. You're doing the right thing by keeping it clean. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or any redness or swelling around the sore, spreading up your foot or leg?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. I don’t bother with all that unless I’m really sick. Chills…no, not that I recall. Swelling…well, my ankles are always a bit puffy, to be honest. It’s the age, I suppose. But around the sore itself? No, not really. It's mostly just…the sore. A rather stubborn sore. It doesn't seem to be getting bigger, thankfully. It's just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, ankles are generally puffy, but no spreading redness around the sore itself, and it hasn't gotten significantly larger. That's helpful. Now, do you have any pain in your legs or feet when you're not walking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not usually, no. Except sometimes at night. My legs get a little…restless, and there's a sort of ache. But I just put that down to being old! I’ve always had aches and pains. It's not constant, mind you. And it doesn't really feel like it's coming from the foot, specifically. More like…deep in my legs. I usually just move them around a bit and it goes away. It’s nothing like the pain in the foot, though. That’s a different sort of agony altogether.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent leg discomfort at night, more of an ache than a sharp pain. Now, let's talk about your diabetes. Do you check your blood sugar regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The nurse drilled that into me. I check it every morning and every evening, like clockwork. I write it down in a little book, too. It’s usually…well, it fluctuates, of course. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not so good. I try to eat right, you know. Not too much sugar. But it’s hard. Everything tastes so much better with sugar! And sometimes I just…indulge. My numbers have been a bit higher lately, I think. That is, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, you check your blood sugar twice a day and have noticed it's been a bit higher recently. That’s good that you’re monitoring it. Do you know what your most recent A1C was?
PATIENT: A1C? Honestly, no. They tell me the number when I have the blood test, but it goes in one ear and out the other. All those medical numbers…they just don't stick with me. I know it’s supposed to be important, but I haven’t the foggiest idea what it was last time. I just know if the nurse looks at me with that expression, it wasn't very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't recall your most recent A1C. That’s alright, we can look it up in your records here. Okay, I see your last A1C was 7.8% three months ago. That is a little elevated. Now, let's take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, that number…7.8…sounds about right, I suppose. I knew it wasn’t wonderful. It's not easy getting these things off these days, you know. Arthritis, you see. Here we go… careful now… Oh, and be warned, it’s not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore. It's on the bottom of your heel, as you said. There is some redness around it, and a little bit of drainage. It doesn’t appear to be deeply infected at this point, but it definitely needs attention. It is tender to the touch, and there's some warmth around the area. Your pulses are present, thankfully, which is good. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Well, I’m glad to hear the pulses are good. That sounds…positive, doesn’t it? It’s a relief to know something is working properly for a change. So, what does all this mean? Is it serious? And what are you going to do about it? I really don’t want to lose my foot, you know. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington, and losing your foot is certainly not what we want. This sore is concerning because of your diabetes. Diabetes can affect blood flow and healing, making even small wounds slow to heal and prone to infection. At this point, it doesn’t appear to be a deep infection, but we need to prevent it from getting worse. Based on what I see and your history, it seems like you have a diabetic foot ulcer. We’ll need to take several steps to manage it. First, we need to offload pressure from the area. That means avoiding walking on it as much as possible. We may need to get you a special shoe or boot. Second, we need to keep it clean and covered. Third, we need to control your blood sugar. Finally, we’ll need to monitor it closely for any signs of infection. I'm going to order some blood work to check your infection markers and your overall health. I will also get a referral for wound care. They specialize in these types of ulcers and can provide more specialized treatment. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds…a lot. Offload pressure, special shoes, wound care… I suppose it's better to do something than nothing. My blood sugar…yes, I suppose getting that under control is a good idea. I’ll try. I really will. Wound care…will they be able to…fix it? And how often will I have to go? I don’t drive anymore, you see. My daughter usually takes me to appointments, but she’s very busy. And will this be expensive? I’m on Medicare, of course, but…
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Ms. Cannington. Wound care specialists are experts in healing these types of ulcers. They will clean the wound, apply special dressings to promote healing, and monitor it closely for any signs of infection. They can also provide education on foot care and diabetes management. As for how often you'll need to go, that will depend on the severity of the ulcer and how well it's healing. Typically, you'll start with visits 2-3 times a week. As it improves, we can reduce the frequency. We’ll work with your daughter’s schedule as much as possible. Regarding costs, Medicare typically covers 80% of wound care services, and you'll be responsible for the remaining 20% co-pay. We have a billing department that can help you understand your out-of-pocket expenses. I’m going to write orders for the blood work and the referral to wound care. I will also give you a prescription for special diabetic socks and instructions on proper foot care. It is important that you follow these instructions carefully. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Diabetic socks, you say? That sounds…sensible, I suppose. Although, I have so many socks already. Oh well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Well… I suppose my biggest concern is…will it work? Will I be able to walk again without pain? I don’t want to end up stuck in a chair for the rest of my life. That's what I really fear. And…will it get infected? I hear such terrible stories about infections…
DOCTOR: Those are completely understandable fears, Ms. Cannington. It’s good you're voicing them. Whether it will “work” – meaning full recovery and pain-free walking – is difficult to guarantee, as every patient is different. However, with diligent wound care, blood sugar control, and following the instructions carefully, we can significantly improve your chances of healing and regaining your mobility. Regarding infection, that’s why close monitoring is so important. The wound care team will be watching for any signs – increased redness, swelling, pain, drainage, fever – and will treat it immediately if an infection develops. We’ll also educate you on how to recognize these signs yourself. It’s important to remember that we're a team in this. We’ll work together to manage your condition and prevent complications. I’m optimistic that we can achieve a positive outcome. I'm going to print out the orders for the blood work and the referral to wound care, as well as the foot care instructions. Please call the wound care office to schedule your first appointment. Do you have any questions about these documents, or anything else before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Small print! I’ll need my daughter to read these over for me. Well…I suppose there’s nothing else for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s…a lot to take in. I’ll call the wound care office as soon as my daughter has a chance to look over these papers. I hope… I really hope this works.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cannington. It is a lot, and you’re right to take your time and have your daughter review everything. We’ll do everything we can to help you. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at any time. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again for your follow-up appointment. .
