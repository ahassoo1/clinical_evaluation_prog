DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don't usually do doctors, but the military… they want this exam thing before I can even think about signing up. Seems silly, but gotta do what ya gotta do, right? It's for… well, everything. Making sure I'm not falling apart, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-enlistment physical. Totally makes sense. They want to get a baseline and make sure everything’s in good working order. No worries at all. “Everything” is a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Going on? Not much goes on with me. I work. I fix things. Machines mostly. Big ones, small ones. Doesn't matter. I keep 'em running. Been doin' it for… well, a long time. I feel alright. Always have. Strong as an ox, if you ask me. What exactly are you lookin' for? It feels like a waste of time, honestly. I can lift more than most fellas half my age.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, and it's great you stay so active! We're not necessarily looking for anything wrong, but the military has specific requirements, and we want to make sure we cover all the bases. It's a pretty thorough exam, and sometimes things show up that people don't even realize are affecting them. Okay, let's start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah. Not really. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, after a long day bending over engines. But that's just… old age, I reckon. Everyone gets that. Not the kinda pain that stops ya from doin' things, you know? It's just… there. A little twinge. Nothing to worry about. I used to wrestle, you know. Took a few hits. Probably just that. Old injuries.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Wrestling can definitely take a toll. And you’re right, some aches and pains are just part of life. Just to be thorough, can you describe where exactly the pain is in your back?
PATIENT: Right in the lower part. Sort of… across the small of my back. It's not constant. Comes and goes. Like I said, after I've been workin' on somethin' low to the ground all day. Bendin' and twistin'. Mostly just feels stiff. I can usually work right through it. I don't sit around feelin' sorry for myself. Not my style. It’s not like it shoots down my leg or anything. Just… achey.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back ache, worse with bending and twisting, no radiating pain. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Layin' flat. That usually does the trick. Just… restin' on my back. Or if I stretch a bit. Not those fancy yoga stretches, mind ya. Just… pullin' on it a little. And workin' through it. Keep movin', you know? Can’t just sit still. Makes it worse if I do. Really, it’s not a big deal. I’ve had it for years. I figured it was just… my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting and gentle stretching help, and staying active is better than being still. That gives me a good idea of what's going on. Now, let's move on from the back for a moment. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? No. Not at all. I don't get sick. Rarely even catch a cold. Always been healthy. Strong immune system, I suppose. I work with grease and oil and all sorts of things all day, and I haven’t been laid up sick in… well, I can't even remember the last time. Night sweats? No, definitely not. What kinda question is that, anyway? Sounds like somethin' serious. I thought this was just a quick check-up.
DOCTOR: It is mostly a quick check-up, but we have to ask a lot of questions to be thorough. Those questions are just routine, to rule out anything serious. Okay, good. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Have you noticed any recent weight loss or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds. Workin' all day builds up an appetite, ya know? I eat plenty. Good, solid food. Meat and potatoes. Not one of those fancy diet fellas. Appetite’s always been good. Never had a problem eatin’. Don’t skip meals. Need the fuel for work, ya know? Makes sense. What are you gettin' at? Is somethin' wrong? I told ya, I'm healthy.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize if I'm making you feel like something is wrong. We're just covering all the bases. No recent weight loss, good appetite – that’s good. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control recently?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Now you're askin' personal questions. I don't see what that's got to do with joinin' the military. I’m here to make sure I'm strong enough to lift things and not break, not to talk about… that. Seriously. That’s a bit much, don’t you think? This is gettin' ridiculous. Is this standard procedure? I'm startin' to feel uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, and I sincerely apologize. That was insensitive of me to ask without explaining why, and I completely understand your discomfort. These questions are part of a comprehensive health assessment, and they help us identify potential issues that might affect your ability to serve. It’s important to rule out anything that could be a concern, even if it seems unrelated. I should have explained that upfront. We're not trying to pry, just be thorough. Would you prefer I skip those questions?
PATIENT: Yeah. Skip 'em. Just… skip 'em. I'm not comfortable talkin' about any of that. Honestly, this whole thing is feelin' like a waste of time. I'm a strong, healthy man. I can lift heavy things, I don't get sick, and I can pass any physical test you throw at me. These personal questions aren’t gonna change that. Just tell me when you're done askin' questions and we can get on with it. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I respect your boundaries completely, and we can definitely move forward without discussing those topics. I apologize again for making you uncomfortable. Let's talk about any past medical history you might have. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not a single thing. Always been healthy as a horse. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up fine. Other than that, nothin'. No asthma, no high blood pressure, no diabetes. I don't even take vitamins, honestly. Just… healthy. My family is all the same. Long livin', strong folk. Never had much trouble with sickness. Is that good enough? Can we just… move on? I'm startin' to lose patience. This is a real waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s excellent to hear. Negative past medical history and a family history of good health are both very positive. And you are right to expect efficiency, I apologize for the delay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not a single one. Like I said, I don't get sick, I don't break things, and I certainly don't end up in hospitals. Not my style. I fix things, I don't need fixin'. Hospitals are for… well, people who are sick. And I'm not sick. Really, I’m startin' to wonder why I even bothered comin' in here. This is just confirm what I already know, isn't it? I'm healthy. Can we please get to the physical part now? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. It sounds like you're in excellent health, and we’re just covering all the bases to be absolutely certain. No surgeries or hospitalizations – that’s great. Okay, let’s move on to the physical exam then. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Finally. Yeah, fine. Just get on with it. I got nothin' to hide. Just do what you gotta do. And try to be quick about it, alright? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That's within a normal range. Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Nose looks clear, throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything so far looks good, Delron. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and strength. Can you extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Go ahead. I could probably lift a small car with these arms. Not braggin', just statin' a fact.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes there, nice and strong. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. How’s that? Pretty strong, right? I work with machines all day. Gotta have a good grip.
DOCTOR: Very strong grip, yes. Excellent. Now, can you push against my hands with your feet like you’re trying to push me away?
PATIENT: Like this? I could probably kick down a door with these legs. No problem. I used to wrestle, remember? Gotta have strong legs for that. I'm not weak, Doc.
DOCTOR: Yes, excellent. Very strong legs. Now, I’d like to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: There. Easy. See? Flexible. Still got it. Not bad for an old guy, eh? I keep myself in shape. Gotta be able to get into tight spaces to fix things. No creaky joints or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Yes, good range of motion, very flexible. And you’re right, you’re in excellent shape. Alright, let’s finish up with a quick neurological exam. I’m going to shine a light in your eyes to check your pupils, and then I’ll ask you a few simple questions. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Get it over with. I'm startin' to get impatient again. Just tell me when I'm done. I got work to do, remember? I can't be wastin' all day here.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Good. Now, can you tell me your name?
PATIENT: Delron Hartness. Like it says on the form. What kinda question is that? Are you testin' my memory now? I remember perfectly well. I told you my name when I walked in here.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Delron. And yes, you told me your name earlier. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: 2025. August 2nd. I pay attention to dates. Gotta keep track of things, ya know? Bills, work schedules… important stuff. It’s not like I’m losin’ my marbles or somethin’. What are you gettin’ at? This is gettin’ ridiculous. Are you tryin’ to find somethin’ wrong with me?
DOCTOR: No, Delron, absolutely not. I'm just completing a standard neurological exam, to make sure everything is functioning as it should. It’s a routine part of the physical. You’re doing great. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your recent memory. Do you remember three words I’m going to say?
PATIENT: Fine. Say your words. But if they're somethin' complicated, I'm warnin' ya now, I might not remember 'em. I don't bother with fancy words, just plain speakin'. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those, and I'll ask you to repeat them back to me in a few minutes. Now, let’s go back to the physical. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs one more time… Everything still sounds good. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs are clear. Okay, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Finally. Done. So, what's the verdict? Am I fit enough to join the military or not? Don't tell me I gotta come back for more tests. I haven’t got time for this. Just tell me straight. I'm strong, I'm healthy, and I've got no problems. What do you need to know before you give me the okay? Just get on with it. I'm wastin' daylight here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delron. Based on the physical exam and your reported medical history, you appear to be in excellent physical condition. Your heart and lungs sound strong, your reflexes are good, and you have full range of motion. You demonstrated good strength and neurological function. However, you refused to answer questions about your recent memory and did not participate in the memory recall portion of the exam. Additionally, your weight is significantly below the recommended range for your height. To proceed with the enlistment process, I recommend the following: 1. Weight Gain: You need to gain weight to meet the military's standards. I can provide you with resources on healthy weight gain strategies. 2. Memory Evaluation: A complete evaluation by a neurologist is recommended to assess your recent memory, given your refusal to participate in the initial assessment. I will document these findings and provide you with a written report. Ultimately, the final decision regarding your eligibility will be made by the military recruitment office. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Weight? What weight? I'm plenty strong. Stronger than most fellas twice my size. And memory? What are ya talkin' about? I remember everything just fine. I told you that three words, apple, table, penny, yeah. I remember 'em perfectly. This is ridiculous. I’m not gettin’ weighed or poked and prodded by some fancy doctor just to prove I'm okay. I'm not doin' any of that. It’s a waste of time and money. I'm perfectly fit, and if the military doesn't see that, then that’s their problem. I'm not jumpin' through hoops for anyone. Just give me the report, and I’ll take it to the recruitment office myself. They’ll see I’m good to go. I’m done here. And frankly, I think this whole thing has been a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Delron. I understand your frustration. I will prepare the report documenting the findings of the exam, including your refusal to participate in the memory assessment and your weight. Please be aware that the military recruitment office will likely require these assessments before considering your application. Here’s my contact information if you change your mind. I wish you the best of luck with your application. .
