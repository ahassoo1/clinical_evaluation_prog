DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… wanted to check things out, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before, but figured it couldn’t hurt. Just…curious, I guess. Been feelin’ okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Heindel. We’re here to be precise. Could you elaborate on that “mostly”?
PATIENT: Right, right. Sorry. Uh… well, sometimes my knees kinda ache. Not all the time, just… after work, mostly. And I get tired quicker than I used to, I think. It’s hard to say, bein’ on the boats and all. Lots of liftin’ and movin’. It’s nothin’ bad, I don’t think. Just…old. I’m gettin’ old, I guess. Twenty-five is old, right?
DOCTOR: Twenty-five is… not what one would consider “old,” Mr. Heindel. However, your description is still vague. When you say “ache”, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It's like… a dull throb, mostly. Not sharp, not like I hurt myself hurt. It’s deep down, in the joint, I guess. And it gets worse if I bend ‘em too much. Like, gettin’ down on the deck to fix stuff. It’s… hard to explain. It just feels… worn out. Does that make any sense? It’s not somethin’ I complain about usually. Just… thought I’d mention it.
DOCTOR: “Worn out” is still not a medical term, Mr. Heindel. Alright. And this occurs specifically after physical labor?
PATIENT: Yep. Pretty much. Like, a long day of liftin’ and movin’ stuff on the ship. Or if I’m climbin’ around the rigging. It doesn’t bother me when I’m restin’. I wake up feelin' alright, usually. It just gets worse as the day goes on. And it’s both knees, kinda. Not always the same amount, but… both. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It’s like… I just get tired quicker than I used to. Used to be able to work all day and still have energy to… well, do stuff. Now, I just feel… drained, by the end of the day. Gotta sit down more, you know? And I sleep okay, I think. Maybe not as good as I used to, but I don’t wake up feelin’ like I haven’t slept at all. Just… not as refreshed. It’s kinda hard to explain, feelin’ tired. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: "Not as refreshed" is… insufficient. Let’s move on to some basics. Any past medical history?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin’ out of a tree. But that healed up fine. Had the usual childhood sicknesses, I guess. Chickenpox, stuff like that. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. Never had anythin’ chronic, or… long-term. I eat okay, I think. Try to, anyways. It’s hard on the boats. Never been a smoker, never done any drugs. Just… the usual stuff.
DOCTOR: Any surgical history?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Like I said, broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. Never been cut open or anything like that. Is that…good?
DOCTOR: Alright. And family history?
PATIENT: Uh… my mom, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And her dad, my grandpa, he had… diabetes. But that’s about all I know, really. We don’t… talk about it much. She’s okay now, mostly. And I didn't know my dad very well, so… I don’t know anything about his side of the family. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, take most medicines… never had any problems. Not even with bug bites. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I haven't ever really needed an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Just…plain old me. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I mean, I’ve taken ibuprofen for headaches sometimes, but that's about it. And not regularly, just when my head really hurts. No vitamins, no nothin’. Just…nothin’. Is that…weird?
DOCTOR: No, it’s…uncommon. Alright, Mr. Heindel, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We will start with assessing your knees.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to palpate your knees, feeling for tenderness or swelling. Please tell me if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. Right… there. Not sharp, but… yeah, that’s a little sore. It’s kinda deep down. Not on the surface, but… inside the joint, I think. Is that what you’re lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: And what about here on the right side?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s a little sore there too, but not as bad as the left. It’s… duller, more spread out. It doesn't feel like one specific spot, just… generally achy. Like it’s been rubbed the wrong way, maybe? Is that makin’ sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It kinda clicks a little bit. Not painful, just… feels a little tight. I can’t bend ‘em all the way, like I used to. It feels… restricted, maybe? Is that okay? Feels a little weird, but not hurtin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. I also note some crepitus - that’s the clicking sound you described - in both knees. There’s minimal to moderate swelling, and your reflexes appear normal. Based on this preliminary examination, it appears you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis. However, further imaging will be needed to confirm this diagnosis.
PATIENT: Osteo…what-now? That sounds…bad. Is that like… my knees are gettin’ old? What kinda imaginin’? Like, x-rays? And what does that mean? Can I still…work? Is there medicine for it?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is essentially wear and tear of the cartilage in your joints. It is a common condition, often associated with age and physical activity. And yes, we will need to obtain X-rays of both knees to assess the extent of the cartilage damage. As for your ability to work, that will depend on the severity of the condition, which is why the imaging is crucial. We can explore various treatment options, including physical therapy, pain management medications, and in some cases, injections. However, please understand that there is no “cure” for osteoarthritis. The goal of treatment is to manage your symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. I will order the X-rays now. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… cure? So it just… gets worse? That’s not good. Physical therapy… what’s that involve? Like… exercise? I’m already tired all the time. And injections… are those painful? What if I can’t work? I gotta pay rent. This is kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Mr. Heindel. We haven't even seen the X-rays yet. Physical therapy involves exercises designed to strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. It’s not about strenuous activity, but rather targeted movements to support your joints. As for the injections, there is some discomfort involved, but it is typically mild and temporary. They can provide significant pain relief, but they are not a long-term solution. And regarding your ability to work, we will assess your condition and explore all available options. If you are unable to continue your current job, we can discuss potential disability benefits. But let's focus on obtaining the X-rays first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… X-rays first. Yeah, I understand. Where do I go for those? Is it… here? And how long will it take to get the results? I just…I gotta know if I can still work. That’s the biggest thing. And… is there anything I can do now? Like, while I’m waiting for the results? Just to…make it a little easier?
DOCTOR: Alright. The X-rays will be done here, in the radiology department. The receptionist will schedule you for an appointment immediately after this consultation. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your knee pain. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. However, please remember that these are only temporary measures. A definitive diagnosis and treatment plan will require the X-ray results. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… ibuprofen, avoid strain, wait for the X-rays. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go talk to the receptionist now? Is there anything else I need to do before I go?
