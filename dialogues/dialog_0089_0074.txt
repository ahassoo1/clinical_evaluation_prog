DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet ya. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s why I’m here. My regular doctor told me to come see someone…said I needed to get it checked out proper.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good of him to suggest that. “Actin’ up” can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me a little more specifically what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Lord, it’s hard to say exactly. Mostly just feelin’…off. Kinda tired a lot, even after a good night’s sleep. And sometimes I get a headache, right in the back of my neck. Not awful, but enough to bother me. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin’ me I should be more careful with the salt in my bakin’, but…well, a biscuit just ain’t a biscuit without it, ya know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand about the biscuits! It’s good you’ve noticed the tiredness and headaches, though. And your daughter is right to be mindful of salt intake; it can definitely affect blood pressure. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were when your regular doctor mentioned you needed to get it checked?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, I don’t. He just said it was high. I ain't one for rememberin’ numbers, never have been. He wrote somethin’ down, but I left it at home on the kitchen table, I reckon. Old age, ya know? Things slip your mind. I just know he looked worried, and he said I should get it looked at soon.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. No need to worry about the exact numbers. We’ll get a reading here today, and that’s what matters. Now, besides the tiredness and headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets kinda blurry, but that happens every now and then anyway, so I didn't pay much mind to it. And my feet… they swell up a bit at the end of the day, especially if I’ve been standin’ for a long time bakin’. Is that somethin’ to worry about? I been wearin’ comfy shoes, but still.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and swelling in your feet are both good things to mention. Do the feet swell both at the same time, or is it just one?
PATIENT: Usually both, Doctor. Not terribly bad, mind ya. Just… puffy. Like I said, I try to keep movin’ and wear good shoes, but bakin’ all day is hard on a body. I'm a big girl, ya know. It's hard to be light on your feet when you make a livin' makin' things heavy.
DOCTOR: You are very self-aware, Ms. Steines, and that’s wonderful. Alright, both feet swelling at the end of the day…that’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: No chest pain, thankfully. And I get a little winded sometimes, but I figured that was just my age catchin’ up to me. I don’t go climbin’ mountains, if that’s what you mean. Mostly just gettin’ up and down from bendin’ over the oven. But it ain’t a sharp pain, or nothin’ scary like that. Just…out of breath easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp chest pain, just getting winded easily. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothin’ serious. My mama always said a good diet and hard work kept a body healthy, and I reckon she was right. Oh, wait… I did have my gallbladder taken out years ago. Maybe… thirty years ago? It don’t bother me none now.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, that’s good to know. And no other diagnoses. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, you know, to keep the joints from gettin’ too stiff. It's a prescription, but I can't recall the name of it right off hand. My daughter handles most of that now, refillin’ the prescriptions and makin’ sure I take ‘em. I just know it’s a little white pill. And sometimes I take somethin’ for a headache, if it gets real bad, but that’s just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for arthritis and over-the-counter headache relief. We’ll get the name of the arthritis medication from your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and never had a problem. I've been around pollen my whole life too, livin’ out here in the country. Never had a reaction, not once. I'm a pretty simple woman, Doctor. Don't take much to bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family. Has anyone in your family had high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well now… that’s a good question. My mama, she had high blood pressure towards the end of her life. And my daddy, he had a weak heart. He didn’t take care of himself like he should have, always smokin’ and eatin’ rich foods. My brother, he has diabetes. He’s doin’ alright, but he has to watch what he eats real careful. So, yeah… a little bit of everything, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lord no. Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. And smokin’? Heavens to Betsy. My daddy smoked enough for all of us. And I ain’t one for messin’ with any of those other things. Just a simple woman, remember? I get my relaxation from bakin’ and spendin’ time with my grandkids. That's enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Steines. Thank you for being so open with me. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Get it over with, then. I got biscuits to bake! The sooner I know what’s goin’ on, the sooner I can get back to my kitchen.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a little…irregular, and there’s a slight wheeze in your lungs. Not alarming, but something we need to investigate. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is quite elevated, 168 over 92. That confirms what your doctor suspected. Now I'm going to check your pulse. Your pulse is also a bit fast, 88 beats per minute. Let's take a look at your feet. There's some swelling in both of your feet, as you mentioned. Skin looks normal. And I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, let's talk about what might be going on. It sounds like you may have hypertension, or high blood pressure. And the fast heart rate and wheezing in your lungs are also something we need to address. It's possible the high blood pressure is contributing to the heart rate and breathing issues. However, we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh Lord… that’s a lot of tests! Sounds serious. But… if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust ya. I just want to feel better, ya know? So, whatever you need to do, just let me know. But… will these tests take long? And will they hurt? I’m a bit of a scaredy cat when it comes to needles.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of tests, I know, but it’s better to be thorough, Ms. Steines. And don’t worry, none of them should hurt much at all. The blood draw will be a small pinch, just like getting a flu shot. And the EKG and chest X-ray are completely painless. The blood draw will take just a few minutes, and the EKG and X-ray will be even quicker. We can get all the tests done here in the clinic today. The results usually come back within a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to try to reduce your stress levels as much as possible. And I know you love your bakin’, but for now, I recommend cutting back on the salt. It will help lower your blood pressure. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Less salt... that's gonna be the hardest part, Doctor. But… alright. I reckon I can try. My daughter will be happy to hear me say that, she’s been naggin’ me about it for years. And I’ll try to relax more, though that ain’t easy neither. Too many things to worry about. So, you’re gonna take some blood, do somethin’ with my heart, and take a picture of my chest? Is that right? And how long will all this take, roughly? I got a batch of cookies that need bakin’ this afternoon…if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Blood draw, EKG, and chest X-ray. We’ll get you all set up. The whole process should take about an hour, maybe a little longer. We can start with the blood draw, then do the EKG, and finish with the chest X-ray. The phlebotomist will come in to take the blood first. The EKG technician will put some stickers on your chest to monitor your heart's activity. And the X-ray technician will take a quick picture of your chest. It's all very simple and non-invasive. We'll have you comfortable in a room, and a nurse will be with you to assist you through the whole process. And don’t worry, you can relax and think about those delicious cookies. Maybe we can even come up with some low-sodium recipes for you after we get the results back. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Low-sodium recipes… now that’s talkin’. Alright, Doctor. You’ve convinced me. Let’s get this over with, then. I reckon I can suffer a little for a good cookie recipe. But… just promise me those stickers for the heart won’t hurt too much, alright? And… is that blood draw gonna be a big needle? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: I promise you, the stickers are very small and won’t hurt at all. They just stick to your chest to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. And the needle for the blood draw is small too – just a little pinch, and it will be over before you know it. I'll make sure the phlebotomist is very gentle. We will get a nurse to stay with you, too. And if you feel uncomfortable at any point, just let me know, and we’ll stop. Your comfort is my priority. Alright, let’s get the nurse started. She’ll come in and get you set up for the blood draw. Then, we'll move on to the EKG and chest X-ray. Nurse Johnson, could you please come in and assist Ms. Steines with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank ya. I’m tryin’ to be brave here, but… old habits die hard, I reckon. And I really do hate needles. Just get it over with quickly, then. And… remind me again about those low-sodium cookie recipes? Gotta have somethin’ to look forward to, ya know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Steines. We’ll definitely find some delicious low-sodium cookie recipes for you. I have a few in mind already – oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip with reduced sugar, maybe even a peanut butter cookie with less salt. We can also look online and find some new ones together. And who knows, maybe we can even invent our own! Here comes Nurse Johnson now. She’s very experienced and gentle. She’ll take good care of you. Just relax, take a deep breath, and remember those delicious cookies. You've got this! Nurse Johnson, this is Ms. Steines. She’s here for a blood draw, EKG, and chest X-ray. She’s a little nervous about the needle, so if you could be extra gentle, I’d appreciate it.
PATIENT: .
