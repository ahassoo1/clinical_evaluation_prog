DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… Alanes, you say? Yes, nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They are… bothering me. A lot. I think. It's hard to remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinuses. I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly when things started, don't worry about that. “Bothering you” – can you describe that a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Yes. Hmm… It feels… full. Like pressure. Behind my eyes, mostly. And… sometimes my face hurts. Like… when you have a bad cold, maybe? But I don't feel cold. It's just… achey. I hope that makes sense. I am sorry, it is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Boham. Pressure behind the eyes and facial aching… that does sound like sinus involvement. And it's perfectly alright to take your time describing it. Now, is this pressure and aching constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. More often now, though. It used to be just when the weather changed, maybe. But now… it's almost every day. Some days it's worse than others. When I lay down, it feels… heavier. Is that… right? I do not know if that is important.
DOCTOR: That is important, Ms. Boham. The fact that it’s more frequent and worse when you lie down is helpful information. It suggests there may be some fluid build-up. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I… sometimes my nose feels stuffy. Not always, but when the pressure is bad, yes. And… I think I cough a little, but I cough always, you know? Because of the… the work. The dust. Is that cough different? I don’t know. It is hard to tell. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Boham. It's very common to have overlapping symptoms, especially with your work environment. So, you have some nasal congestion along with the pressure and aching, and a cough that you've had for a while but might be worse with the sinus symptoms. Is there any discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Yes. Sometimes. It is… clear, mostly. But when it is bad… it can be a little… yellow. Not a lot, though. Just when I blow my nose. And I have to blow it a lot. Is that… normal? I worry about… everything, I think. It’s silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to be concerned, Ms. Boham. Clear or yellow nasal discharge is common with sinus issues. The yellow color can indicate some infection, but doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. Now, have you had a fever, or chills, or any recent loss of taste or smell?
PATIENT: No. No fever. Not that I know of. And no chills. My taste… I eat. I don't think I have lost my taste. And smell… well, the work. Everything smells like dust. I do not know if that is normal anymore. It's been… a long time. I don't think I have lost my smell, though. No.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No fever, chills, or change in taste or smell. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies, asthma, or chronic sinusitis?
PATIENT: Hmm. I don't think so. I… I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. Not since… my husband and I moved here. No, I don't think I have allergies. I get… itchy sometimes, but everyone gets itchy, right? And asthma… no, I don't have trouble breathing. Usually. It's just… the dust at work. And… chronic… what did you say? I am sorry, I forget everything.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Boham. "Chronic sinusitis" means a long-term inflammation of the sinuses. It sounds like you haven't been diagnosed with that, and that's perfectly alright. Now, have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No… No surgeries. Not that I remember. And… serious illnesses… I get sick sometimes, like everyone does. A cold, the flu… But nothing… big. Nothing that needed a doctor. My husband… he takes care of me when I am sick. He makes me tea. That’s good enough. I don't think I have had anything serious. No.
DOCTOR: Okay. No surgeries or serious illnesses. And you’ve mentioned your husband cares for you when you're unwell. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No… no medications. I do not like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. Sometimes my husband gives me… something for the pain, when it is really bad. But I don’t know what it is. Just… a little white pill. And no vitamins. We eat okay, I think. Mostly beans and rice. And… tortillas. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no regular medications, just an occasional pain reliever—a small white pill—that your husband gives you. We’ll try to identify that later if possible. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat a lot of different things. My husband cooks. He tries new recipes. I… I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. Not ever. I think. It’s hard to remember everything. I try not to worry about it, you know? Everything is… stressful enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I work with the drills. For the oil. It is… loud. And dusty. Very dusty. I have been doing it for… a long time. It is hard work. And… I have to wear a mask, but it doesn’t always help. The dust gets… everywhere. It is… I don’t know. I just do what I have to do. My husband, he works too. We need the money.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your work is physically demanding and exposes you to a lot of dust. That is important information. Finally, do you smoke, or drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband doesn't either. We don’t do any of those things. It’s… not good for you. My mother always said. No. We drink water. And sometimes… juice. That’s all. We try to stay healthy. It's hard with the work, but we try.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Boham. That’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, look in your ears and throat, and gently feel your sinuses to see if there’s any tenderness. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… okay. I trust you, Doctor. My husband always says… a good doctor is important. Yes. Please. I hope you can help me. The pressure… it gets worse at night.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Let's take a look. Please have a seat and lean forward slightly. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs, both front and back. Take deep, slow breaths when I tell you. Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale… good. And again… deep breath… and exhale… Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. No wheezing or crackling that would indicate asthma or pneumonia. Now, let's check your ears. Your ear canals look clear, no signs of infection. Now I’m going to gently palpate your sinuses - your forehead and cheeks - to check for tenderness. Okay… and here… any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch… yes. Here… on my forehead… it hurts. And… a little here… on my right cheek. Not too bad, but… yes. It feels… tight. Like a pressure. Is that… bad? I am sorry, I don’t like being touched. It makes me… nervous.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Boham. It’s perfectly understandable to feel nervous. I apologize if the palpation was uncomfortable. The tenderness you're feeling in your forehead and right cheek does suggest inflammation of the sinuses. It aligns with your description of the pressure and pain. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing sinusitis, likely due to your occupational exposure to dust. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it's the most probable cause. Now, given your history and symptoms, I'd like to order a simple X-ray of your sinuses to get a better look at the inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An… X-ray? Yes. If you think it will help. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I… I don't have much money, though. Can I afford it? It is okay if I cannot. I just want the pressure to stop. It keeps me awake at night. My husband… he worries about me.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Ms. Boham. We'll definitely see what we can do. The clinic does have a financial assistance program for patients who are uninsured, and we’ll explore that option for you. The X-ray itself is relatively inexpensive, but we'll discuss the costs upfront and make sure it's manageable. Okay, it looks like the X-ray will cost approximately $150. We can also explore options with the local hospital. Let me see if I can get a referral for reduced-cost imaging. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a nasal saline rinse to help clear out some of the congestion and a mild pain reliever - acetaminophen - that you can take as needed for the discomfort. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Acetaminophen… I think my husband gives me that sometimes. The little white pill. And the… nasal rinse? Is that… easy to do? I don't want to make a mess. I am not very good with… things. And $150… is a lot. But if it will help… I will try. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. Acetaminophen is a good start, and it's good to know your husband already gives you that. As for the nasal rinse, it's quite simple! It's essentially just flushing your nasal passages with saltwater. We can provide you with a squeeze bottle and detailed instructions, and I can show you how to do it properly before you leave. There are also videos online if that helps. I'm also going to write a note for your husband explaining the symptoms to watch out for—like high fever, severe headache, or vision changes—that would warrant a trip to the emergency room. I’ll also give you a referral to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist - an ENT - if the symptoms don't improve with the saline rinse and acetaminophen. Given your occupation, it’s important to have someone who specializes in respiratory health involved. Would you be open to that referral?
PATIENT: An ENT? Yes. If you think it is important. I do not want it to get worse. My husband… he worries about my lungs. He says the dust will… ruin them. Is that… true? And… thank you for writing a note. My husband… he forgets things. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. And the saline rinse… I will try. I hope I can do it.
DOCTOR: Your husband is right to be concerned about the dust. Prolonged exposure can certainly irritate the lungs and lead to chronic respiratory issues. That's why seeing an ENT is a good preventative measure. They can assess the long-term effects of your occupation and recommend strategies to protect your lungs, such as a higher-grade mask or even a change in occupation if necessary. Here's the prescription for the acetaminophen, and this is the referral to Dr. Ramirez, the ENT specialist. Their office is located about an hour from here, and they accept patients with limited insurance. I’ve also included detailed instructions for the nasal rinse. To summarize, we're starting with the acetaminophen, nasal saline rinses, and monitoring your symptoms. If things don't improve within a week, or if you develop any new or worsening symptoms, please contact the office immediately. And, of course, the ENT referral is available if you'd like to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think… that is everything. You explained everything very well, Doctor. And… thank you again. For being so kind. And for not laughing at me when I forget things. And for the note for my husband. He will be very happy. I… I hope the acetaminophen works. And the saline rinse. I will try my best. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to everyone. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. And I sincerely hope the acetaminophen and saline rinse provide some relief. Take care, Ms. Boham, and please tell your husband hello. Have a good day.
