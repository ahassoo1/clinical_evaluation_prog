DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s really starting to get to me. It’s hard to concentrate, you know?
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… tinnitus, technically. And how long exactly is “a bit now,” Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Um… maybe a month? A month and a half, something like that. It started kinda quiet, just after a really loud wedding I was working at. I’m a waiter, so lots of music, lots of people… you know how it is. It’s gotten louder since then, though. Definitely harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Weddings. Right. And has the ringing been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yeah. It’s usually quietest when I’m trying to sleep, which is good, I guess. But when I'm busy, or if there's a lot of noise around, it gets really bad. Like, hard to hear people talking even when they’re right next to me bad. It's just… annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: Annoying isn't a medical term, Mr. Dhanoa. Can you describe the ringing itself?
PATIENT: Sorry, Doctor. Just trying to explain. It’s… a high-pitched whine, mostly. Sometimes it’s like a buzzing. Not a really loud buzz, but… present. And it feels like it’s inside my head, you know? Not like something outside making noise. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Somewhat. And have you noticed any dizziness, hearing loss, or pain in either ear?
PATIENT: No dizziness, thankfully. And no pain, either. My hearing… I think it’s a little bit worse, maybe? But it’s hard to tell. I mean, I work at a loud place, so I’m usually around noise anyway. It’s hard to tell if it’s gotten worse, or if I’m just used to the noise. Sorry, I'm probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate. Do you have a history of ear infections, or has anyone in your family had hearing problems?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a kid, yeah, a couple. Nothing major, just the usual stuff. And… my grandfather on my mum’s side, he was pretty deaf when he got old. But I don’t know why, you know? Just… old age, I guess. He never went to the doctor much. Fiji isn't really set up like it is here. I'm divorced, so it’s hard to ask my ex-wife about family history either. Sorry. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It's…information. Alright. Let’s do a quick exam. I’ll need to look in your ears and do a basic hearing test. Please sit up straight and let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Your ear canals are clear. Normal tympanic membranes. Now, I'm going to do a quick Weber and Rinne test. Okay. Those are… borderline. I’m going to run a formal audiometry.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Sounds good. I just want it to stop, you know? This ringing is driving me crazy. Is the audiometry… painful? Or uncomfortable? I'm a bit nervous now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not painful, Mr. Dhanoa. You'll be wearing headphones, and I'll play some tones at different pitches and volumes. Just indicate when you can hear them. It’s simply a measure of your hearing sensitivity. Try to relax. …Alright. And now the left ear.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I’m trying to relax. It’s just… hard when I’m thinking about the ringing the whole time. I can hear that one… and that one… but that one’s really faint. Is that what you want to know? How faint it is?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Dhanoa, that is precisely what I want to know. The results show mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, consistent with noise-induced hearing loss. It's not surprising, given your occupation. Now, about the tinnitus itself… it's likely related to the hearing loss. There isn’t a cure, unfortunately. But there are ways to manage it.
PATIENT: Manage it? Like… what ways? I mean, I don’t want to just live with this ringing forever. Is there anything I can do? Some medicine or something? I really need to be able to hear, you know? For work, for everything.
DOCTOR: There are several options. We can discuss hearing aids, which can often mask the tinnitus by amplifying ambient sounds. There are also tinnitus retraining therapy programs, although those require commitment. As for medication… there aren’t any drugs specifically for tinnitus, but sometimes anti-anxiety medications can help manage the associated stress and sleep disturbances. However, the most important thing is prevention. Strict noise protection is crucial. Earplugs or earmuffs at work, avoidance of loud noises whenever possible. And frankly, consider a different line of work if it continues to be a significant problem.
PATIENT: A different line of work? That’s… hard. I’ve been waiting tables for years. It’s all I know. And earplugs… they make it hard to hear the customers. I need to be able to take orders, you know? So… hearing aids? That sounds expensive. And the therapy… how long does that take? I don’t have a lot of time, or money, to be honest. I just want this ringing to stop. Is there anything else? Anything at all? Maybe some drops or something? I’m desperate, Doctor. Honestly, I am. .
DOCTOR: There are no drops, Mr. Dhanoa. As I said, there's no quick fix. I can prescribe a trial of a low-dose anti-anxiety medication, but it's not a long-term solution and may have side effects. I’ll refer you to an audiologist for a full hearing assessment and to discuss hearing aid options and tinnitus retraining therapy. They can provide a more detailed plan and cost estimates. I understand this is frustrating, but it’s crucial to be realistic. Protecting your remaining hearing and learning to manage the tinnitus are your best options. Here is the referral information. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions for me?
