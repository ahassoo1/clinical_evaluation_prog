DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I don't really have time for long chats, so let's just get right to it. I want to get pregnant. I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, I want a baby. And I want it to be easy. I don’t want any… complications. Is that what you do here? Make sure it’s easy?
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly alright to want a straightforward path to pregnancy, and I assure you, we absolutely can discuss how to make that as smooth as possible. I specialize in family medicine, which includes preconception counseling and helping individuals and couples achieve pregnancy. “Easy” isn’t always guaranteed, as there are many factors involved, but we can certainly work together to optimize your chances and address any potential concerns. To start, I’d like to gather some information about your medical history and current health status. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I've already been to doctors. Lots of them. After… everything. And they all asked a million questions. Honestly, I barely remember any of it. I’m… generally healthy, I guess. I eat alright. I try to. And I don’t… smoke or anything. Is that what you need to know? Because if so, yes. Can we just skip the rest? It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to revisit past medical experiences, Carmaleta, and I appreciate you sharing what you’re comfortable with. It's good to know you maintain a healthy lifestyle, and that you don’t smoke. To best assist you, even a basic understanding of your history is important. Perhaps we can take it one step at a time. Just a few key things, if you don't mind. First, do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies... Honestly? Not that I know of. I mean, I've had the usual colds and stuff, but never anything serious. I don’t go around breaking out in hives or anything dramatic. My husband always handled the doctor stuff, you see. He remembered everything. I just… trusted him. So, no. No allergies, as far as I’m aware. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright to feel that way. Okay, no known allergies – that’s good. And what about any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication. The doctor put me on it after… well, never mind. A small dose, though. Nothing fancy. And that’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Makes me feel… weak, you know? Is that enough? Can we talk about what you can do to make this happen now?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Blood pressure medication is important to note, thank you. And I understand your feelings about medication. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me the name and dosage of your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I don't remember. It's a little white pill... maybe pinkish? I just take it every morning. The pharmacy delivers it. Honestly, I don't pay attention to the details. My husband always handled all that! Can't you just look it up? It's got to be in your system somewhere. I have insurance, you know. I'm a patient here!
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Carmaleta. Let me access your medication history through your insurance information. One moment… Okay, I see here you’ve been prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Lisinopril... yeah, that sounds right. Lisinopril. Okay. Finally, something easy. Yes, that's it. Now, can we please talk about getting pregnant? I don’t want to waste any more time on… pills and details. I just want to know what I need to do, and how quickly it can happen.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. You’re absolutely right, let’s focus on your goal of pregnancy. To start, it's helpful to understand your menstrual cycle. Could you tell me about your last menstrual period – when it started and how regular your cycles typically are?
PATIENT: Ugh, menstrual cycles… Honestly, they’re… irregular. They come and go. After my husband passed, everything was just… off. Sometimes they're close together, sometimes they're months apart. It's really hard to keep track. I honestly don't even bother anymore. I just… hope for the best, I guess. It's all very stressful. I really just want to know if there’s something you can do to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. Irregular cycles can certainly add to the stress. That’s perfectly alright. It's very common for cycles to be affected by significant life events, and it's good you're addressing it now. To get a better idea of what's happening, and to assess the best approach, I'd like to order some basic blood work. This will check your hormone levels, thyroid function, and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a guinea pig. Look, I really don’t want to spend all day in labs. Can't you just… give me something to take? A pill, a shot, anything? I don’t need to know why things aren't working, I just want them to work. Is that an option? I have private insurance, I can pay for whatever is fastest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta, and I want to assure you I'm here to help in the most efficient way possible. While I appreciate you wanting a quick solution, starting medication without understanding the underlying cause of your irregular cycles isn't generally recommended. It’s important to rule out any potential issues first. The blood work will give us a clearer picture and allow me to tailor a plan specifically to your needs. It’s a relatively simple procedure, and we can schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes of your time. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Thirty minutes. First thing. But if it doesn't tell you anything useful, I’m not coming back. Honestly, I'm wasting my time here. Just… get it over with. And make sure the results come back quickly. I don’t have time for delays.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Carmaleta. I’ll make sure the lab is aware of your desire for quick results, and we will prioritize getting them back to you as soon as possible. I'll also give you my direct line so you can reach out with any questions or concerns. Okay, let's get you scheduled for the blood work tomorrow morning. And while we wait for the results, I can provide you with some general information about preconception health, including lifestyle factors and things you can do to prepare your body for pregnancy. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Give me the number. And… I guess information is okay, as long as it's not a long pamphlet. Just… the basics. What do I need to do? And tell me again, what time tomorrow? I don’t want to be late. Honestly, I have a lot on my mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. My direct line is 555-123-4567. And here’s a brief overview of some key things you can focus on. It’s mostly about maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough folic acid, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol, and managing stress. Your blood work appointment is scheduled for 8:00 AM tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. They will need your insurance information, and it’s best to arrive 15 minutes early to complete any necessary paperwork. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No. 8 AM. Across the street. Fine. Look, I think that's everything. Honestly, I'm glad we're finally getting something done. Don't waste my time, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. I understand your concerns, and I assure you I will do everything I can to help you achieve your goal. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good evening, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. .
