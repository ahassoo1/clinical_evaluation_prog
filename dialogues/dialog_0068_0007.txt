DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. My back… it is very painful. I would like to be quick, if possible. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Back pain… alright. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It started… oh, let me think. About two weeks ago, I believe. It is a constant ache, mostly in my lower back. Worse when I bend over, or when I lift things, naturally. I work with fences, you see. It’s… physical work.
DOCTOR: Fences, right. Physical work… okay. And is the pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating? Do you mean… does it go anywhere else? Yes, sometimes it feels like it goes down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, but… to my knee, maybe. It is not constant, this part. Just sometimes when the back pain is very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, down the left leg, to the knee… and would you describe the pain as sharp, dull, burning, or something else?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache, mostly. But when it goes down my leg, that is sharp. A quick, sharp pain. Not all the time, like I said. Mostly just the dull ache in my back. It makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dull ache in the lower back, sharp pain radiating down the left leg occasionally… Any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes my left foot feels… a little numb. Not always. More when I have been on it a long time. And… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? Not bad, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness and tingling in the left foot… Have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yes. I have taken some over-the-counter pain relievers. The white pills… ibuprofen, I think. They help a little, but not much. And I try to rest when I can, but… with the work, that is difficult. I also tried a warm bath, that helped for a short time.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, warm bath…Okay. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… old age, I suppose. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I do not take anything for it. My husband… he passed away last year. That has been hard. But nothing else, really. I have Medicare, if that is what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. No major medical history… Just the blood pressure and your husband's passing, I am sorry to hear that. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never had any surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Not even as a child. I am a strong woman, Doctor. I do not get sick easily. Is this taking long? I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Not much longer, Ms. Reihner. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I have taken many things over the years, for colds and such. Never had a reaction. I can’t recall ever being allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies…Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my back hurts. And sometimes, a multivitamin, but not regularly. I forget to take it, mostly. I used to take calcium, but I stopped. It did not seem to help.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your back and legs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. As long as it is quick. I do need to get back to work. What will you be doing? Just so I know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be checking your range of motion, feeling for tenderness, and doing a few simple tests to see how your nerves are functioning in your legs. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything is painful. If you could lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Be gentle, please. My back is very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with range of motion. Can you bend your knees up towards your chest?
PATIENT: That… that hurts a little. Mostly in my back. Not too bad, but… I can feel it. Is this what you need?
DOCTOR: Okay, some discomfort with knee flexion. Now, I’m just going to feel along your spine. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Yes! Right there. That is very tender. It hurts when you press there. A sharp pain. Be careful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Tenderness noted at L4-L5. Now, I’m going to lift your leg straight up in the air. Just let it go limp. Tell me if you feel any pain radiating down your leg. Any pain?
PATIENT: Yes… there. That… that sends a sharp pain down my leg. Like you said, radiating. It is not bad, but I definitely feel it. Stop, please. That is enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, that’s enough. Positive straight leg raise test on the left side. Now, just a few quick checks of your reflexes and muscle strength… Everything seems normal there. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain with possible sciatic nerve irritation. It is a common problem, especially with physical work. We’ll need to get some x-rays to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: X-rays? Will that take long? And… what does this mean? I just need to know if I can go back to work, or not. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: The x-rays will take just a few minutes. We can get them done right here in the clinic. As for whether it’s serious… most lumbar strains heal with conservative treatment – rest, pain relievers, and physical therapy. However, we need the x-rays to rule out a fracture or other more serious problem. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be thorough. I’m going to order the x-rays now. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting and bending for the next few days. And continue taking the ibuprofen as needed. I’ll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, which may help with the pain and spasms. Once we have the results, we can discuss a physical therapy plan. As for going back to work… I recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have the x-ray results and can better assess your condition. It’s better to be safe than to risk making the injury worse. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. I need to know how long I will be out of work. I have bills to pay. And… the muscle relaxant… will that make me sleepy? I need to be able to function. I do not want to be useless.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Reihner. It’s difficult to say exactly how long you’ll be out of work without the x-ray results. However, most people with a lumbar strain can return to work within a few days to a few weeks, with modifications. We’ll tailor the plan to your specific needs and job requirements. As for the muscle relaxant… yes, it can cause some drowsiness, especially initially. However, it’s usually mild and temporary. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. I will also advise you not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking it. I want to emphasize that we’ll work together to get you back to work as quickly and safely as possible. The x-rays will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on, and we can develop a plan from there. I’ll have the technician come in and take the x-rays now. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Just… please be quick. I have things to do. And I hope it is nothing serious. I have never had problems like this before.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Reihner. We’ll be as quick as possible. And I understand your anxiety. Most likely, this is a simple strain that will resolve with treatment. I’ll be right back after the technician takes the x-rays. .
