DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Andraca. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets difficult. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I believe. I don’t want to take up too much of your time, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Maribeth. It’s my job to listen, and I want to understand what’s going on. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. Maybe… six or seven weeks? It's hard to say precisely. It started gradually, just a little harder to get comfortable. Now, it’s quite noticeable. I have to prop myself up with pillows to breathe comfortably when I'm resting. It doesn’t bother me when I’m sitting or standing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So it’s specifically when you lie down that you experience this difficulty breathing. Can you describe what it feels like when you're lying flat?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not exactly painful. It's more… a tightness in my chest. Like something is pressing on me. And I have to take more effort to breathe, you see? It feels like my lungs aren't filling up completely. It's quite unsettling, truthfully. I haven't changed anything in my routine, so I’m a little worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. A tightness in the chest with increased effort to breathe is definitely something we need to investigate. Aside from the breathing difficulty and chest tightness, have you noticed any other symptoms—like coughing, wheezing, swelling in your ankles or feet, or any palpitations or racing of the heart?
PATIENT: Let me think… no coughing, Doctor. And no wheezing that I’m aware of. My ankles… sometimes they feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on my feet. And… palpitations? I don’t believe so. My heart feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I try to be mindful of things like that. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I just want to be certain I haven't overlooked anything.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to be so observant, Maribeth. Puffiness in the ankles is something to keep in mind. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any history of heart problems, like high blood pressure, or irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… yes, I did, many years ago. The doctor put me on medication for it, but I haven’t taken it in quite a while, truthfully. I try to watch my salt intake, and it seemed to be alright for a long time. As for irregular heartbeat… not that I know of. I’ve never been told I had one. And truthfully, I don’t remember ever being sick with anything serious in my life, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, thank you. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… No surgeries, no. And I’ve only been to the hospital once, when I broke my wrist many years ago. A simple fracture, it healed quickly. Otherwise, I’ve been quite fortunate, health-wise. I really haven’t been much trouble to any doctor, until now, it seems. I hope this isn't something too serious.
DOCTOR: No, let's not jump to conclusions. We'll figure this out. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I’ve eaten just about everything over the years, and never had a reaction. I've been careful, naturally. And I don't take any medications regularly, aside from an occasional pain reliever for my arthritis. But that's it. I don't believe I've ever had a bad reaction to anything. Is it necessary to go into detail about the arthritis? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine for now. We can always come back to it if needed. Okay, one last set of questions before we do a quick exam. Could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… my mother had some trouble with her heart later in life. I believe it was… congestive heart failure, yes. And my father… he had diabetes, but he didn’t take very good care of himself, truthfully. His brother also had diabetes. That’s about all I can recall. It wasn't a particularly talkative family when it came to health matters, I’m afraid. I hope this isn't too much information. I'm just trying to be helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Maribeth, thank you. Knowing about your mother's heart condition and your father’s diabetes is important. Okay, now I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your ankles for any swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I understand. Just let me know if there’s anything I should be doing, or if it will be uncomfortable. I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a little bit of an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your breathing sounds a little bit wheezy on both sides, and your heart rate is regular but slightly elevated. There’s some mild swelling in both ankles, and I do notice some pitting when I press. Okay, Maribeth. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in this quick exam, it sounds like we need to investigate further. Your symptoms – the difficulty breathing when lying flat, the chest tightness, and the ankle swelling – could indicate a few possibilities, including congestive heart failure, which you mentioned your mother had. We need to rule that out, as well as consider other possibilities. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to start, and also some bloodwork to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a marker called BNP, which can help us assess for heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. An X-ray, an EKG, and bloodwork. I suppose that's necessary. I do hope it won't be too expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you see. And truthfully, I don't like hospitals much. But if it’s to find out what's wrong, then I’ll do it. When will I know the results? And will I need to come back here to get them? I do have that appointment this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Maribeth. We’ll keep everything as streamlined as possible. The X-ray and EKG can be done here in the clinic today, and the bloodwork can also be drawn here. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I can have the lab fax the results directly to me, and I will call you with the findings as soon as I have them. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We can also see if the lab offers any financial assistance programs, given your fixed income. Regarding your afternoon appointment, I don’t want you to worry about rescheduling if it’s important. Just let them know you’re having some medical tests done, and we'll work around it. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable, Doctor. Fax the results, call me, and discuss them. And I’ll see about financial assistance. Thank you. I do appreciate you being so understanding. It’s a relief to finally be getting something done about it. I’m ready whenever you are to proceed with the tests. I just want to get this sorted out, one way or another. I’ve lived a long life, and I’d like to keep it that way, if you understand. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Maribeth. And you’ve certainly earned the right to want to stay healthy and enjoy your life. No, there’s nothing specific you need to do to prepare for the tests. For the bloodwork, it’s best to be hydrated, so try to drink a glass of water before we draw it. Otherwise, just come as you are. Let me have Nurse Evelyn come in and draw your blood, and then we can get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. She'll explain the process to you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Nurse Evelyn, you say? Very well. I trust her to be gentle. I haven't had my blood drawn in many years. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I’m rather faint, you see. But I’m ready when you are. Let’s get this over with, shall we? Thank you, Doctor Andraca. You've put my mind at ease a little, at least.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Nurse Evelyn is very skilled and will take excellent care of you, Maribeth. She'll explain everything step-by-step. And don’t hesitate to let her know if you’re feeling faint at any point. I’ll be right here, reviewing your chart while Nurse Evelyn gets started. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, Maribeth. Don't worry.
