DOCTOR: Right, Marija Chilla… 44 years old. Look, I’m a busy man, so let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. My husband, he insists I come. He’s been reading things online, you see, about… planning for the future. Rather dramatic, if you ask me. He wants me to fill out some sort of form, an “Advance Directive” or a “POLST” form, he called it. Frankly, I think it’s a bit premature, but he’s quite insistent. I suppose I’m here to inquire about it.
DOCTOR: Online, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, online. Honestly, the things people find these days. He’s always been one for…excessive worrying. It’s probably nothing, but he's convinced I need to document what he calls my "wishes" should…something happen. I haven’t the faintest idea what wishes he’s referring to, frankly. It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Look, these forms… they're for people who are actually sick. You seem perfectly healthy to me. I don't have time to hold your hand through hypothetical scenarios. But, alright. So, your husband wants you to decide what medical treatments you wouldn't want if you were, say, on your deathbed?
PATIENT: “On my deathbed”? Heavens. Well, that’s rather…graphic, isn’t it? I simply want to understand what this involves. He said it would make things easier for him, should…the unthinkable occur. I assure you, I have no intention of being on a “deathbed” any time soon. But if it quiets him…perhaps. What sort of…decisions would I be making, exactly? And how much of my time is this going to take?
DOCTOR: It's about…CPR, ventilation, feeding tubes. Whether you want us to do everything possible to keep you alive, even if it's…uncomfortable. Or if you want us to let nature take its course. It’s a lot of fuss, if you ask me. Look, do you have any serious health problems?
PATIENT: “Let nature take its course”? How… uncivilized. I assure you, I have no “serious health problems.” A touch of indigestion now and then, perhaps, from the spices in my husband’s cooking, but nothing a little peppermint tea can’t fix. Really, this all seems rather morbid and unnecessary. But… if it means explaining to my husband that I’ve considered it… very well. What exactly would be involved in saying I don’t want… all of these things? Would I need a lawyer?
DOCTOR: A lawyer?
PATIENT: Yes, a lawyer. My husband is… thorough. He insists on having everything properly documented, legally binding. He said something about “peace of mind” and “avoiding complications.” Honestly, he treats me as if I'm already…incapacitated. But if this form requires such formality, then so be it. Do you have one readily available, or will this require a lengthy appointment with a solicitor? And, frankly, how long will it take you to explain? I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Look, I’ve got a form here, it’s standard. It’s mostly checkboxes. I'll explain briefly. It asks about CPR—cardiopulmonary resuscitation—if your heart stops. Ventilation—a breathing machine. And artificial nutrition—feeding tube. Check the boxes saying you don’t want them if that’s what you desire. Honestly, it's just paperwork. I can't give legal advice, so I don’t know why your husband is fussing about a lawyer. Does that answer your question?
PATIENT: “Mostly checkboxes”? That’s… mildly reassuring. Though I still find the entire concept rather… unsettling. “Artificial nutrition”? That sounds dreadful. Very well. Perhaps if you simply show me the form, I can indicate my preferences. Quickly, please. I really must be going shortly. And do try to avoid any… graphic descriptions. It's quite enough to think about it at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, here. First box: CPR. Do you want us to attempt to restart your heart if it stops?
PATIENT: “Attempt to restart”? Heavens. What are the… alternatives? Simply… allowing things to run their course? The thought is…rather bleak. But… my husband is insistent on being “prepared.” Very well. No, I do not want my heart… “restarted.” It sounds barbaric. Check that box, please. And perhaps you can explain the next one without… undue detail.
DOCTOR: Next. Ventilation. This is if you can't breathe on your own. Do you want us to put you on a breathing machine?
PATIENT: A “breathing machine”? Goodness, no. The very idea. I have perfectly good lungs, thank you very much. And I certainly do not wish to be…encumbered by tubes and wires. Check that box as well, please. Honestly, this is all rather…degrading. One feels as if one is already…well, never mind. Proceed. Quickly, please. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Last one. Artificial Nutrition. If you can't eat or drink, do you want us to feed you through a tube?
PATIENT: “Feed me through a tube”? Oh, that’s simply…unthinkable! Absolutely not. I take pride in my culinary tastes, thank you very much. The idea of being…sustained by a tube is… appalling. Check that box immediately, please. And then, if you please, tell me this is all finished. I’m quite certain I’ve expressed my preferences with sufficient clarity. My husband will be…relieved.
DOCTOR: There. Done. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll document this in your chart. It’s not a medical emergency, you understand. It’s just paperwork. Hopefully this will satisfy your husband. Do you have any other…hypothetical concerns?
PATIENT: “Hypothetical concerns”? No, thank you. This…paperwork, as you call it, should suffice. Though I confess, I find the entire exercise rather… unnecessary. I simply wished to be… compliant. And to quiet my husband’s anxieties. Please, do not bother documenting anything further. I assure you, my health is perfectly adequate. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Fine, fine. Have a good day. .
