DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Lahn, is it? Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… because someone said I should be. New to the area, you understand. Medicare wants you to have these visits. Honestly, a lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me. I feel perfectly fine. Let's just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. It’s good you’re coming in to establish care, even if it's just to ensure everything is as you say. Medicare does often recommend these check-ups for new residents. We'll keep it as brief as possible while still making sure we cover everything important. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Honestly, I haven’t the faintest. I mean, I wake up, I have my tea, my husband, Arthur, reads the paper… It’s all rather… routine. I don’t feel sick, if that’s what you’re getting at. I suppose my knees ache a bit when it rains. Is that important? Really, I don't see what this has to do with anything. It's just old age, I presume.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. It’s good to hear things are generally routine. And yes, knee pain with weather changes is something we should note, as it could be related to several things, or simply be part of the normal aging process. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Arthur keeps complaining about my elbows when we play cards. Says I poke him. But that’s hardly a medical issue, is it? And sometimes my back feels a little stiff, but again, it’s probably just… getting old. I used to be very active, you know. Travelled all over with Arthur before… before things slowed down. But I don’t recall any serious pain, if that’s what you’re after. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: No, we're almost through the initial questions, Candice. Just a few more to get a complete picture. You mentioned being very active in the past. Are you still able to do most of the things you enjoy?
PATIENT: Well… not as much as I used to. The travel is… less frequent, naturally. And Arthur does most of the heavy lifting these days. I enjoy my garden, when the weather cooperates. But bending and stooping is… problematic. And climbing the ladder to prune the roses? Absolutely not. I leave that to young people. It’s just… sensible, really. I don't want to risk a fall. Honestly, I prefer to supervise now. Is that satisfactory? Do I have to detail every minor inconvenience?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. You don’t need to detail anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing you’ve slowed down a bit and prefer to supervise the gardening is helpful. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Arthur handles all the medical paperwork, you see. I simply go to the appointments. I think the doctor mentioned something about my cholesterol being a bit high, years ago. And I was told to watch my salt intake, but honestly, everything tastes so bland without it! I’ve no idea about anything else. Honestly, I find all this medical talk rather… distressing. Can we perhaps move on? This is all terribly tedious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. We can move on. It's perfectly alright that Arthur handles the paperwork; that’s very common. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Arthur has a whole chart of them, all neatly organized. I take a little white pill every morning, for my… for something. He reminds me, of course. And a pink one at night. And sometimes a yellow one when my joints are bothering me. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea what they are for. He says they’re important. I trust him implicitly, you see. He’s very good with these things. Are you going to quiz me on dosages now? This is becoming rather absurd.
DOCTOR: No, I won't quiz you on dosages, Candice. It’s perfectly alright that Arthur manages the medications; that’s very helpful. We can review the list with him later. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, but she was a very… stubborn woman. Didn’t believe in doctors, you see. My father had… something with his heart, I think. He wasn’t very talkative. And my brother… well, he had a bit of trouble with his weight, if I recall correctly. Honestly, it was all a very long time ago. I don’t really keep track of these things. Is this really necessary? I have a luncheon, you know. A rather important luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. We’ll make do with what we have. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can do a brief physical exam if you’re comfortable, and that will be all for today. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I think I had a bit of a rash once, from some sort of lotion. But honestly, it was years ago, and I’ve no idea what it was. And Arthur always tells me which foods to avoid. I think I'm mildly sensitive to shellfish, but I haven’t had it in ages. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. It’s all rather… bothersome. Can we please move on? I truly must be going. This has taken far too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We can move on. One final question: have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, naturally. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. A very silly incident, really. And I was briefly hospitalized for the flu, many years ago, but it wasn’t serious. Honestly, I’ve been quite fortunate, all things considered. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I really must be going. This has been… exhaustive. I trust you have all the information you need? .
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Candice. This is a good start. It sounds like you've been quite fortunate, and I appreciate you taking the time to come in. Before you go, I would like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, if you’re comfortable with that. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we can discuss a plan for follow-up. Would that be alright?
