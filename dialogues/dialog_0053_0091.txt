DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this… thirst. I does be drinking water all day, and still feel dry. And I hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right.
DOCTOR: Right. Thirst and hunger. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It start… maybe about a month ago? I thought it was just the heat, you know? But it ain't getting better. It worse now than it was in the beginning. I does have to get up in the night for water sometimes, which I never used to do.
DOCTOR: A month, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A month or so. My husband, he sayin' I should come see you, 'cause it ain't normal. He right, of course. I just… I don't like botherin' people. But this really worryin' me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it's good you came in. We'll figure out what's going on. Now, have you noticed any changes in your…bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? You mean… goin' to the toilet? Well… I does go regular, if you know what I mean. Not constipated or anything. Maybe… maybe I goin' a little more often than usual. But not a lot. It nothin' real noticeable, Doctor. I thought it was the water I drinkin', to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm… I don’t really keep track of my weight. I feel… about the same. Maybe a little heavier, but I does enjoy my food, you know? My husband, he does say I look a little… fuller, maybe? But I ain’t weigh myself to be sure. I does feel… tired sometimes, though. More tired than usual. Does that have anything to do with it?
DOCTOR: Tiredness… alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' serious. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older. The doctor years ago, he told me my pressure was a little high, but he give me some pills and it went down. I stop takin' them after a while, though. Felt alright without them. And I had a bad flu last year, but I got over it. Apart from that… nothin' much, Doctor. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat my greens and I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Like I said, I stopped takin' the pills for the pressure a long time now. I don’t really like takin' pills if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies, if you know what I mean. A little ginger tea for my tummy, that sort of thing. Nothin' else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, any family history of…diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… let me think now. My grandmother, on my mother’s side… she was always sick. I remember her always drinkin' a lot of water and feelin' tired. I don't know if it was diabetes, though. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. My mother, she was healthy as a horse. But my uncle, on my father’s side… he lost a foot. I think he had something with the sugar, but I ain’t sure. It was a long time ago. I don’t know the details, Doctor. I just remember it bein’ somethin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What you mean by that, Doctor? I does live a simple life. I stay home mostly, I does cook for my husband, I does garden a little. We don't go out much, we not the party type. I go to church on Sundays. That it, really. It not a very excitin' life, but it's a peaceful one. I try to eat healthy, like I say, but I does enjoy a good bake sometimes. My husband, he loves my bake.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and I'll need to check your feet. Just a standard check-up, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sound good. Whatever you think is best. Just tell me if it going to be uncomfortable. I don’t like pain, you know. My husband will be lookin' for me soon, so if you could be quick, that would be nice. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A little elevated. Feet… good pulses, but some decreased sensation in both feet. Skin is dry. I’m noting some mild swelling in the ankles.
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh dear. I thought it was just the heat. Does that mean somethin' bad, Doctor? My husband, he does worry about my feet. He says I should wear better shoes, but I like my comfortable slippers. Is that what's causin' it? The slippers?
DOCTOR: The slippers likely aren’t helping. But the swelling, combined with the decreased sensation, and your elevated blood pressure… along with your thirst and frequent urination… I want to order a blood test. A fasting blood sugar, A1C, and a basic metabolic panel. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood test? Oh dear. I don’t like needles, Doctor. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. What does that mean, though? What are you lookin’ for? Is it somethin’ serious? My grandmother… was it the sugar, like my uncle? I’m gettin' worried now, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong with me.
DOCTOR: We’re checking for diabetes, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s a condition where your body has trouble regulating sugar in your blood. Your symptoms are… suggestive of it. The blood test will confirm or rule it out. It’s not an emergency, but it's important to get it checked out. We can discuss treatment options if it is diabetes, but right now, we need to get the test results first. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw a small amount of blood. It will be over quickly.
PATIENT: Diabetes… oh dear. So, that’s what you think it is? I always try to eat healthy, though. I don’t understand. Is it somethin' I did? My husband, he always tellin’ me I should walk more. Could that be it? If it is diabetes, is it… curable? Or will I have to be takin' pills for the rest of my life? I don't want to be takin' pills, Doctor. I really don't. What happens if I do have it? What will I have to do?
DOCTOR: Ms. Zicarelli, let’s not jump to conclusions. We haven't even received the test results yet. Lifestyle factors can contribute to diabetes, yes—diet and exercise are important. But there are other factors involved as well. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, it’s manageable. There are several treatment options available—dietary changes, exercise, oral medications, and sometimes, insulin. We would discuss the best course of action after we have the results. And yes, in some cases, medication is necessary long-term. But it's not a death sentence. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes. Let’s get the blood test done first. Then we can talk about this rationally. Do you have any other questions before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that's all for now. Just the blood test. I'm just… worried, you know? My husband will be very upset if I have this… diabetes. He always worryin' about my health. I hope it's nothin' serious. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go to the lab now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician will explain the procedure. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then.
