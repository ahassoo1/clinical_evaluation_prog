DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, yes. Doctor, right? Look, I don’t have all day. My chest… it feels funny. And my heart, it goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, they said it was high. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing a funny sensation in your chest, a fast heartbeat at times, and you've been told your blood pressure is high. We’ll certainly get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this “funny” feeling in your chest?
PATIENT: Funny… like a squeezing. Not bad bad, but… uncomfortable. Like someone is sitting on it. It comes and goes. When I walk uphill, it’s worse. And sometimes, just… when I’m thinking too much. What does that even mean? You doctors always ask silly questions.
DOCTOR: I understand. A squeezing sensation that comes and goes, worsened with exertion like walking uphill, and sometimes when you're feeling stressed or thinking a lot. That’s helpful information, Mr. Sobkowicz. It doesn’t sound like a silly question at all – sometimes how we feel emotionally can absolutely affect how our body feels physically. Could you tell me how long this has been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Maybe… six months? Seven? Hard to say. Old man problems, you know? It’s not new. It just… gets worse sometimes. I don't keep track of these things. I have important things to do, not worry about my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s been going on for several months and fluctuates in intensity. Okay. And has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, besides walking uphill or thinking?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… make it happen? Hmm… When I argue with my wife. That always gets my heart going. And… when the neighbors play that loud music. Terrible music. Really gets under my skin. That makes my chest tight, for sure. Other than that… no. Just old age. Everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, so arguments with your wife and loud noises seem to bring it on. That gives us a bit more to work with. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest discomfort and fast heartbeat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And… I get tired easier now. Used to be able to work in the garden all day. Now, just a few minutes and I need to sit down. Is that important? Everything feels wrong when you get old.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important information, Mr. Sobkowicz. Lightheadedness and increased fatigue are definitely things we need to consider. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. My shoes fit fine. I don’t wear fancy shoes, just… practical ones. I walk a lot, you know? Good for the heart, they say. Though it doesn’t feel good right now. You doctors… always asking questions. Are we getting somewhere with this? I don't have time for this all day.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I apologize if the questions feel tedious. We are getting somewhere. No swelling in the ankles is good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have a primary care physician we can contact, or do you remember being diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – like diabetes, high cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Doctor… I go to a lot of doctors. I have a… a Korean doctor, somewhere in the city. I don’t remember his name. Too many names. And… high blood pressure, they told me. That’s why I’m here, right? They gave me pills, but… I don’t always take them. They make me feel… funny. Not good funny. Just tired. Old age problems, I tell you. Everything is a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure previously and were prescribed medication, but you don't consistently take it due to side effects. That's important information. Do you recall what medication you were taking, or perhaps have a list from your Korean doctor?
PATIENT: No. No list. I threw it away. Too many papers. Just… a little white pill. That’s all I remember. Small. And it made me sleepy. Very sleepy. I need to be awake, you know? I have things to do. Look, are you going to give me something to fix this or not? I haven't got all day. My wife is waiting. And she gets… unpleasant. When I'm late.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand your urgency. Before I prescribe anything, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. This will help me get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But no needles. I hate needles. And don't take too long. My wife… she doesn't understand. This whole thing… it’s a waste of time. Just fix it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Sobkowicz, I promise. Just a quick listen with my stethoscope. Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and I hear a slight irregularity in your heartbeat. Your pulses are a little weaker than I'd like. I also noticed some swelling in your ankles, which you didn't mention before. Is this new?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now you say it! I told you I don’t wear fancy shoes! It’s just… my feet are tired. They swell at the end of the day. Always have. It’s not new. You… you weren’t listening to me before! You doctors never listen. Just want to ask questions. Not hear the answers. What does it mean, all this…irregular and weak? Just fix it! I’m getting a headache now.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I apologize for not fully registering the ankle swelling earlier. It's my responsibility to listen carefully, and I'll make sure to do a better job. The irregularity in your heartbeat and the weaker pulses, combined with the elevated blood pressure and swelling in your ankles, suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to your high blood pressure not being well-controlled, or it could indicate a problem with how your heart is functioning. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart, a blood test to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a chest X-ray to see the size and shape of your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Oh, for goodness sake. My wife is going to kill me. All this… running around. And waiting. And more doctors. Look, can't you just give me a pill? Something strong? To fix it all? I don’t have time for tests. I have a garden to tend! And a wife to… appease. Just… something. Anything. To make it stop. This bump-bump-bump… it’s driving me crazy. Just give me a pill. Please. I’m an old man. I don't have time for this. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration and your desire for a quick solution. While I strongly believe getting these tests would give us a more accurate diagnosis and help me choose the best course of treatment, I respect your wishes. However, prescribing medication without a proper assessment carries risks. Given your history and the irregularities I’ve detected, I’m hesitant to simply prescribe something without knowing the underlying cause. What I can do is start you on a low dose of a blood pressure medication that is generally well-tolerated, and closely monitor your blood pressure and symptoms. We’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to see how you’re responding and discuss whether further testing is necessary. I will also give you a list of warning signs to look out for – such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting – and instruct you to go to the emergency room immediately if you experience any of those. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Sobkowicz?
