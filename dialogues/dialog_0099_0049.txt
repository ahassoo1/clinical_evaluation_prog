DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, have a seat. Eighty-three, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. Though, to be honest, the years all kinda blur together now, don’t they? It feels like just yesterday I was… well, I can’t rightly recall what I was doin’ yesterday, come to think of it. But eighty-three sounds about right, the paperwork probably knows better than I do.
DOCTOR: Paperwork usually does. Now, let's not dwell on yesterday. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my ears, dear. They just… aren't what they used to be. Folks mumble a lot these days, or maybe I’m the one mumblin’. Hard to tell, isn’t it? It’s just… difficult to hear things. Especially the television. And my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she talks a mile a minute, and I miss half of what she says. It’s kinda lonely, not bein’ able to keep up.
DOCTOR: Lonely, yes. Alright. So, difficulty hearing, primarily. Is it in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… both, maybe? It's hard to say for sure. They both seem kinda… fuzzy. Not painful, mind you, just… quiet. Like someone turned the volume down low. I can hear things, of course, like the birds chirpin’ outside, but people’s voices… they fade in and out, you know? It’s mostly worse when there’s a lot of noise around, I reckon.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy," right. And worse with background noise. Understandable. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that you mention it… sometimes. Not all the time, and it’s not a loud ringin’. More like… a faint hum. Like an old refrigerator, maybe? It comes and goes, and I usually don’t pay it much mind. It’s just… there, sometimes. Does that make sense? I'm not always sure what is a normal sound anymore.
DOCTOR: A faint hum. Right. And how long has this been going on, this difficulty hearing and the humming?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It feels like… a long time. Gradual, you know? It didn’t just happen overnight. Maybe… a few years, at least? I used to work in a shoe factory, a lot of clatter and banging. I always figured it was that. But honestly, I’ve gotten so used to things bein’ a bit… quiet, I can’t rightly say when it started botherin’ me enough to come see someone. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't be more precise.
DOCTOR: "Gradual." Of course. Shoe factory, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Schneer & Sons, it was called. My father started it, and I worked there most of my life. Operatin’ the machines, mostly. A lot of noise, like I said. Not the quietest job, but it put food on the table. Though, I always wondered if all that racket… well, never mind. Probably just an old man worryin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Let me see… I had a bit of a cold last winter, a nasty one. But that was… well, last winter. Nothing major, just sniffles and a cough. And I think I had the flu a couple of years back, but that’s about it. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just take it easy and stay indoors. Old age does a number on a fella, though, even if you’re careful. I haven't been sick sick, if that makes any sense. Mostly just tired.
DOCTOR: "Tired." Right. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Just this one, I think. The doctor gave it to me for my… well, for my joints, mostly. They ache somethin’ awful, especially when it rains. Says it’s arthritis, I believe. Can't read the small print so well these days. It’s a little white pill, that’s all I know. I take one every morning. And sometimes another one if it's particularly damp out.
DOCTOR: Naproxen. Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I eat just about anything, and I haven't been stung by a bee in… well, I can't even remember the last time I was stung by a bee! I'm not one for fancy foods or anything, so I haven't had much opportunity to be allergic to anything, I suppose. I think I'm pretty clear on that front. Though, my sister, bless her heart, was allergic to shellfish… but that wasn't me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look in your ears. Just to confirm what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good, dear. As long as it doesn’t involve any pokin’ and proddin’. I’m not fond of that, you know. Just a quick look, you say? I’ll try to hold still. Though my hands aren't as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Cerumen impaction. Significant wax buildup in both ears. Yes, quite a bit. That’s likely contributing to your difficulty hearing. And the redness… a bit of inflammation as well.
PATIENT: Wax buildup? Well, I never. I always thought ears were supposed to clean themselves. Is that… bad? Inflammation, you say? Sounds serious. Is it somethin’ I caught? What does that mean, exactly? Will I need… medicine?
DOCTOR: It's not "catching" anything, Mr. Schneer. It's a common occurrence, especially as we get older. The ear produces wax to protect itself, but sometimes it builds up. The inflammation is likely from the wax irritating the ear canal. We can remove the wax. It's a simple procedure. We’ll use ear irrigation. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it's generally well-tolerated. And no, you don’t need antibiotics, at least not yet. We'll see how you do after the wax removal.
PATIENT: Ear irrigation? Is that… water? In my ears? I don’t know, dear. That sounds… unpleasant. I’ve never had anything irrigated before. Is there… another way? Maybe just a little… suction? I’m not fond of water going in places it shouldn’t, you know. And if it’s uncomfortable… well, I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to things like that. Could it… hurt?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, suction can be used, but it’s not always effective and can sometimes be more irritating. Irrigation is the standard procedure, and it’s perfectly safe. It’s a gentle stream of water, not a fire hose. And yes, it might be slightly uncomfortable. But it's a brief discomfort, and the relief from your hearing loss will be worth it. Unless you prefer to remain unable to hear, we're going to proceed with the irrigation. Now, if you could just lean back…
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Alright, alright. If you say it’s best… but be gentle, now. And if it starts to hurt, you tell me right away. I’m not as young as I used to be, and I don’t bounce back like I used to. I suppose I should just get it over with… but I still think a little suction would have been nicer. Never did like water in my ears.
