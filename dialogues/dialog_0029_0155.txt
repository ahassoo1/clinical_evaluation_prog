DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I’m Dr. Chora. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes… it’s my hands, mostly. Been… well, it’s been a bit. Hard to say when exactly it started, to be honest. It just sort of… is. I figured I should probably get it checked out, though. Don't want it getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. A tremor in your hands… and you've noticed it gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradually… yes, that sounds right. Or maybe it comes and goes? It’s tricky. Some days it’s barely noticeable, other days… well, trying to hold a cup of coffee is a bit of a challenge. I used to work with… pipes, lots of pipes. Water and… things. Maybe it’s from that? I don’t know. Everything feels a bit foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it fluctuates – some days better, some days worse. And you mentioned previous work involving pipes… was there any exposure to anything specific in that line of work?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Chemicals, probably. All sorts of things went through those pipes. Cleaning stuff, too. We used… chlorine, I think? And other things with long names. Honestly, Doctor, it was a long time ago, and I mostly just remember tightening bolts and checking gauges. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to become less clear with time. We can try to piece things together. Besides the hand tremor and the previous work, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Uh… well, I feel a bit… unsteady on my feet sometimes. Not falling or anything, just… off balance. And I get tired easier, I suppose. It could just be my age, though. Seventy-nine years will do that to a fella. I haven’t really been sick sick, if that makes sense. Just… worn out. Oh, and my handwriting’s gotten terrible. Even worse than it was before! But again, old age…
DOCTOR: Okay, so unsteady gait, fatigue, and worsening handwriting in addition to the tremor. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can. Just point it out, Doctor. I'm trying to keep still… it’s a little difficult, honestly. Everything feels a bit… jumpy today. Is this going to take long? I have… things to get back to.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. Just want to get a baseline. Okay, now can you tap your finger to your thumb repeatedly, as fast as you can, for about ten seconds?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. It feels like I’m fighting my own hand. Is that fast enough? Or do you want me to try longer? I’m not very good at these things, I’ll admit.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm seeing a tremor at rest and with movement. Now, could you please extend both of your arms in front of you, palms up, for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… it’s pretty bad, isn’t it? It feels like a little earthquake in my arms. I hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting the tremor is present bilaterally and appears more pronounced with outstretched arms. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. I'm going to lightly tap on your knees and elbows.
PATIENT: Okay, knees and elbows… all right. Just let me know if it’s too much, Doctor. I don’t have the best nerves these days. Just a little tap, right? Not a whack? Because I don’t want to jump out of my skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little slow, but symmetrical. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Breathing… yes, I’m breathing. Everything feels a bit tight in my chest sometimes, but I think that's just… age. I used to smoke, a long time ago. Quit years ago, thank goodness. But sometimes I still feel it. Is everything alright so far, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear. Given your symptoms – the tremor, unsteady gait, fatigue, and handwriting changes – and your history, I suspect we're dealing with a possible essential tremor. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying causes. Also, a neurological consultation would be beneficial to get a more definitive diagnosis. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. But I haven't taken much medication lately. Just… over-the-counter stuff for aches and pains. Blood work and… a neurologist? That sounds… complicated. Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to know what we're dealing with. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions. It's not necessarily serious, but it does need to be investigated. Essential tremor, if that's what it is, is usually not life-threatening, but it can interfere with daily life. The blood work and the neurologist will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, like Parkinson’s disease or other neurological conditions. We’ll start with the blood work. I’ll write you a requisition, and you can get that done at the lab down the street. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: Insurance? No, no insurance, Doctor. Haven’t had it in years. Too expensive, you know? Just… out of pocket, I guess. This is going to be expensive, isn’t it? I don’t know if I can afford all this. I'm on a fixed income. Perhaps… perhaps we can just skip the neurologist? If it’s just… old age…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost. A neurological consultation can be expensive. However, given the nature of your symptoms, it's important to get a proper diagnosis. We can explore options for financial assistance at the hospital. I will write the requisition for the bloodwork first. Then, we can discuss options for a neurologist referral if the bloodwork doesn’t give us a clear answer. I’ll also give you a list of resources for low-cost healthcare options in the area. Here is the lab requisition. It's a standard panel, and the cost should be relatively manageable. Do you have any questions about where the lab is located or how to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Okay, blood work first… yes, that makes sense. A list of resources… that would be very helpful, Doctor, thank you. I don't know where to start looking for these things. Down the street, you said? I think I remember seeing a sign… Yes, I can probably find it. And… you’ll call me with the results? When should I expect to hear back? I just want to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within 3-5 business days. And we'll go from there. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions in the meantime. I will have the nurse print out a list of resources for you before you leave. Have a good day, Mr. Jezik.
