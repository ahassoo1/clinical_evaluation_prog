DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here today… well, to see if my mother is able to receive care at home. She is… quite elderly, and it is becoming difficult to manage everything on my own. I believe you call it “home health” or perhaps “hospice”? I am unsure of the correct terms, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you're looking into options for support at home for your mother. Both “home health” and “hospice” are possibilities, but they are quite different. Home health is generally for someone who is recovering from an illness or injury and needs skilled nursing care, physical therapy, or occupational therapy. Hospice is for someone with a limited life expectancy, focusing on comfort and symptom management. To determine the best course of action, could you tell me a little bit more about your mother’s current health condition?
PATIENT: Yes, that explains it well, Doctor. Thank you. My mother… she is 92 years old. She has been… quite frail for some time. She recently fell and broke her hip, and although it has been repaired, she is not recovering well. She is very weak, and she has trouble eating. The doctors… they said she may not have much time left. She is mostly just… sleeping now. It is very difficult to see. I worry about her comfort, mostly. And, frankly, I am not sure I can provide the level of care she needs on my own. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like hospice care is likely the more appropriate option, given her age, the recent hip fracture, and the doctors’ assessment. But we need to confirm that’s the right fit. Before we proceed, I’d like to get a more detailed medical history. Do you have access to her medical records, or would you prefer I request them from her primary care physician and any specialists she’s seen?
PATIENT: I do, actually. I have a folder with everything. I took it upon myself to organize it after… after my divorce. My wife always said I worried too much, but I prefer to be prepared. It includes everything from her vaccinations to the reports from the hospital after the fall. I brought it with me today, just in case.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That will be very helpful. Please, feel free to take your time. We'll go through it together. I'll start by asking a few general questions while you locate the most recent hospital discharge summary. First, does your mother have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. She… she has a mild allergy to penicillin. It’s not severe, just a bit of a rash, but we always inform doctors. And… she dislikes shellfish, but that is a preference, not an allergy. Nothing else, as far as I know. She has always been quite… resilient, my mother.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s important to know. And aside from the hip fracture, does she have any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. She had… type 2 diabetes for many years, but it was well-managed with medication. She also… she had a heart condition, atrial fibrillation, I believe the doctor called it. She was on medication for that as well. The cardiologist… he said it was stable, but it required regular monitoring. And… she has some arthritis, mostly in her hands and knees. It causes her some pain, but it is… manageable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and arthritis. And is she currently taking any medications for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, quite a few, I’m afraid. Let me see… for the diabetes, she takes Metformin, 500 milligrams twice a day. For the atrial fibrillation, she is on… Apixaban, 20 milligrams once a day. And for the arthritis, she takes Ibuprofen, as needed, but not regularly. She also takes a daily multivitamin and… a calcium supplement for her bones. I have a complete list here, with the dosages, if you would like.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. This is very helpful. Now, has she had any surgeries in the past, other than the recent hip repair?
PATIENT: Yes. Many years ago… about twenty years ago, she had a gallbladder removed. And… she had a cataract surgery in both eyes, one after the other, about ten years ago. Both went well, thankfully. She was very happy to not need glasses for a while, but eventually she needed them again.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and cataract surgeries. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question. My mother… she didn’t discuss family history much. Her parents… they both passed away when she was young, from illnesses I don’t recall the specifics of. She had one brother, but he passed away several years ago from… heart disease, I believe. I don’t know much about any other relatives. She was… rather private about those things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. We can work with what we have. Finally, let's talk about social history. Does your mother live alone, or does she have assistance with daily living?
PATIENT: She lived alone… until recently. I moved her in with me about six months ago, when she started having trouble managing on her own. I work from home, so I am able to provide her with most of the care she needs. But… it is becoming increasingly difficult. I am not a nurse, you understand. I do my best, but I worry I am not able to give her the proper attention she deserves.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been doing a wonderful job, Mr. Bahta, but it’s completely understandable that you’re reaching a point where you need additional support. Now, let’s briefly discuss her end-of-life wishes. Has your mother expressed any preferences regarding her care, such as a Do Not Resuscitate order or a living will?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. We never really discussed it, truthfully. My mother… she was always very stoic, very private. She never talked about death. I believe she would want to be comfortable, mostly. She always valued her dignity. I… I suppose I would be making those decisions for her, if it came to that. I would want to ensure she is not in pain, and that she is treated with respect.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. We can certainly work with that. It’s good to know her preference for comfort and dignity. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I’d like to listen to her heart and lungs, check her blood pressure, and assess her overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary. She is… upstairs, in the guest bedroom. I have everything prepared, a comfortable chair, good lighting. I apologize for the state of the house, it is not always tidy.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Bahta. Let’s go ahead and take a look at your mother. I appreciate you being so prepared.
