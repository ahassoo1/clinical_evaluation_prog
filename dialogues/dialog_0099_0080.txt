DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Overgaard. Just need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me over here to do that. I don’t really know what all needs to be done, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Forms, right. Medicare… always with the paperwork. It's not simply filling out forms, Ms. Fabing. We need to understand why Medicare is sending you, what your health concerns are. It's a basic medical assessment. We can’t just blindly complete forms without knowing what we’re documenting. It’s… irresponsible. So, let's start with the basics. Have you been experiencing any health problems lately?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, I understand. Sorry, I didn't realize it was more than just…signing things. Hmm. Let me think… Not really, no. Nothing major, anyway. My knees get a little creaky when the weather changes, you know? And I get tired easier than I used to, but I figure that’s just getting older. I'm 35, but working with pipes all day is hard on the body. Is that what you mean? Like, should I be listing the knee thing?
DOCTOR: "Getting older?
PATIENT: Well, maybe not old, but you know… life. It adds up. But yes, the knee thing is good to know. And the tiredness too. Do you feel tired all the time, or just after work? And does anything make it better or worse?
DOCTOR: Right. "Adds up." I see. And how long have you been experiencing this… fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, that's a good question. It's been creeping up on me, I guess. Maybe the last six months or so? It’s not like I can’t get through the day, but at the end of it, I just… collapse on the couch. And even on weekends, I feel like I could sleep for days. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. I try to get enough rest, but it doesn’t really help. Just feels like…a heaviness, you know?
DOCTOR: “Heaviness.” Interesting. And you mentioned you work with pipes… that’s physically demanding work, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. A lot of bending, lifting, crawling around in tight spaces. It's control and valve stuff, mostly. Making sure everything's working right, fixing leaks, installing new parts. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. I've been doing it for about ten years now. It's good work, usually, but it can be rough on the body, like I said. Sometimes I come home covered in grime and aching all over. I usually take a long bath, but that only helps so much. Does that matter? Knowing what I do all day?
DOCTOR: It matters, Ms. Fabing. Everything matters. Though frankly, I find people often volunteer irrelevant details. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I guess I have been a little more… short-tempered lately. My husband, Dale, keeps saying I'm cranky. Which isn't like me, usually. And… oh! My hands have been a little numb sometimes, especially at night. Just my fingertips, mostly. It comes and goes. Is that the same thing as the tiredness? Or is that a new symptom? Sorry, I'm trying to remember everything…
DOCTOR: "Cranky" and "numbness"... These are not insignificant, Ms. Fabing. It seems you are experiencing a constellation of symptoms, and to simply dismiss them as 'getting older' would be… negligent. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hands might feel a little puffy sometimes, but I figured that was just from being on my feet all day. No actual swelling, though. And my feet are okay. I wear work boots, so they’re usually pretty tired, but not swollen. Is this… is something serious, Dr. Overgaard? I’m starting to get a little worried. Dale said I should come in, but I didn't think it was that bad.
DOCTOR: “Not thinking it was that bad” is often the problem, Ms. Fabing. People underestimate their own physiology. We'll need to do a basic physical exam, and likely some bloodwork. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I haven’t really taken anything except for pain relievers, like ibuprofen, when my knees act up. No reactions to those. And I’m not allergic to penicillin or anything like that. Dale’s got some allergies, but I don’t. I've never had a problem with medicine before. Does that include things like… food allergies? I eat pretty much everything. Sorry, I’m trying to be thorough. I just don’t really think about these things unless someone asks.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just ibuprofen when I need it, but that’s it. Dale keeps telling me I should take something for my joints, but I haven't gotten around to it. I try to eat healthy, mostly, so I figured that was enough. I drink a lot of water, too. Does that matter? Drinking water? I'm starting to feel silly listing everything.
DOCTOR: "Listing everything" is precisely what is required, Ms. Fabing. Although I doubt the water intake is a contributing factor. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. My family… well, my dad had some heart trouble when he got older, but that was a long time ago. And my mom had arthritis, but that runs in her family. I haven't had any major illnesses or surgeries or anything like that. Just the usual colds and flu. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, but that’s it. I’m hoping this isn’t something serious. I just want to get back to work. Dale worries about me, you know? He says I push myself too hard. I do feel a little dizzy sometimes, now that I think about it. Is that a new symptom? I’m sorry, I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: "Rambling" suggests a lack of focus, Ms. Fabing. But, very well. Let's proceed. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even tonsils or anything. I've been lucky, I guess. Always managed to avoid the hospital. I don't really like doctors, to be honest. That's why I put off coming in for so long. But Dale insisted. He said I needed to get checked out. He's a good man. Does that matter? Talking about Dale? I'm just trying to be helpful. I really don't want to be a bother. This dizziness is new, I think. It's not bad, just a little… woozy sometimes. Especially when I stand up too fast.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, your personal relationships are irrelevant. The dizziness is relevant. Now, tell me about your family history. Do your parents or siblings have any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. My mom, like I said, had arthritis. Real bad when she got older. She couldn't even walk without a cane. My dad… he had some heart trouble, but it wasn’t diagnosed until he was in his seventies. He smoked for years, so that probably didn't help. And my brother, he’s got high blood pressure, but he doesn’t take care of himself very well. He eats a lot of fast food and doesn’t exercise. I try to be healthier than both of them. Does that matter? Comparing myself to my family? I really just want to know if something is wrong with me. This is making me nervous. Dale always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Worrying is a symptom, Ms. Fabing. But, very well. Now, have you ever smoked, or used any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. Never. I've never touched a cigarette or anything like that. My parents didn’t smoke, and I always thought it was a terrible habit. And I definitely don't do drugs. Dale wouldn't approve. I’ve always been a pretty straight-laced person, to be honest. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Does that matter? The wine? This is starting to feel like an interrogation. I just want to know if something is wrong with me, and if there's anything I can do about it. This dizziness is making it hard to concentrate. I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded just talking about it.
DOCTOR: "Lightheadedness" is a significant detail, Ms. Fabing. Now, let’s discuss your social history. What is your occupation, and what are your typical daily activities?
PATIENT: We already talked about my occupation! I’m a control and valve installer and repairer. I work with pipes all day. Bending, lifting, crawling around… it’s hard work. As for daily activities… well, I go to work, come home, cook dinner, watch TV with Dale, go to bed. Sometimes we go out with friends, but not very often. It’s pretty much the same routine every day. I guess I don’t have a very exciting life. Does that matter? Talking about my routine? I’m just trying to answer your questions. This dizziness is getting worse, I think. It’s hard to stand up without feeling like I’m going to fall over. I’m starting to get really worried now. Dale said I should come in if I was feeling dizzy, and I wish I hadn’t waited so long.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fabing. Enough with the irrelevant details. It is clear that a comprehensive physical examination is required. Please follow me. I will need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, we will discuss potential bloodwork. And, despite your attempts to downplay your symptoms, I strongly suggest we consider a referral to a neurologist. Now, if you will please follow me to the examination room.
PATIENT: A neurologist? Is something really wrong? I thought it was just… being tired. This is scaring me, Dr. Overgaard. I don't like the sound of a neurologist. Dale's going to be worried too. But okay… okay, I'll follow you. Just please tell me what you're looking for. And try not to scare me too much. This dizziness is really bad right now. I feel like I might…… I don't know. Just please hurry.
DOCTOR: "Scaring you" is not my intention, Ms. Fabing, but a thorough assessment is paramount. A neurologist specializes in the nervous system. Your symptoms – dizziness, fatigue, numbness – could indicate a variety of issues, and a specialist is best equipped to determine the cause. Now, please sit on the examination table. I will begin with your blood pressure. We'll take things one step at a time. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… good. Relax… right. It's just hard when I feel like I'm going to fall over. And I keep worrying about what you're going to find. Dale’s going to kill me if I have to go to a specialist. He hates going to doctors even more than I do. … Just please be quick. And try not to find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130 over 85. Elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I need to check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Keep your head still. Can you follow it?
PATIENT: Yes… I can follow it. It’s… okay. Just a little hard to concentrate. My head feels… fuzzy. And I keep feeling like I’m going to lose my balance. Is this… is this normal? I’m getting a little scared again. What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are slightly jerky, Ms. Fabing. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes… I can. It’s…a little shaky, though. My arms feel…weak. And I keep wanting to sway. Is something really wrong, Dr. Overgaard? Please tell me. Dale is going to be so worried…
DOCTOR: Your coordination is impaired, Ms. Fabing. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Now the other leg. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: Oh… that was… surprising. And squeezing… like this? It's…hard. My hands feel…tingly. And I'm getting a headache now. Is this bad? Really bad? Dale always said I worry too much, but… I think I have a reason to be worried now. This doesn't feel right. Not right at all.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are diminished, and your grip strength is significantly reduced. Ms. Fabing, I am concerned. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms – dizziness, fatigue, numbness, headache – are indicative of a neurological issue. I strongly recommend an immediate referral to a neurologist for further evaluation, including an MRI. We need to rule out a serious underlying condition. I will order blood work to check for common causes, but a neurological workup is crucial. I will also have the nurse draw blood samples now.
PATIENT: MRI? Serious condition? What… what kind of condition? Is it… is it something bad? Like… like a brain tumor? Oh, Dale… he’s going to be so scared. I… I don’t want an MRI. I’ve always been claustrophobic. Please… can’t we just… try something else? Maybe I just need some rest. Or vitamins. Or… something. I don’t want to go to the hospital. I don’t want a neurologist. Please… help me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, panicking will not help. An MRI is a diagnostic tool, not a sentence. It will allow us to determine the cause of your symptoms, not confirm a worst-case scenario. It is irresponsible to dismiss a potential neurological issue based on anxiety. I understand your claustrophobia, and we can discuss options like anti-anxiety medication or an open MRI, if available. But delaying a diagnosis could have serious consequences. We need to rule out potentially life-threatening conditions, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or, yes, a brain tumor. I will explain the procedure in detail, and the nurse will discuss options for managing your anxiety. But I assure you, avoiding a diagnosis is not an option. We are doing this for your health, Ms. Fabing. And I will be here to guide you through every step of the process. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, you’re right. Panicking… isn’t helping. And you’re right about needing to know. It’s just… scary. A brain tumor… I can’t even think about it. And the MRI… being closed in… oh, Dale… he’s going to be so worried. … Anti-anxiety medication… okay, maybe that would help. And an open MRI… if that’s possible. … Just… please be quick. And please… try to make it as easy as possible. I’m really scared. And I don't want to do this alone.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Fabing. We will do everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible. The nurse is highly experienced in managing anxious patients, and we will discuss all your options for managing your claustrophobia. We can schedule the MRI for a time when you feel most relaxed, and you are welcome to bring Dale with you for support. I will also write a detailed referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly regarded neurologist in the area, and include all my findings and concerns. Now, let’s focus on the immediate next step: the blood work. It will provide us with some additional information, and hopefully, ease some of your anxiety. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the procedure. You are not alone, Ms. Fabing. We will face this together.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, blood work first. That… sounds manageable. Dale… yes, I’ll definitely bring Dale. He’ll… he’ll know what to do. … Dr. Sharma… I’ll… I’ll look her up. … Thank you… for being patient. And for… for not dismissing me. I appreciate it. I really do. … Let’s just… get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fabing. That’s the spirit. The nurse will be right in. I will step out to give you some privacy. Please do not hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Remember, we’re doing this to get you the answers you need. .
