DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Solero. Oh, it’s lovely to meet you as well. Just these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, it feels like ages, honestly. Not painful, you understand, just… persistent. A bit annoying, is all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent hiccups can certainly be bothersome, even if they aren't painful. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when they started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It was right around… the first week of July, I’d say. It was after… oh, dear, what was I doing? My granddaughter, Leilani, came to visit. Yes! That’s it. We were having a lovely lunch – she made her famous passionfruit tart – and I just… started hiccuping. And they haven't really stopped since. It wasn’t a shock or anything, just… happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they began around the first week of July, coinciding with your granddaughter’s visit and a meal together. And you said it wasn’t brought on by anything startling, it just started spontaneously. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse, or perhaps anything that seems to help, even a little?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Nothing really makes them worse, I don’t think. I mean, sometimes laughing does, but who wants to avoid laughing? And… drinking water too quickly can set them off, maybe. As for helping… well, holding my breath sometimes does for a little while, but it doesn’t last. Leilani tried to scare me once, thought that might work, but no luck! Just made us both giggle, and then more hiccups.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've already tried a few common remedies! Holding your breath can sometimes work temporarily, as you’ve discovered. Now, besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been eating okay, sleeping okay, no heartburn, no trouble breathing… Oh! Wait a minute. I have been feeling a little bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it. But I thought that was just… getting older, you know? I am 86, after all. Could be that. I haven’t felt sick or anything, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. It’s always important to consider everything, and you’re right, fatigue can come with age. But it’s good you mentioned it. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, when I was maybe in my sixties? And I used to have high blood pressure, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. Just a little pill every morning. Oh, and I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, but that healed up nicely. No problems with that anymore. Apart from that… I think that’s it. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal many years ago, a history of high blood pressure currently well-controlled with medication, and a hip replacement about ten years ago. That's very helpful. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. The blood pressure pill. Oh, wait! Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands. Just when they're really bothering me, though. It's a cream, you rub it on. Doesn't always help, but it's worth a try. I think it's called… diclofenac? Something like that. I don't use it every day, maybe a couple of times a week if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication regularly, and diclofenac cream as needed for arthritis in your hands. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about everything – Leilani brings me all sorts of exotic fruits, and I always try them! No problems there. And I haven’t noticed any allergies to plants or anything like that. I used to garden a lot, and never had any trouble with pollen or anything. I think I’m pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies is very good. Alright, Mrs. Sucich, before I do a quick physical exam, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be 92, but she had a bit of trouble with her heart in the end. And my brother, he had diabetes. But other than that… not a lot that I can think of. My father was pretty healthy all his life, and I don't really know much about my grandparents. They passed away when I was quite young. It’s not a family that talked much about their health, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had heart trouble and your brother had diabetes. That's helpful to know. Now, lastly, before the exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What does that mean? Well, I’m divorced, have been for a very long time now. No children, sadly. But I have my granddaughter, Leilani, she’s my whole world. I live on my own, still independent as can be. I enjoy reading, gardening when I can, and visiting with friends. I go to church on Sundays. And I love a good cup of tea! Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Mrs. Sucich. Yes, that’s exactly what I meant. I just wanted to get a picture of your lifestyle. Alright, well, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your throat and ears. Just a quick exam, nothing to worry about. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m not worried at all. You seem very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Sucich, if you could just take a deep breath in and out for me. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths, please. Alright, and I'm just going to take a quick look at your throat now. Say "Ah" for me. And finally, I'll just take a quick look at your ears. Okay, all done. Everything sounds and looks pretty good, Mrs. Sucich. I did notice a faint heart murmur, which is not uncommon at your age, but it’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh, a heart murmur, you say? Well, I am 86, as you know. I suppose things start to wear out eventually. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something I should be worried about? Is that what's causing these hiccups, do you think?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mrs. Sucich. The murmur itself isn't necessarily something to be immediately worried about, especially given your age. Many people develop innocent heart murmurs as they get older due to changes in the heart valves. However, it’s good to know it’s there, so we can monitor it. As for the hiccups, it’s unlikely the murmur is directly causing them. Hiccups can be caused by a variety of things – sometimes they just happen! But given how long they’ve been going on, and to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a few simple tests. Would you be okay with a chest X-ray and some blood work?
PATIENT: Oh, tests, you say? Well, if it'll help figure out what's causing these hiccups, then yes, that’s fine. I don't mind a bit of poking and prodding if it means getting some answers. A chest X-ray and blood work, you said? Will the blood work be a lot? I don’t like having too much blood taken, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll just need a standard blood draw, nothing too extensive. It will help us check your electrolyte levels, look for any signs of infection, and get a general picture of your overall health. It shouldn't be a lot of blood, just a few vials. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart, and rule out any underlying issues there. I’ll write you a requisition for both tests. You can get them done at the lab just down the street, and they should only take about half an hour. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Half an hour, you say? That's not bad at all. Down the street, too, that’s convenient. You're very thorough, you know. I appreciate you taking the time to look into these hiccups properly. So, a requisition for the tests… and then a follow-up appointment? Is there anything else I need to do? Or anything I should be avoiding in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sucich. I’m glad I could reassure you. I’ll print out the requisition now. In the meantime, there’s nothing specific you need to avoid. Continue to eat a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and get plenty of rest. If the hiccups become severely debilitating, or you develop any other symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, just try to relax and we’ll get these results back as quickly as possible. Here you are. The lab will need your insurance information, of course. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Yes, I have my insurance card right here. And no, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, really. It’s just these hiccups… they’re so persistent! But I feel much better knowing we’re looking into it. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. I appreciate your kindness. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sucich. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a wonderful day, and try not to worry too much about those hiccups. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. I will try not to worry. Thank you again. And Doctor? You're a very good doctor. .
