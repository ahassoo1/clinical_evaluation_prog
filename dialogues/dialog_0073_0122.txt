DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been noticing some things with my memory. Small things, mostly. But they are…more frequent now. I am Venus Alvara, by the way. Perhaps you have my chart? It is about my memory, and…my blood pressure is high, the nurse said.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, I do have your chart here. High blood pressure and some concerns about memory… alright. “Small things, mostly” is rather vague, I'm afraid. Could you give me a specific example of one of these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Specific… yes. Let me think. Just yesterday, I went to the market. I made a list, I always make a list. But when I got there… I could not remember why I went. I stood there for a good five minutes, looking at the list, and… nothing. I eventually remembered I needed tomatoes, but it took a very long time. And it felt… strange. It is not forgetting what tomatoes are, just… the purpose. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you had the means to accomplish the task – the list – but not the intention readily available. And this is a recent development?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The intention… that is a good way to put it. And yes, very recent. Perhaps the last month, maybe six weeks. Before that, I had no problems. I always remember everything. I pride myself on my memory, to be honest. It is… worrying, this change. I manage many properties, you see. I need to remember details.
DOCTOR: Managing properties… that would require a good memory. And you say this is causing you concern, impacting your ability to do your work?
PATIENT: It is beginning to. Not yet a major impact, but I find myself…double-checking things constantly. Writing notes about notes. It takes more time, and it is… frustrating. I had a meeting last week, and I forgot the name of a client immediately after introducing him to another person. It was… embarrassing. And I do not forget names, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My husband… he passed away six months ago. It was… sudden. I have been…adjusting. Sleeping is not always easy. And I do not have much appetite. But I thought those were… natural things, grieving. I have not been feeling particularly…sad, just…empty. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Alvara. Loss is a significant stressor. We'll certainly need to consider that. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: As far as I know, no. The high blood pressure, of course, but that was only recently diagnosed. I have had a few headaches, but nothing serious. I used to have very good health. I walk every day, I eat… reasonably well. I have never been a smoker. My husband… he had some heart trouble, but I do not. I do not take any medications, except for a small pill for the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: And what is the name of that blood pressure medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: I… I do not. The doctor at the clinic… he prescribed it. I just give the name to the pharmacy. I do not… memorize medication names. I am sorry. It is a small, white pill. Perhaps you can find it in my file?
DOCTOR: Yes, here we are. Amlodipine, 5 milligrams. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I am aware of. I eat shellfish, I take antibiotics when I need them… I have never had a reaction to anything. My husband… he was allergic to penicillin, but I am not. I always tell doctors this, just in case. Is that all? I feel a little silly, trying to remember all this. It is the memory, you see.
DOCTOR: It is not silly at all, Ms. Alvara. It is quite common to feel overwhelmed when discussing medical history, especially with recent changes. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: That is a good question. My mother… she became forgetful in her later years. She did not know where she was sometimes. The doctor said it was “old age”. She lived to be 92. My father… he had heart problems, but no memory issues. My siblings… I have a brother and a sister. Neither of them have mentioned any problems. But we do not… talk about these things very often. Is that helpful? I wish I had better information.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Alvara. Any family history, even vague recollections, is useful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a glass of wine. My husband… he enjoyed a small brandy sometimes, but I do not. I do not like the taste. I prefer tea. And I drink a lot of water. Is that all right? I thought it was… important to stay hydrated. Especially with the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I find that question… a little insulting, to be honest. I am a professional, I manage properties. I do not engage in such activities. I hope you understand. I simply want to understand what is happening with my memory.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. I apologize if that question was insensitive. It is standard procedure to ask, but I understand your discomfort. Now, before we proceed, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. I would like to know what is happening, so a physical examination is… logical. I would appreciate a thorough check, if that is possible. Perhaps it is nothing, just a little stress. But I want to be sure. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll check your vital signs. Blood pressure is currently 148 over 92. Pulse is 76 and regular. Respiratory rate is 16, and your temperature is normal. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Your gait is steady, but slightly cautious. Balance is good. Okay, Ms. Alvara, can you spell the word “WORLD” backwards for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… D-L-R-O-W. Is that correct? I… I hope so. It is not as easy as it sounds. And what about the three objects? I believe the nurse showed me some…a key, a flower, and a… a cup? Was that correct? I am trying to remember. It is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Correct on the spelling, Ms. Alvara. And you remembered two out of three objects – the key and the flower. The cup was the one you missed. Based on the brief examination and your reported symptoms, it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. Your blood pressure is elevated, which could contribute to some cognitive difficulties. The slight murmur warrants further investigation, but is unlikely to be the primary cause of your memory issues. The missed object on the cognitive test is concerning, but could be attributed to stress or anxiety. I recommend a few further tests: a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I would also like to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, given your recent loss, I strongly recommend consulting with a therapist or grief counselor. It is important to address your emotional well-being. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot of tests. But if it will help determine what is happening… yes, acceptable. I would like to know. And a therapist… yes, perhaps that would be useful. I have been… functioning, but it is not the same. The MRI… is it painful? I do not like enclosed spaces. And how long will all this take? I have responsibilities, you see. I need to manage properties, people are relying on me. I just want to be sure it is not something… serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. The MRI is not painful, but it does involve lying in a relatively narrow tube. We can discuss options for managing any anxiety you might have, such as medication or an open MRI if available. The blood tests will take only a few minutes, and the results should be available within a couple of days. The MRI will require about 30 to 45 minutes, and the radiologist will need a few days to interpret the results. I will call you as soon as I have everything, and we can discuss the findings and develop a plan. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on stress reduction techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. I will write referrals for the blood tests, MRI, and a therapist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… patience. It is unsettling, not knowing. I will schedule the tests as soon as possible. And I will consider the therapist. Perhaps it is time. I believe that is all. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. .
