DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… well, it’s… something down there. It’s… leaking. A little. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It’s kinda… icky. I don’t know what it is. I haven’t had this happen before, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: "Leaking," you say. Alright. Well, let's try to get a bit more specific. When did you first notice this happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m terrible with dates. Maybe… a week ago? Or was it longer? Everything kinda blends together, you know? It just… started. I woke up one morning and there it was. It’s not hurting, thankfully, just… messy. I cleaned it up right away, of course. A lady has to keep herself clean.
DOCTOR: Of course. And it's only happening when you… urinate?
PATIENT: No, no. Not just when I go pee. It happens… other times. When I'm just… sitting. Or lying down. It’s not a lot, mind you, but it's there. It’s… unsettling. And it smells funny, too. Not a good smell. A kinda… sour smell. I hope you don't mind me saying so. It’s embarrassing, even talkin' about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, not exclusively with urination. And you describe a… sour odor. Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your bladder habits besides this leakage?
PATIENT: Bladder habits? You mean… do I go to the bathroom more? Maybe. I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. I go when I need to go. I think… I might be going a little more often lately, but that could be because I’m drinking more water. It’s been hot, you know. Gotta stay hydrated. Honestly, doctor, I just want this…leakage…to stop. It’s very undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we're going to need to do a quick exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Have you ever had anything like this checked before, or any gynecological exams recently?
PATIENT: Gyne… what? Exams? Oh, goodness, no. Not for… a long, long time. Back when my husband was alive, maybe. But that was… decades ago. And this isn’t… that kind of problem. It’s… down there. You know? A man’s problem. I wouldn’t know the first thing about those fancy woman’s exams. Is this something serious, doctor? You’re makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: It's good to get these things checked out, Mrs. Genard. We need to rule things out. It could be a number of things, and the exam will help us determine the cause. We’ll just need to take a look. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. And yes, I understand your concerns. Now, I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll have a chaperone with me, of course. We'll start with a simple external exam, okay?
PATIENT: External? Oh. Well… alright. But I’m not real comfortable with strangers pokin’ around. I’m an old lady. And I like my privacy. Is this chaperone someone I know? I don’t want just anyone lookin’ at… that part of me. Honestly, doctor, you’re makin' me blush. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, the chaperone is a registered nurse, and it's standard procedure to ensure patient comfort and privacy. It's for your protection and ours. I assure you, she is professional and discreet. We can certainly wait if you are not ready, but a diagnosis requires a physical assessment. It's rather difficult to determine the cause of the leakage without looking. Before we proceed, let me ask: do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials we might use during the exam?
