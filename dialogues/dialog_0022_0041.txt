DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but… little by little. It makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness that’s been gradually worsening. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It started in my legs, I think… maybe a year ago? Just a little harder to get up from the chair, you know? Now… now it’s in my arms too. Makes it hard to… hold things. Even a cup of coffee sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began in your legs about a year ago, and has slowly progressed to involve your arms as well. And it's affecting your ability to do things like hold a cup. Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. But… it feels like the bad days are getting more frequent. And even on the good days, I have to think about it, you know? Not like before. It's tiring.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s fluctuating, and even on better days it requires more effort. That does sound concerning, especially with the progression. Besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes. My vision… it gets blurry sometimes. And I get… tired. Very tired. Not just regular tired, but… heavy. Like I’m carrying something. And… sometimes my balance is off. I haven’t fallen, but I feel unsteady. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Blurry vision, fatigue – a heavy feeling you describe – and some unsteadiness. Okay. Let's try to get a clearer picture of everything. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Bowel and bladder… Well, now that you mention it… sometimes it’s harder to… go. Not always, but more often than it used to be. And sometimes… I have to go more often. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Asthore, it’s important information and nothing to be embarrassed about. We need to cover all the bases. So, some difficulty and increased frequency with urination. Have you experienced any pain with urination, or noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain. And no blood, Doctor. Just… harder to start, and I feel like I have to go more often, even if it’s not much. It's just… a nuisance, mostly. But I wanted to tell you everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with… something a long time ago. The doctor said it affects the nerves. Multiple… sclerosis, I think that’s what he called it. It’s been a while, and I don’t remember all the details. He gave me some pills for a while, but I haven't taken them in a long time. They didn't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and were on medication for it, but you discontinued it due to lack of benefit. Do you remember approximately when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Let me think… it must have been… oh, maybe twenty years ago? Or more. It was before my wife passed, definitely. So… a long time. The doctor kept saying it was a lifelong thing, but… I just tried to live my life, you know? I didn't want to focus on being sick.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Asthore. It sounds like you’ve been very resilient. Twenty years ago, then. And besides the multiple sclerosis, have you had any other significant medical issues, like pneumonia, heart attacks, or strokes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And my hip was giving me trouble a few years back, but I just took some pain pills for that. Nothing serious. I've always been a strong man, Doctor. I try to take care of myself. But this weakness… it's different. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes. I had my appendix taken out when I was young. And… I had a surgery on my shoulder a long time ago, after I hurt it playing football. That’s about it, I think. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… My wife passed away a few years back, like I said. I have three children, all grown up now, living on the mainland. And… a few grandchildren. My mother had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a weak heart, I remember that. Nothing else that I can really think of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any pills before. I'm pretty lucky that way, I think. It's just this… this weakness. It's starting to scare me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Asthore. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Not even vitamins. Like I said, I haven’t been on any pills in a long time. I prefer to just… try and get by on my own.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Asthore. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. We’ll need to investigate that further. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which can be common with nerve issues. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Okay, your strength is good, but you do fatigue more easily. Now I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Okay, your balance is a little unsteady, and you have some difficulty with coordination. Finally, I'm going to check your feet for sensation. Okay, sensation is diminished in your feet. Based on the exam, we have several findings that are concerning – diminished reflexes and sensation, weakness, unsteadiness, and mild crackles in your lungs. Given your history of multiple sclerosis, the diminished reflexes and sensation could be related to that, but the new crackles in your lungs and worsening weakness warrant further investigation. I'd like to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to start. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a chest X-ray… okay. Will that tell us what’s going on? I just want to know what’s happening to me. This… this is frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Asthore. It is frightening when you don't know what's going on. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, look for any signs of infection, and check for vitamin deficiencies. The chest X-ray will help us determine the cause of the crackles in your lungs - whether it's fluid buildup, infection, or something else. We’ll also need to consider your history of multiple sclerosis. It's possible this is a flare-up, but given the new symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to write up the orders for the blood work and X-ray now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be able to draw the blood for you. The X-ray can be done at the imaging center across the street. They'll need a referral from me, which I'll send electronically. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, or severe weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. Blood work, X-ray, and then a follow-up appointment. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. Shortness of breath, chest pain, fever… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it's a little scary. Do you think… is this serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking, Mr. Asthore. It’s difficult to say definitively at this point without the results of the tests. The new symptoms – especially the crackles in your lungs and the worsening weakness – do warrant investigation. It's possible it's a flare-up of your multiple sclerosis, but we need to rule out other causes, such as pneumonia or heart failure. We’re taking this seriously, and that's why we're ordering these tests. It’s better to be cautious and thorough. I don't want to alarm you unnecessarily, but it’s important to be aware of the potential seriousness of these symptoms. We’ll have a clearer picture once we have the results. I'll call you as soon as they’re available to schedule the follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well. Just… try to hurry with the tests, okay? I just want to know what’s going on. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Asthore. I understand your anxiety, and I'll do my best to expedite the tests. I’ll personally follow up with the lab and imaging center to ensure they're processed quickly. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, Mr. Asthore. And again, please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
