DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, you know, keepin' up with things. Routine visit, like we talked about on the phone. I try to stay on top of it when I can.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Fornes. Routine vaccinations are certainly important. Let me just pull up your file… ah, yes. It appears we discussed tetanus, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines last time. Do you recall which ones you've already received since that last discussion?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... That was a while back, wasn't it? I think I had the flu shot last fall, definitely before the really cold weather hit. Tetanus… honestly, I can't remember for sure. I try to get 'em, but with work bein' busy, sometimes things slip my mind. Pneumococcal… that one doesn't ring a bell at all. Sorry, I wish I was better at rememberin' these things. Is there a record somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, fortunately, we do keep detailed records. Let me see… according to this, you received the influenza vaccine on October 15th of last year, so that is up to date. The last tetanus booster was… ah, September 2020. That means you are due for a tetanus booster. And it appears you’ve never received the pneumococcal vaccine. Now, Ms. Fornes, before we proceed with administering those, I do like to briefly review your medical history. It's just standard procedure. Have you had any significant changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: No, not really. Work's been pretty steady, which is good. My back's been a little achy sometimes – you know, from being on my feet all day inspectin' buildings – but that's just normal for me. No major illnesses, no new allergies… just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older, I guess! I haven't been to the hospital or anything. Everything else is pretty good, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when my back flares up. And sometimes a little something for sleep, but not every night. It’s just a herbal tea, honestly, nothing strong. Nothing the doctor prescribed. I mostly just try to rest when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, as far as you are aware?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mom always said I had a cast-iron stomach!
DOCTOR: Good. Now, Ms. Fornes, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam, just to ensure everything is as it should be before we administer the vaccines. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good to me. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please have a seat and lean forward. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… deep breath… and exhale. Good. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears appear clear. Throat is… a little dry, but no signs of infection. Now, I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes. No swelling detected. Everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Fornes. Now, we can proceed with the vaccinations. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything really well. Just get it over with, I guess! I don’t love needles, but I know it’s important. Are they gonna hurt bad?
DOCTOR: They will be a slight pinch, Ms. Fornes, but it’s very brief. We use the smallest gauge needle possible to minimize discomfort. Now, we will administer the tetanus booster in one arm, and the pneumococcal vaccine in the other. Please roll up your sleeves. There you go. All done. Just a little pressure here to stop any bleeding. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection sites for a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, should help. Avoid strenuous activity with that arm for the rest of the day. Now, I will document this in your chart.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks Doctor. That wasn't too bad, actually. Sore, but not awful. Glad to have that outta the way. Should I be watchin' for anything specific besides the soreness? Like a fever or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good question. You should monitor for any signs of a severe allergic reaction, though those are rare. That would include difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, hives, or dizziness. If you experience any of those symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. A mild fever, muscle aches, or fatigue are common side effects and should resolve within 24 to 48 hours. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve after that time, please contact the clinic. Now, I will provide you with a printed summary of your vaccinations and these instructions. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been really helpful. I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fornes. It was my pleasure. Remember to stay hydrated and allow yourself some rest. If anything arises, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and stay well. .
PATIENT: .
