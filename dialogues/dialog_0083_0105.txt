DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think my wife set this up... I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. It’s… pre-surgery, right? Something about checking if I’m okay to have it?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. Your wife scheduled a pre-operative evaluation for you. It's standard procedure to ensure you’re in the best possible health before any surgery, and to discuss the risks and benefits. Don't worry about not remembering the specifics; we'll go through everything together. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you’re considering weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Well… it's just… everything's getting harder. Getting around, mostly. My knees… they bother me a lot. And I get tired really easily. It’s tough keeping up with my kids, you know? I want to be able to play with them without getting winded. My wife… she worries about my health, too. She says it's not just my knees, but… other things, I guess. I don’t really know the specifics, like I said. It feels like a lot, just… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is impacting your quality of life significantly, and it's admirable that you're taking steps to address it. It's good your wife is supportive. Let's gather some more information. First, can you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s… difficult. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the last few years. I think I had… strep throat when I was a kid? And maybe the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious, as far as I remember. I don’t know about family history, either. My family… we don’t really talk about that stuff much. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I just… don't have a good memory for those things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll work with what you do remember, and if there are gaps, we can try to fill them in. We have your basic information here, but knowing a little more about past illnesses or family health issues can be helpful. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. This would be… the first time. I’m a little nervous, honestly. I don’t really like hospitals or doctors, even for check-ups. That's probably why I don’t go much. It's… a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel anxious about surgery, especially if you haven’t had it before. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable throughout the process. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees when they’re really bothering me. That’s over-the-counter, right? And… I think my wife makes me take a multivitamin? Just a regular one, from the store. Nothing else, I don’t think. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I don’t remember ever taking anything else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain and a daily multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I've never had a really bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks me before I eat something new, just in case. She’s very careful. But, no, I don't think I have any allergies. I eat pretty much anything. Unless it tastes really bad, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies is helpful. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. My parents didn't smoke, and I never really liked the smell of it. My wife… she’s very against it, too. So, no, definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well… I drink sometimes. Mostly on weekends, with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe a beer. Nothing heavy, I don’t think. It’s… relaxing, after a long week. My wife and I, we'll share a bottle sometimes. But it's not every weekend, and I don't drink during the week. I don't get drunk or anything like that. Just… a little to unwind.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption – a glass of wine or beer on weekends. That's good to know. Now, tell me a bit about your typical diet. What does a normal day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… not great, to be honest. I work a lot of hours at the store, and sometimes it's hard to find time to cook. So… a lot of fast food, unfortunately. Burgers, fries… things like that. My wife tries to get me to eat better, but it’s tough. Breakfast is usually just coffee, maybe a piece of toast. Lunch is whatever I can grab quickly. And dinner… sometimes we cook a proper meal, but a lot of times it’s takeout. I know I should eat healthier, but it’s hard to make the time and effort. I don't really enjoy cooking, either. It feels… overwhelming. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at describing this.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're very busy, and it’s understandable that it can be difficult to prioritize healthy eating. It's good that you're aware of it, and we can certainly discuss strategies to help with that later. Let’s move on to something else. Now, I’m going to ask about your bowel movements and urination. Is there anything unusual about either of those things?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Well… I guess not, really. Everything’s pretty normal, I think. I mean, I go to the bathroom when I need to. No problems, no pain… nothing unusual. I try to drink enough water, but sometimes I forget. And… yeah, everything's regular. I'm sorry, this is… a bit personal.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. These are important questions, and I understand they can be a bit uncomfortable. Thank you for your honesty. Now, let’s talk about your physical activity level. What kinds of exercise or physical activity do you typically engage in?
PATIENT: Not much, to be honest. I walk around a lot at work, that's about it. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Now… I get tired really easily. I try to walk with my wife sometimes, but it doesn't last long. I mostly just sit or stand at work. It's not very active, I know. I wish I could do more, but... I just don't have the energy.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mostly walking at work with limited other physical activity. I understand that fatigue can be a barrier. Now, one last question for the history portion. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight – either unintentional weight gain or loss?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I’ve been gaining weight slowly, over the last few years. It’s… gradual. Not a sudden change. Just… little by little. I think my clothes have been getting tighter. I don’t know how much weight exactly, I haven't really been keeping track. It's just… noticeable. And… that's why I'm here, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kochubey. That was very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your vital signs. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90. A bit elevated. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. I’m noting that. Your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters, which puts your BMI at 36.7 – indicating obesity. Do you have any pain or discomfort anywhere right now?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my knees bother me, like I said. But right now… my stomach feels a little… uneasy. It's not really pain, more like… a dull ache. And… yeah, I guess that's why it felt tender when you touched it. It comes and goes, usually after I eat. It's not constant. It's probably just… indigestion, or something. I get it sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. A dull ache in the abdomen that comes and goes after eating. We’ll need to investigate that further. Given your symptoms and physical exam findings, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, check your liver function, and rule out any underlying conditions. I also recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… Ultrasound… Will they… hurt? And what will the blood work show? I don't like needles. I always get nervous with needles. Will it take long? I have work tomorrow...
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Kochubey, and it’s good you’re asking them. The ultrasound is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or injections. A technician will simply use a wand-like device on your abdomen to create images of your organs. It shouldn’t be painful, though you might feel some slight pressure. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the blood work, yes, it does involve a needle, but it’s a very quick procedure. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and it will only take a few minutes to draw the samples. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. We’ll have the results back within a few days. I understand your concern about needles, and we can certainly take things slow and make sure you’re comfortable. I can also see if the lab technician can draw less blood if that would ease your anxiety. Given your work schedule, we can schedule the blood work for first thing in the morning, so you can still make it to work. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: First thing in the morning… that might work. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… you can ask them to… not take too much blood? That would be good. I just… I get faint sometimes. So, ultrasound and blood work. To check my stomach and everything? And then we’ll talk about the surgery again?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Ultrasound and blood work to investigate your abdominal discomfort and assess your overall health. Then, once we have those results, we can discuss the surgery in more detail, including the risks and benefits, and whether you are a suitable candidate. We’ll take everything step-by-step. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and ultrasound. The lab and imaging center are both located nearby, and I’ll give you their contact information. They’ll schedule the appointments for you. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you… taking your time. I guess… I’ll just… wait for them to call me about the appointments? And try not to worry too much?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It's my pleasure. You've done a great job voicing your concerns, and you’re taking the right steps. Yes, just wait for the lab and imaging center to contact you to schedule the appointments. If you haven’t heard from them within a couple of days, please give us a call, and we can assist you. And try not to worry too much. We’ll work through this together. Here are the referrals, and this is the clinic’s contact information if you need anything. I wish you a good day, Mr. Kochubey. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
