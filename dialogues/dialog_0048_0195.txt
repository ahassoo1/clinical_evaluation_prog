DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Micucci. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not really sick sick, you understand. More like… a little down. My daughter, she said I should get a card from the doctor. A “get well” card, or one of those… encouraging ones. Just to cheer me up a bit, she said. It’s silly, really. But she worries.
DOCTOR: Right. A…card. Well, we do document everything here. So, “feeling down” is something we should at least note. It’s good your daughter is concerned. Can you tell me a little more about what’s making you feel this way?
PATIENT: Making me feel this way? Honestly, it’s just… life, you know? Things aren't bad, exactly. My husband, he's fine. The garden is growing. But everything feels… gray. And people nowadays… they have no respect. No manners. It just gets to you, after a while. It’s exhausting, dealing with all the… nonsense.
DOCTOR: "Gray"...and dealing with "nonsense." I see. And how long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Months, certainly. Maybe even… a year? It comes and goes, you know? Some days are better than others. But it’s always there, lurking in the background. It’s not like a fever, where you can pinpoint when it started. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific happened in the last year that might have contributed to this feeling?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… well, young people these days, they don't visit enough. My grandson, he lives in the city, always busy with his… computer. And the price of tomatoes went up again. Honestly, it’s outrageous! You try growing your own when your back isn't what it used to be. It’s the little things, really. Not one big event, just… everything. It’s draining.
DOCTOR: Right. So, feeling overwhelmed by…daily stressors. And a lack of social visits. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep is… sleep is fine. I always sleep well, thank goodness for that. A good eight hours, usually. Appetite… well, I don’t eat as much as I used to, perhaps. Not because I don't want to, you know? Just… food doesn’t taste the same anymore. Everything is so bland. And I don't have the energy to cook anything fancy. Simple things only. Rice and lentils, mostly.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite, loss of taste. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like a cold? No, no. Nothing like that. Just… a general weariness, you know? A heaviness. It’s hard to explain. Like carrying a stone in your pocket all the time. It doesn't hurt, exactly. It just… is. And honestly, I don’t want to bother you with silly complaints. You have real patients with real illnesses, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Well, we take all concerns seriously here, Ms. Micucci. Just to be thorough… have you noticed any difficulty concentrating, or any feelings of hopelessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Oh, goodness no. I’m a practical woman. Hopelessness is for people who don't work hard. I concentrate fine, mostly. It’s just… remembering names is harder these days. And I get annoyed very easily. Everything just seems… irritating. Like people are deliberately trying to be difficult. Though, honestly, they probably are.
DOCTOR: Irritability, difficulty with recall… Alright. I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out anything underlying. Blood pressure, pulse… routine things. Can you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A scale? Honestly, I don’t see what that will prove, but if you insist. I haven't weighed myself in ages. It’s probably nothing, really. I just… I hope I haven't lost too much weight. It makes me feel frail, you know?
DOCTOR: 55 kilograms. That’s… a bit low for your height. And your blood pressure is 118 over 72, which is normal. Pulse is 78, also within normal limits. Respiration is normal. Lungs are clear. I’m going to order some basic blood work. Just to check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you’re feeling. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work? Honestly, all this fuss over a little… weariness? I hope it’s not too expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know. And my husband’s pension doesn’t stretch very far these days. Will it take long? I have my garden to tend to. The tomatoes won’t pick themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: The blood work will be about… $80, perhaps a little more. And it should only take about fifteen minutes. We can try to find a payment plan if needed, though it's often difficult. Take this to the lab down the hall. And then, once we have the results, we can discuss them. Perhaps some lifestyle changes or, if necessary, a referral to a specialist. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… well, will this show if I’m just… getting old? That’s what my daughter thinks, you know. She says I need to “slow down” and “enjoy life”. But what is there to enjoy, honestly? Everything is just… more difficult these days. And will it interfere with my gardening? I really need to get those tomatoes picked before they rot on the vine.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us some information, Ms. Micucci. It won’t tell us if you’re “getting old,” though frankly, some fatigue is expected with age. As for your gardening, it shouldn’t interfere. Try to rest while you wait for the results, and don’t overexert yourself. I think that’s all we can do for today. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. Do you have any allergies or medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies? No, not really. I get a little sniffly in the spring, but that’s just the pollen, you know? And medications… just a little something for my arthritis, occasionally. Ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes a herbal tea my daughter brings over. She thinks it’s good for everything, that girl. Honestly, I think it just tastes nice.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And herbal tea. I’ve documented that. I think that covers everything for now, Ms. Micucci. The lab results should be back in a few days. We'll contact you to schedule a follow-up. In the meantime, try to rest, stay hydrated, and don't overexert yourself. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… thank you, Doctor. Though I doubt it’s anything serious. It’s just… life, you know? And the tomatoes. I really must get those tomatoes picked. I think I’ll just go and check on them now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. Have a good day. And try not to worry. .
PATIENT: Yes. A good day to you too, Doctor. .
