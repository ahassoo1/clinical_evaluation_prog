DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Hernandez, is it? Yes. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need… a paper signed. Something about… fixin’ myself up a little. A fella told me I needed clearance from a doctor before I do it. Said somethin’ ‘bout bein’ safe. I don’t rightly remember all the details. It’s a cosmetic thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A form for a cosmetic procedure. No problem at all, we can definitely get that sorted out. Just to be clear, and for my records, what kind of cosmetic procedure are you looking to have done?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… don’t recall the exact name. It involves… well, it involves this here belly. It’s saggin’, see? A fella said he could… tighten it up. Some kind of… pullin’ and… suction, maybe? It’s not brain surgery, Doctor. Just a little… improvement. I don't need a whole lot of questions asked, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand you'd like to keep things brief, and I respect that. But even for a cosmetic procedure, it's important for me to get a good understanding of your overall health to ensure your safety. It's not about questioning your choices, just making sure everything is okay medically. So, let’s start with the basics. Have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Major? Look, I’ve lived sixty-four years. I’ve had… aches and pains. A little arthritis, maybe. Nothing a good liniment couldn't fix. I ain’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I ain’t one for complainin’. You think I got time for sickness? I work with towers, Doctor. Radio waves and all. Important work. No time for sniffles and… whatever else folks go to doctors for.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical problems that you're aware of. Arthritis, some aches and pains, and you work with radio towers. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I had… somethin’ done with my teeth, a long time ago. A root canal, maybe? Or was it a filling? I honestly can’t recall. It was… decades ago. And I think… maybe a mole removed from my back once. But that was years and years ago too. Small thing. Didn’t bother me much.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible root canal or filling, and a mole removed from your back, both a long time ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat just about anything. I ain’t a fussy eater. And I don’t take pills. Never have. Don’t believe in ‘em. A little whiskey now and then, that’s all. And that don't bother me none. I haven’t had a reaction to… nothin’, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you don't regularly take any medications. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: I just told you! I don’t take pills! What part of that didn’t you understand? Look, I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And it ain’t regular. I eat good, I work hard, and I don’t need all those fancy… supplements. It's just common sense. Can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, I hear you. No regular medications, occasional aspirin. Just confirming to be thorough. Now, quickly, any family history of serious medical problems?
PATIENT: Family… Now there's a question. My mama… she lived to be old. Real old. But I don't recall what she died of. Probably just wore out, you know? My daddy… he worked in the steel mills. Strong man. He… had a cough, towards the end. But again, details are… foggy. We weren’t ones for talkin’ about sickness. Bad luck, they said.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother lived to be old, cause of death unknown, and your father had a cough towards the end of his life. I understand the details are unclear. Alright. Let's talk a little bit about your current health. You mentioned working with radio towers. Is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Demanding? Doctor, it’s essential work. You think them cell phones work by themselves? I climb those towers. Fix the antennas. Make sure everything’s runnin’ smooth. It ain’t easy. But I’m strong for my age. I gotta be. I still do most of the clmbin’ myself. Though, I get a little winded sometimes. And my back… well, it complains a bit. But that’s just part of the job. It's worth it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so physically demanding work, some shortness of breath, and back pain. And you said you get winded sometimes. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your back pain on an average day?
PATIENT: Hmm… Ten is… broken, right? I ain't never been broken. On a good day? Maybe a three. A dull ache. But when I’ve been climbin’ all day? Or if I bend over wrong? It can get to… a six, maybe seven. Not enough to stop me, mind you. Just… unpleasant. I rub some liniment on it, and it usually calms down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a three to seven, depending on activity, and liniment helps. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't one for bein' poked and prodded. But… if you gotta. Just be quick about it. I got things to do. And don't go stickin' needles in me, you hear? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. Just a quick listen and a look. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90 – a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a bit of fullness… some excess weight, naturally. No tenderness to the touch, though. Now, given your history and the brief exam, it sounds like you are generally healthy, but we need to address that elevated blood pressure. It's important to monitor that. Also, the cosmetic procedure you’re planning involves… abdominal contouring, correct?
PATIENT: Contourin’? Is that what they call it? Look, I just want my belly tightened up. That’s all. I ain’t askin’ for a miracle, just… a little help. And blood pressure… I always been a little… high-strung. It runs in the family. I told you, my mama… And I ain’t one for sittin’ around worryin’ about numbers. So can we just get this form signed? I got a appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. But before I sign anything, I need to be clear. This procedure does carry some risks, especially with elevated blood pressure. There's a risk of complications, like bleeding, infection, and poor wound healing. I’m willing to sign the form to say you’re medically cleared for consideration of the procedure, but I strongly recommend you see a specialist – a vascular surgeon or a qualified plastic surgeon – for a thorough evaluation. They can assess your risk factors and determine if you’re a good candidate. I can give you some referrals. And I really think you should get your blood pressure under control before proceeding. We can discuss lifestyle modifications, or I can prescribe medication if necessary. What do you think?
PATIENT: Specialists? Medication? Look, Doctor, I ain't got time for all this. I just want a signature. I've lived sixty-four years without all this fuss. I'm a grown man, I can make my own decisions. I don’t need a whole lot of tellin' what to do. Just sign the paper, and let me get on with my life. I’ll take the risk. I always do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand your position. However, I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your safety. I will sign the form, but with a very clear disclaimer stating that you were advised of the risks associated with the procedure given your elevated blood pressure, and that you declined further evaluation and treatment recommendations. Here you go. Please read the disclaimer carefully. And I truly urge you to reconsider seeing a specialist. I'm providing you with some referral information just in case. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t need nothin'. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I got things to do.
DOCTOR: .
