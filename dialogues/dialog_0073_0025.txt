DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Laury Scobie, that’s me. Well… I want to know more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear now you can… test things? To see where your ancestors are from? Like, with spit or something?
DOCTOR: Ancestry testing… Yes, I’ve heard of it. It's becoming quite popular. However, this isn't typically something we offer here at the clinic. We focus on your current medical needs, Mr. Scobie. But… I suppose it’s important to understand your background, if it's concerning you. Are you experiencing any health problems that you believe might be related to your family's origins?
PATIENT: No, no health problems. Not really. Just… curious. Always been curious. My grandfather, he tell stories of the islands, but old man stories, you know? Hard to remember everything. I just thought… maybe this test can show me? Show me where I really from. Like a picture of my family long ago? Does it do that?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t quite work like that, Mr. Scobie. It analyzes your DNA, which can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins – percentages, generally. It won’t give you pictures, or a complete family history, unfortunately. More of a… broad overview. While I appreciate your curiosity, and it’s good to be interested in your heritage, this isn't really a medical issue. I would recommend speaking with a genealogist or looking into reputable ancestry testing companies. I can perhaps give you a referral to a local resource, but I wouldn't want to give you false hope about what they can provide. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Not pictures, huh? That's… okay, I guess. Just thought it sounded good on the TV. A referral would be nice, Doctor. If you have something. I don't know where to start looking. I mostly just… make little boats. Wood boats. Not good with computers and all that. Medicare… will it pay for this referral? I don't have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: A referral to a genealogist wouldn’t typically be covered by Medicare, Mr. Scobie. It’s considered a personal service, not a medical necessity. However, I can give you a list of local resources – some may offer free initial consultations or have lower fees. I'll have the receptionist print that for you. While we’re discussing your well-being, and since you’re here today, let’s focus on your current health status. You mentioned making boats… is that your primary activity?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly boats. Keeps my hands busy. I used to fish, a long time ago, but… hard to get out there now. Old bones, you know? Not much pain, but… slow. I eat okay, mostly fish and rice. My neighbor, Mrs. Taito, she brings me some taro sometimes. She's a good woman. Is this test… expensive? The spit test? Just wondering. Even if I can’t get a picture. Maybe just to see… a little bit of where I come from?
DOCTOR: The at-home ancestry tests can range quite a bit in price, Mr. Scobie, from perhaps $100 to several hundred dollars, depending on the company and the level of detail they provide. I really wouldn't want you spending money on something that may not provide the information you’re hoping for, or that is scientifically… questionable at times. Let's talk about something more concrete. You say you eat fish and rice, and your neighbor provides taro. That sounds reasonably healthy. Are you having any difficulty with your digestion?
PATIENT: No trouble with my tummy. Everything goes down okay. Maybe a little slow sometimes, but that's just old age. Like the boats, you know? Slow to build. Slow to move. But… if I did want to try this test, what company would you… not recommend? If there's a bad one? Just so I don’t give them my money. Even if the pictures are not real. It's just… important to know where you come from. Like knowing who your family is, even the ones you never met.
DOCTOR: Honestly, Mr. Scobie, I don't follow the specifics of these companies closely enough to make a definitive recommendation or a strong discouragement. There’s been a lot of… debate about their accuracy and data privacy. I would suggest doing some research online – look for independent reviews, and be cautious of any overly optimistic claims. Frankly, I'm concerned you’re focusing on something that isn't directly impacting your health. Let's shift our attention back to you. You mentioned “slow to build” and “slow to move.” Are you experiencing any weakness or stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I will look on the… the computer. Mrs. Taito, she helps me with that sometimes. She's good with computers. Yes, my hands… they get stiff in the morning. Hard to hold the little tools. And my knees… they ache sometimes, especially when it rains. Old man things, I guess. But… I still build the boats. Slow, but I still do it. Like a good island man, always making something. But... is there something Doctor? For the hands? Or the knees? Not needing anything fancy, just... a little help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stiffness in the hands and aching knees… that’s something we can address. It sounds like you may be experiencing some mild osteoarthritis, which is very common at your age. We don't want to dismiss it as "old age." There are several options. First, let's rule out anything more serious. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam – just a simple check of your joints, range of motion, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. A quick look is good. I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. Just… see what's going on. Maybe some cream for the hands? Mrs. Taito says cream is good for everything. She's a very wise woman. But... if it's not cream... what else? A little pill maybe? Not wanting anything strong, just a little help to build the boats. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat here on the table. We'll start with your hands. I'll gently assess the range of motion and look for any swelling or tenderness. Alright, just relax your hands for me… and can you open and close them a few times?
PATIENT: There. Like this. A little stiff, you see? Especially in the morning. Hard to hold the little carving tools. Used to be easy, a long time ago. Now… I have to take breaks. Old man things. But I still build them. Every little boat has a story, you know. Every one.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There’s some crepitus – a slight grating sensation – which is common with osteoarthritis. And some tenderness on the base of the thumb. Now, let's move onto your knees. Can you bend your knees for me, as comfortably as possible?
PATIENT: There. Like that. A little ache in the front. Worse when it rains, you see? Mrs. Taito says it's the weather. She's always right about the weather. But... it's okay. I still walk to the store. Slow, but I still go. I need fish, you know. For the boats. And for me. But... does this mean I have to stop building them? Is that what you’re going to say?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, it absolutely does not mean you have to stop building your boats. That’s not what I’m going to say. It simply means we need to manage the pain and stiffness so you can continue doing the things you enjoy. Based on the physical exam, it appears you have mild osteoarthritis in both your hands and knees. We can explore a few options – over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, topical creams as your neighbor suggested, and physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints. We could also discuss a referral to a rheumatologist if your symptoms worsen. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Not wanting anything too strong, you see? Just a little help. Cream sounds nice. And maybe some pills if the rain is bad. Physical… therapy? What's that? Does it involve poking and prodding? I don't like a lot of poking and prodding. But I like building the boats. Always have. Always will. But… if the cream and pills don't work… maybe I will see this doctor? The one with the long name? If I have to. But... I want to keep building. That's all. Every little boat has a story. And I need to finish them.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Scobie. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. It’s not about poking and prodding, but gentle movement and stretching. We can start with some simple exercises you can do at home, and then we can refer you to a therapist if you’d like. For now, let's start with a trial of over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label, and a topical cream for the pain. I'll write you a prescription for a stronger topical cream, just in case. We'll reassess in a month to see how you're doing. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect. Cream and pills, and maybe some gentle stretches. I can do gentle stretches. And I will see Mrs. Taito about the computer. Maybe she can find me pictures of the islands. But… if the boats start to hurt too much… I will see this other doctor. The one with the long name. But for now… cream and pills. And I will keep building. Every little boat has a story, you know. Thank you, Doctor. You are a very kind woman. Now… about this referral… to the genealogist? Just in case. Maybe. After the boats.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm glad we could come up with a plan. I'll print you a list of local resources for genealogy, and the prescription for the stronger topical cream. Remember, focus on your well-being and enjoy your boat building. If you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Scobie. And please, keep building those boats.
PATIENT: .
