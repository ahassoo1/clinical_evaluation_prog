DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Ashlie? My husband, he make appointment for me. For… the place for old people? He say I need paper from doctor to go there. The senior… living place. I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Ashlie is… acceptable, I suppose. Though, Ms. Abdollahi, it’s generally best to use formal titles. However, we can discuss that later. You are seeking documentation for admission to an assisted living facility, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Assisted… yes! That is what my husband say. He worry I need help now. I feel good, mostly. But he say better to be ready. He do all the work, I just come here. Is okay with you? You think I okay for the place?
DOCTOR: Well, “okay” is a rather subjective term. We need to assess your current health status to determine the appropriate level of care, should you require it. Let’s start with a brief medical history. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: Hmm… a primary… doctor? I go to the clinic in town when I sick. Is Doctor Ramirez, but I don’t see him much. Mostly just for the cold, you know? My husband, he take me when I need. I don’t… have a regular doctor, maybe? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Abdollahi. Regular preventative care is important, even – and perhaps especially – as we age. But we can work with that. Have you been hospitalized for any reason in the past?
PATIENT: Hospital? Oh… long time ago. When my son, he born. Is very difficult, very long time. And… maybe when I break my arm when I fall in the garden. But is many years ago. Not sick, not for long time. Just the fall, and the baby. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: And have you undergone any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… I have… they take out my gallbladder, many years ago. And… when I have the baby, they cut me, of course. But that is all, I think. Maybe I forget, but I don't feel like I have more surgeries. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my blood pressure. The doctor, Doctor Ramirez, he give me. Is a small white one. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, when my knee bother me, I take something for the pain. But not every day. Is just when I need. The red one, I think.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. My husband, he say I eat too much, but I don't get sick! No problems with food, and I never have problems with medicine. I don't think. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but that is all. Nothing serious. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family? My mama, she have problems with her heart. She get very sick when she old. And my papa, he have… the sugar sickness, the diabetes. He lose his leg. Is not good. And my sister, she have trouble with her memory. But that is all I remember. Is long time ago.
DOCTOR: And finally, could you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… history? I live with my husband, he is very good man. We have three children, they all grown up now. They visit sometimes. I like to garden, and cook. I go to church on Sunday. I don’t… I don’t go out much anymore. Is that what you mean? I mostly stay home now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, to properly assess your suitability for assisted living, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. My husband say you are very good. Is okay. Just… be gentle, please? My bones, they are not so strong anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your vital signs. Please sit back and relax. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur present, but likely benign. Lungs are clear, but you have a somewhat diminished breath sound on the left lower lobe. We may need a chest x-ray to investigate that further. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present. Reflexes are diminished, as expected with age. Range of motion is limited, particularly in your knees. You also have some mild swelling in your ankles. Your gait is somewhat unsteady, and you appear to have some difficulty with balance. I recommend a referral to physical therapy for a comprehensive assessment.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is everything okay? My knees are always bothering me, and my ankles swell when it is hot. The doctor, Doctor Ramirez, he say it is just old age. Is the balance bad? I fall once last year, but nothing broken. Physical… what did you say? For the… the moving? I just want to be safe, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Physical therapy, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s not merely “for the moving.” It’s to strengthen your muscles, improve your balance, and reduce your risk of falls. And while some degree of decline is expected with age, we need to ensure there aren’t any underlying medical conditions contributing to your symptoms. The fall last year is concerning. We will order some blood work to assess your overall health, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. We'll also get that chest x-ray to evaluate the diminished breath sound. And yes, I concur, a physical therapy evaluation is paramount. Based on this initial assessment, I believe you would benefit from assisted living, with appropriate support and supervision. However, these tests will help us to determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Supervision? You think I need… someone to watch me? My husband, he will be upset. He just want me to be safe, not… like a baby. I can still cook, and garden, mostly. What if the tests are bad? What if I can't live there? I don’t want to be a bother to anyone. My husband, he do everything, and I don't want to make more work for him. Is the physical therapy long? And expensive? I have insurance, but… Is everything going to be okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, let's not get ahead of ourselves. "Supervision" simply means having assistance available should you require it. It doesn’t mean you are incapable of independent living. We are gathering information to make an informed decision. As for the tests, we’ll discuss the results in detail when they come back. I can’t speculate on the findings at this stage. And regarding cost, your insurance should cover a significant portion of the physical therapy. We have a billing department that can assist you with any financial concerns. It’s important to be realistic about your physical limitations. You mentioned your knees and ankles, and you had a fall last year. These are all factors that need to be considered. Now, I'm going to write these orders and arrange for the necessary tests. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, in case we need to do any imaging?
PATIENT: Contrast… dye? No, I don’t think so. I never had any… special tests before. Just the regular check-ups with Doctor Ramirez. My husband, he always ask if I have any allergies, but I always say no. He is very careful. Is everything so serious, Doctor? I just want to go to a nice place, with other people. Not… a hospital. I just want to be happy, and not a bother to anyone. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Abdollahi, I understand your concerns. We are not attempting to frighten you. We are simply being thorough. The goal is to ensure your safety and well-being. The tests will help us determine the best course of action, and we will discuss all options with you and your husband. For now, I'm going to write these orders, and my nurse will schedule you for blood work and the chest x-ray. We will also contact a physical therapy clinic to schedule an evaluation. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your regular activities, within your limitations. And please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any changes in your condition. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Just… please be gentle. And… don’t tell my husband if everything is bad. He worry too much. He is a good man, but he… he gets scared easily. Thank you, Doctor. I just want to be okay. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to review the orders and schedule your appointments. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollalli. .
