DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… physical, right? For… the team. Yes. A physical. I… think it's for a tryout. It’s a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Old age, you know? Not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, a physical… right. For a team tryout. No problem at all. We'll get everything checked out. Just to confirm, is this a new team you're trying out for, or is this a regular check-up related to a team you’ve been with for a while?
PATIENT: A new team, I believe. Yes. Definitely new. I… don't recall ever playing with these people before. They called me, you see. Said they needed a… a strong back. That’s what they said. Strong back. Is that… normal? To be called about your back?
DOCTOR: It's… not uncommon to be recruited for a specific skill, Mr. Bartok. A strong back could be important depending on the sport. Let’s not worry about how they found you right now. We’ll focus on making sure you're physically able to participate safely. Before we begin, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… Hmm. Well, I don’t get sick much. Not like some people, always coughing and sneezing. But my knees… they bother me sometimes. And I get… winded easily. Walking up stairs, you know? It’s not… a good feeling. I used to be able to run a mile without thinking about it. Now… now it’s a struggle. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Knee pain and getting winded easily… those are good things to know. When did you start noticing the knee pain, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… Oh dear. That's a tough one. A few years, I think? Maybe five? It comes and goes. Not constant. It’s… after I do something. Lifting, you know? Or… being on my feet a long time. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. A dull ache. And the windedness… that’s been getting worse lately, I suppose. I don't pay much attention to these things, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent knee pain for about five years, worsening shortness of breath recently. Do you have any pain in your knees right now?
PATIENT: No, not at this very moment, no. Just… a little stiff, maybe. Like an old door, you know? Needs a little oil. I haven't done anything strenuous lately, so it's not bothering me too much. But I can feel it… lurking. Waiting for me to lift something heavy. It’s a… a warning sign, I think. Is that what that is? A warning sign?
DOCTOR: It very well could be, Mr. Bartok. Good that you're listening to your body. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about that years ago. Said to watch my salt intake. But I don’t remember a proper diagnosis, you see? Just… a suggestion. Nothing serious. And… no, I don’t think so. No heart problems. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to smoke, but I quit a long time ago. That was… good. Very good. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. History of possible high blood pressure, previous smoking, now quit. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None at all. Not a single pill. I don't like taking medicines if I can avoid it, you see? Always worried about the side effects. My wife… my ex-wife… she was always taking pills. It didn’t end well. So, no. Nothing. Just… a little ibuprofen now and then, for aches and pains. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, occasional ibuprofen. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think… I don't believe so. Nothing that I'm aware of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, from certain plants, but nothing serious. My ex-wife… she was allergic to everything. It was a nightmare. But me? No. I’m a pretty tough guy, you see. Don't bother much with allergies.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. My heart? Alright. Maybe it’s not as strong as it used to be, but it’s still ticking, you see? Still going. Just… a little slower, perhaps. Go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Your knees… there’s some mild tenderness on the inside of both knees, especially when you bend them. Range of motion is good, but there's some crepitus – a grinding sensation – when you move them. It’s not severe, but it’s there. Do you experience any swelling in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. Sometimes, after I’ve been on my feet all day. Not a lot, you see? Just a little puffiness. Not like a balloon or anything. Just… a little bigger than usual. It goes down when I rest them. I usually put my feet up, you see? Helps a lot. But yes, sometimes they swell. Not always. Just… when I overdo it. Does that make sense? It's a bit difficult to explain. Old age, you know. Things swell. It happens.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Intermittent swelling after activity. Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, and your blood pressure is a little high. The shortness of breath could be related to being out of shape, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an X-ray of both knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. I don't like tests, Doctor. Always worrying about the results, you see? But… alright. If you think it's necessary, go ahead. Complete blood count… basic metabolic panel… X-ray… Yes, alright. But please, don't tell me everything that's wrong, you see? Just tell me what I need to know. I don't want to worry my… well, never mind. Just do the tests.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. We’ll just focus on what’s important. I'll write up the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. The nurse will give you the instructions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have the test results. And if you experience any chest pain or significant shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm. Well… about this team, you see? Do you think… do you think I’ll be able to play? Even with… all this? Old age, you know? And the knees… and the blood pressure… Will they let me play? That’s my biggest question, I suppose. I don’t want to waste their time. Or mine.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Mr. Bartok. It’s hard to say definitively without knowing the demands of the team and the results of these tests. We need to assess your overall health and the condition of your knees. If your knees are significantly arthritic, or if you have any underlying heart condition, it might not be safe to participate in strenuous activity. We'll know more once we have the results. I’ll also recommend a consultation with a sports medicine specialist if you are interested in playing, just to get another opinion. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done and seeing what they reveal. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. Tests first, then… then we’ll see. Sports medicine specialist… alright. Another doctor. More opinions. It’s… a bit overwhelming, to be honest. But alright. I trust your judgment. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… patient.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. We'll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the X-ray. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and we’ll talk soon.
