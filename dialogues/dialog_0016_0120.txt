DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi. Look, I don’t really have time for this, but my sister insisted. She said I should… get checked out. I want to have a baby, obviously. But I don’t want any… problems. You know? I had a perfectly good husband, everything was fine before, and I just… want it to be easy this time. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's absolutely not too much to ask, Carmaleta. Planning for a healthy pregnancy is important, and it’s good you’re thinking about this now. It sounds like you’ve had a previous pregnancy, and you’re hoping for a smooth experience this time around. To help me understand what "smooth" means to you and to make sure we cover everything, can you tell me a little bit more about your previous pregnancy?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It was… fine. Normal, I guess. I don’t really… dwell on it. It was a long time ago. I had him, everything was… textbook. No complications. I just… don’t want any surprises this time, you know? My sister keeps saying things can be different, and I just… I don’t want to hear it. Is that a good enough answer? I don’t remember specifics, okay? It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like your previous pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated, and that's wonderful. And it’s completely understandable that you wouldn’t remember every detail after all this time. Since it was uncomplicated, that gives us a good starting point. To get a better understanding of your current health and make sure everything is still good to go, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I… don’t think so. I mean, I take a little something for my… blood pressure, maybe? The doctor gave it to me a while back. But honestly, I can't remember why. It's probably nothing. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. My sister worries too much, always has. Is that something we need to go into detail about? Because I really don’t have time for a long list.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the medication for your blood pressure, even if you’re not sure why it was prescribed. It is important to know, as blood pressure can affect pregnancy. Do you happen to know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Ugh. No. Absolutely not. I just… take the little pills. The doctor wrote a prescription, the pharmacy filled it. I don’t memorize everything! Honestly, I just want to know if I can get pregnant without a whole lot of… fuss. Is that too much to ask? Can’t you just tell me if I need a special diet or something? I don’t want to be poked and prodded and given a million tests. My sister said you were thorough… maybe too thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It sounds like you're feeling anxious about a lot of testing and just want reassurance. I assure you, I don't want to put you through anything unnecessary. We can start with a basic check-up and see what's needed. Knowing the name of the blood pressure medication would help me assess your risk, but we can work around that if you don't recall it. Before we move on, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I… I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad, but that's just normal, right? Everyone gets that. I don’t break out in hives or anything dramatic. I definitely don’t have any serious allergies. Honestly, this is all so… tedious. Can we just… move on to the part where you tell me what I need to do to get pregnant? I have a lunch date, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known serious allergies, that's good. And I appreciate you telling me about the pollen sensitivity. It's helpful to know everything. Since you mentioned wanting to know what you need to do to get pregnant, let's talk about pre-conception health. Before we talk about any specific steps, can you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Ugh. Cycles? Honestly, they're… irregular. They always have been. Sometimes they’re close together, sometimes they’re… not. I haven’t really kept track. It’s never been a problem before. I just… know when it's happening. And then it's over. My sister tried to get me to use an app, but I just… don’t have time for that. It's all so… complicated. Can't you just give me a pill?
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular cycles. That's definitely something we need to explore a bit further, as it can impact getting pregnant. I understand you don't want to track things with an app, and that's perfectly fine. But roughly, how often do you have a period?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? I have no idea. Like… every few months? Sometimes it's shorter, sometimes it's longer. It really depends. I'm busy, okay? I don't sit around counting days. Look, is there a quick test we can do? Just to tell me if everything's… working? My sister said you have all sorts of fancy machines… Can we just skip to that part? I really, really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta, I understand your frustration and that you're feeling pressed for time. A blood test is a good next step. It can give us information about your hormone levels and overall health. Before we order that, let's quickly go over some basic lifestyle factors. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, no. Absolutely not. I had a husband, okay? I don't do those things. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And definitely not while trying to get pregnant! Honestly, I just want to get this over with. Can we please order the test now? I have a lunch date and I'm already late. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no recreational drugs, and very limited alcohol. That’s good to know. Alright, let’s get that blood test ordered. It will check your hormone levels, blood count, and a few other things. I’ll need to get some basic information from you for the lab, like your date of birth and insurance details. Do you mind if I quickly access your EHR to confirm that information?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it done. My date of birth is… August 15th, 1982. And my insurance is… Priority Gold. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want a baby, not a medical history lesson. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m confirming your date of birth as August 15th, 1982, and your insurance as Priority Gold. Perfect. I'm now sending the order to the lab. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. Here's a copy of the lab slip for your records. It also has the lab's phone number. While we're waiting for those results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I just want the results. And I want to know if I need to do anything special. Like, take vitamins or… avoid certain foods. Honestly, this whole thing is just… stressful. Can I just… go now? I really, really need to go. Is there anything else? Please tell me there’s nothing else. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Carmaleta. I understand you’re feeling stressed and need to get to your lunch date. I've noted your concerns. I'll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they're available, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, it’s generally a good idea to start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid, even before you get pregnant. It helps prevent birth defects. You're welcome to call the office if you have any questions. Have a good day and enjoy your lunch.
