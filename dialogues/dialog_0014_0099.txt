DOCTOR: Alright, Denis. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Osterholm. It’s good to meet you. I received a letter regarding the results of a test… a test of my insides, I believe? The one where they sent the little camera down. It said there were some… abnormalities. I’m a bit worried, naturally.
DOCTOR: Yes, the endoscopy results. Right. "Abnormalities" is… a strong word. People get worked up over the smallest things. Let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s usually nothing serious. Now, can you tell me exactly what the letter said?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. You’re quite right to caution against panic. It’s just… difficult to read these things on your own. Let me see… it says here, “Mild inflammation in the distal duodenum, with several small polypoid lesions observed.” And… something about needing further evaluation? It doesn't explain what that means, exactly. I'm not very good with these medical terms.
DOCTOR: Duodenum… that’s part of your small intestine. Inflammation just means it’s a little irritated. And polyps… well, most people have them. They're like tiny growths. Often harmless. But "further evaluation"… that means they want to take a closer look. Have you had any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Well, I have been experiencing some discomfort, yes. Not pain, exactly, but a sort of… queasiness. It comes and goes, mostly after I eat. And… my appetite hasn’t been quite the same lately. I’ve lost a little weight, perhaps. Nothing dramatic, but noticeable. Also, I've had some… changes in my bowel habits, if you don't mind me mentioning. A bit looser than usual, sometimes. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Queasiness, appetite loss, weight loss…and changes in bowel habits. Alright. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I’d say it began, properly, about three months ago. At first, it was just the occasional feeling of fullness, a little indigestion. I didn’t think much of it. But over the last month, it’s become more consistent. The queasiness is almost daily now, and the changes… well, they’ve been occurring for the past few weeks, as I said. It’s been…gradual, but definitely noticeable. I’m a bit worried it might be something serious, but I try not to dwell on it. My husband… he passed away last year, you see, and I’m trying to remain strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. And past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been generally quite healthy, if I may say so myself. I’ve never had any major illnesses or surgeries. I did have a bout of… shingles, several years ago, but that was easily treated. Otherwise, just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing significant. I’ve always been careful with my diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I walk every morning, to keep active. My husband always said I was a very… robust woman. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, perhaps five years? Just for a routine check-up. Everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Any family history of… digestive issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Let me see. My mother… she suffered from rather bad indigestion, yes. She always complained of stomach upset. But she didn’t go to the doctor much, either. She just… tolerated it. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young. I don’t recall any specific digestive problems on his side. My siblings… my brother is still alive, and he seems perfectly healthy. He lives in Oaxaca, you see, and I haven’t seen him in quite some time. I'm afraid I don't know much about their medical history. We don't talk about such things often.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t take any medications at all. Never have, if I can help it. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. And no allergies, either. Not to food, not to anything. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. I used to help my grandmother with her herbal garden, you see, and I learned a great deal about plants and their properties. She always said a healthy diet and a peaceful mind were the best medicines of all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please let me know if you require anything further. I trust your expertise implicitly.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds, though a bit…hypoactive. Some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, never. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I never partook. And smoking… that’s simply unthinkable. It’s so detrimental to one’s health, you see. I believe in moderation in all things, and I strive to live a clean and healthy lifestyle. It's important, especially as one gets older.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and the endoscopy findings, I'm suspecting a possible mild case of duodenitis, possibly exacerbated by some… subtle dietary intolerance. It's not serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a stool test to check for any infections and a complete blood count to check for anemia. Also, I’m going to recommend a trial of a bland diet for a week. No spicy foods, no caffeine, no alcohol, no dairy. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds quite manageable. A bland diet… no problem at all. I’m accustomed to simple, wholesome foods, as I mentioned. I used to prepare all the meals for my husband, and I’m quite skilled in the kitchen. No dairy, no caffeine… easily done. A stool test… well, that’s a little…unpleasant, perhaps, but I understand it’s necessary. And a complete blood count… I suppose that involves a needle? I’m not particularly fond of needles, but I’ll do whatever you deem best. I trust your judgement implicitly. When would I be able to get these tests done? And where?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall. You can go right after this appointment and the nurse will take care of it. The results will take a few days. In the meantime, stick to the bland diet and see if your symptoms improve. If they don’t, or if they worsen, call the office immediately. I'm also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in two weeks, just to check on your progress. Any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. No, I believe that answers all my questions. You’ve been very thorough and I appreciate your patience. It’s reassuring to have a plan of action, even if it’s just a trial diet for now. I will go to the lab immediately and follow your instructions to the letter. I hope it is nothing serious, but I am glad to be taking steps to address it. And thank you again for your time and expertise. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any particular signs I should watch out for while I'm on the diet?
DOCTOR: If you experience any severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, persistent vomiting, or a high fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just monitor your symptoms and let me know how you're feeling in two weeks. And try not to worry. It's probably just a minor irritation. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I will be vigilant and monitor my symptoms closely. I will keep the emergency room in mind. Thank you again for your time and your reassuring words. I appreciate your expertise and your kindness. Have a good day to you as well, Doctor Osterholm. .
