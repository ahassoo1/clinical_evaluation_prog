DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Nice to meet you. As if I wanted to be here. It’s this foot. Been botherin’ me for weeks now. A sore, really. A bad one. And it just won’t heal. I've had… well, let's just say I've had a lot of experience with feet in my time, and this one’s a doozy. It’s this diabetes, you know. Everything takes longer to fix when you’ve got that hangin’ over your head.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Diabetes can certainly complicate things. Okay, so it’s a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for weeks and isn’t healing. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? It hurts! It's right here, on my heel. It started as just a little… irritation, I suppose. Now it’s… well, it’s open. And it’s angry-lookin’. Red, and… I don’t know, just unhappy. And it smells. Don’t think I need to elaborate on that part. I keep it covered, mostly, but it’s no use. It just gets worse. I’ve tried everything, you know. Everything the nurses told me when my husband was… well. Never mind that now. It’s just… stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's on your heel, started as irritation, is now open, red, and… concerning, with some odor. And you've tried some home remedies, things you learned from when your husband was ill. Can you tell me specifically what you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Home remedies. Honestly, the things people suggest! Well, I've been washin’ it, like they always say. With soap and water. And I tried some of that… iodine stuff. Brown stuff. Smelled awful, but they said it helps. Didn’t do a thing. Then Mrs. Eliana, bless her heart, told me to soak it in Epsom salts. That felt nice for about five minutes, then it just hurt worse. And I even tried a little bit of honey. You read about that on the internet now, don't you? Supposed to be good for everything. That just made it sticky and attracted flies. Honestly, I’m beginnin’ to think it’s hopless. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Alright. So soap and water, iodine, Epsom salts, and honey… none of those have provided much relief, and they may have even made things worse. Thank you for letting me know. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or red streaks coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, no. Not a fever. I've always run a little warm, you know, but nothing… alarming. Chills, no. And red streaks… let me see… Well, there is a little redness around the edges. But I always have a little redness. My circulation isn't what it used to be. And honestly, it’s hard to tell with this skin. It's not like when you're young, everything is so… clear. I don’t know if that’s a new redness. It’s probably just the normal redness. I'm tellin' you, this foot is a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some redness around the edges, which you’re unsure if it’s new. I understand your concern about the circulation. To get a better look, and to properly assess this, would you mind if I take a quick look at the foot myself?
PATIENT: Assess it? Humph. As if I don’t know what’s wrong with it. Fine. Go ahead. But don't expect miracles. And be gentle, alright? This isn't a young man's foot anymore. And don’t go pokin’ around too much. I can feel everything, you know. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I see the sore here on your heel. It’s approximately… one and a half centimeters in diameter. There is some surrounding redness, as you mentioned, and some drainage. The skin is dry and fragile. I’m also going to check the pulses in your foot to assess the circulation. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished. I’m also going to do a quick neurological exam just to make sure there isn’t any nerve damage. Could you tell me if you can feel this?
PATIENT: Diminished? Diminished?! Of course they're diminished! I’m eighty-nine years old! What did you expect, a rushing river? And now you want to poke at it again? What are you doin’ now? Is that one of those… pin things? Don't you dare stick me with a pin! I'll have you know I have a very low tolerance for… Aah! That’s cold! What was that? Can you just tell me what’s wrong with it instead of poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Cannington. I didn’t mean to cause you any discomfort. I was just trying to assess the sensation in your foot. It appears there may be some mild neuropathy, which is common with diabetes. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed, it looks like you have a diabetic foot ulcer. The reduced circulation and neuropathy make these ulcers slow to heal, and they are prone to infection. We need to take this seriously. I’d like to order some lab work to check for infection, and I think a referral to a podiatrist is the best course of action. They specialize in foot care and can provide more specialized treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Infection? Oh, great. Just what I needed. Another specialist. Honestly, these doctors just love sendin’ you around in circles. Podiatrist… is that one of those fancy foot doctors? What kind of treatment are we talkin’ about? I don’t want any of those… surgeries. I've seen enough of those in my time. And what about this lab work? What are they going to do, take all my blood? I don’t like needles. You know, my husband… never mind. Just tell me what this podiatrist does, alright? And how much is all of this going to cost? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington. A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in the care of the feet. They can debride the wound – that means remove any dead or infected tissue – apply special dressings to promote healing, and assess the blood flow to your foot. They can also prescribe antibiotics if there is an infection. The lab work will involve a simple blood draw to check your white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection, and your blood sugar levels. It's standard procedure. As for the cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the podiatrist visit and the lab work, but there may be a co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. I can have the clinic’s billing department contact you with more specific information about your potential out-of-pocket costs. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule a referral to a podiatrist for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead and schedule it. But I’m not makin' any promises. I’ve had bad experiences with specialists before. And make sure they understand I don’t want any surgeries. And get that billing department to call me right away. I want to know exactly how much this is going to cost before they start pokin’ around. Honestly, it’s enough to give a person a headache. What’s the podiatrist’s name, at least? And where are they located? Rural, you said? That doesn't sound promising. I don't want to be drivin' all over creation.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've scheduled you an appointment with Dr. Elina Kahananui. She's a podiatrist located here in the clinic, actually, so you won't have to drive anywhere. She specializes in diabetic foot care and is very experienced. I'll also make a note in your chart about your preference to avoid surgery. I'll have the billing department contact you within 24 hours to discuss potential costs. In the meantime, please continue to keep the wound clean and dry, and avoid putting pressure on your foot as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Elina Kahananui… haven't heard of her. Well, as long as she's here in the clinic, that’s somethin’, I suppose. Keep it clean and dry… easy for you to say. It's a constant battle, let me tell you. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just get me that billing information, and I’ll try not to worry too much. Although, honestly, with this foot, worryin’ is all I can do. Alright. I suppose that’s all. Thank you… Doctor. Maybe this Kahananui woman can work some magic. We’ll see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I’ve made a note for the billing department, and I hope Dr. Kahananui can provide some relief. I’ll also have a nurse check on you before you leave to make sure you're feeling alright. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and try to rest your foot. .
