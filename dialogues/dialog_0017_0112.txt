DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I am Dr. Blim. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been… going to the bathroom a lot. More often than usual, I think. It’s just… frequent. Is that a good way to put it? I apologize, I don’t really remember exactly when it started, but it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Frequent… yes. A rather vague description, I must say. Let's try to be more precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re quite right. I apologize again. It’s… hard to keep track of things, sometimes. Let me think. During the day, I’d say… probably every couple of hours? And then… maybe two or three times during the night? It’s disrupting my sleep, a little. I don't recall if it's always been this way, or if it's a recent change, though. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Two to three times during the night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's... unsettling. I wake up needing to go. It isn’t a large amount each time, thankfully, but it’s enough to… well, enough to make me tired during the day. Is that… normal? I truly don’t know what’s considered normal anymore. I haven’t been feeling unwell otherwise, if that helps. No pain, no fever… just the frequent urination.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. MacVittie. The fact that you're waking up multiple times a night is… concerning. Have you noticed any change in your fluid intake?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Um… I don’t think so? I drink water throughout the day, as one should, I suppose. Maybe a little more coffee than usual lately? Work has been… stressful. I don't actively try to drink more or less water, if that makes sense. I just drink when I’m thirsty. I really can’t say if it’s a significant change, honestly. I wish I kept better track of these things.
DOCTOR: Stress, coffee… these are all factors, of course. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No pain at all. And no burning sensation, either. It’s just… the frequency. It happens without any discomfort. It’s… just inconvenient and exhausting, to be honest. Is it possible it’s just… a phase? Or something related to the stress I mentioned? I apologize for not being more informative. It’s difficult to recall details, even when I try.
DOCTOR: A "phase" is unlikely, given the nocturnal frequency. We will need to conduct a simple urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. MacVittie. I'll have the nurse prepare a sample cup. Then, we can discuss your medical history. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, a urinalysis… yes, of course. That sounds sensible. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, Doctor. Not to food, medications, or anything else I can recall. I had a penicillin reaction as a child, perhaps? But it was so long ago, I’m not entirely certain. It was a mild rash, I think. Nothing serious. And I haven’t had any medications recently. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches. Would you like me to list any previous illnesses I can remember?
DOCTOR: Childhood reactions are rarely relevant. And headaches… a rather common ailment. Let’s focus on anything significant. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with any of those things. I’ve generally been quite healthy, all my life, I think. My mother had… arthritis, I believe? And my father… he had heart problems, later in life. But I haven’t experienced anything similar myself. I’ve never had any issues with my kidneys, as far as I know. I did have… a rather severe bout of the flu a few years ago, but I recovered fully. I hope that’s helpful. It’s difficult to remember everything. Would a list of past surgeries be useful?
DOCTOR: Surgeries are pertinent. But first, let’s address your family history a little more precisely. Did either of your parents have any urinary issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… I believe my father did, yes. He… he used to get up a lot during the night, as well. I seem to recall him mentioning difficulty emptying his bladder sometimes, but he didn’t talk about it much. It was… considered a bit of an embarrassing topic, I think. I don’t know if it was the same as what I’m experiencing, but… he definitely had trouble with his bladder. As for my mother, I don't recall any such issues. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. My memory isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, concerning your own history... Have you ever experienced any sexually transmitted infections, or had any significant pelvic pain?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That's… a personal question, Doctor. I… I was divorced a few years ago. And… yes, there were some issues during the marriage. I’m hesitant to discuss the details, truthfully. And no, I haven't had any sexually transmitted infections, to my knowledge. As for pelvic pain, I experienced some discomfort after the birth of my son, many years ago, but it resolved on its own. It wasn’t a persistent issue. I apologize for my… vagueness. I’m not accustomed to discussing these things in such detail. Would knowing about my son's health be helpful?
DOCTOR: Your son's health is irrelevant at this time, Ms. MacVittie. We are focusing on your condition. Now, let us move on to a physical examination. I will need to assess your abdomen and perform a quick neurological check. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. As you wish. . A physical examination… yes, of course. I will do my best to cooperate. It’s just… I’m a little nervous, truthfully. I don’t usually have much cause to visit doctors. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do or any discomfort I should expect. I hope I’m not being difficult.
DOCTOR: Please relax, Ms. MacVittie. I will start by palpating your abdomen. Let me know if you experience any tenderness. No acute tenderness noted. Your abdomen is soft and non-distended. Now, I will check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Let me listen to your lower back, please. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Overall neurological function appears intact.
PATIENT: I’m trying to relax, Doctor. It’s just… it feels a little strange, being examined like this. Your assessment sounds… reassuring, though. No acute tenderness… that’s good to hear. And normal reflexes… yes. Is there anything else you need to check? I apologize if I’m being uncooperative. I'm simply not used to these procedures. It's a little unsettling, truthfully. It makes me feel… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. MacVittie. The physical examination did not reveal any obvious abnormalities. However, we still need to analyze your urine sample to rule out an infection. The nurse will be in shortly to collect it. Once we have the results, we can formulate a more definitive plan. In the meantime, I recommend you reduce your caffeine intake and try to stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Reduce caffeine… and stay hydrated. Yes, that sounds sensible. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. I’m simply… relieved to hear that nothing obvious was found. I appreciate your thorough assessment. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse, then? And… thank you, again. I feel a little less anxious now. It’s comforting to know we’re taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. MacVittie. I’ll have the nurse come in momentarily. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they are available. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. .
PATIENT: .
