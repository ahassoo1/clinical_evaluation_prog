DOCTOR: Right. Teah Fornes, 53. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Memmolo. Just for my shots, you know? Routine stuff. Gotta keep up with those, I guess. My husband reminded me it was time.
DOCTOR: "Shots," right. Well, we should verify what you’ve had and what you need. It’s not just a matter of “keeping up,” you know. Some of these things have schedules, and some… well, some you might not even need anymore. Let's start with the basics. Do you recall which shots your husband was referring to?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, not really. He just said “time for your boosters” or something like that. I don’t keep track of all that stuff. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe from when I had them last? I get them… whenever the health fair comes to town, usually. Or when I see a doctor, which isn’t often, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A health fair… Right. Well, that’s… not ideal record-keeping. Let me pull up whatever’s in the system. Hmm. Limited information. It appears you had a tetanus booster… seven years ago. And a flu shot last season. That’s… about it. Do you have any allergies to vaccines?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with a shot before. I mean, I don’t like them, nobody does, but I haven’t ever had a reaction or anything. Just a little sore arm, usually. Is that all you need to know for now?
DOCTOR: "A little sore arm" is hardly a comprehensive medical history, Ms. Fornes. But… alright. Do you have any underlying health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh! Good point. I do have… well, my joints ache sometimes. Especially in the cold. My grandma had arthritis, so I figure it’s probably that. Nothing a doctor’s ever really looked at, though. I just take some over-the-counter pain relief when it gets bad. And I’m a little… heavy, maybe? I used to be lighter, but things change as you get older, you know?
DOCTOR: "Aches" and "maybe heavy." Wonderful. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just…tired sometimes. But who isn’t? I work pretty hard, you know, inspecting buildings. It's a physical job. And I try to help out around the house when I can. I sleep okay, eat… well, pretty normal. Nothing that stands out, I don't think. Honestly, I just want to make sure I'm up-to-date on everything so I don’t get sick and slow things down at work. My crew depends on me.
DOCTOR: Right. "Crew depends on you." Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your lungs… the usual. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Hope you don’t mind, I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I might be a little rusty with all this.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, 148 over 92. Pulse is 78. Lungs are clear, but you do have a slightly rapid respiratory rate. Abdomen is soft. Weight is 114 pounds, height 169 centimeters. BMI is… low. Very low, actually. You said you’re eating normally?
PATIENT: Low? That’s… surprising. I mean, I’m not big, never have been. But I eat… I eat like a normal person! Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Maybe not huge portions, but… I don’t skip meals or anything. Maybe I’ve just lost weight without noticing? Work’s been stressful lately… could be that. I do sometimes forget to eat if I get really busy. Is that bad? I really don’t think I’m unhealthy.
DOCTOR: "Forgetting to eat" and a BMI of 19.7... that’s concerning, Ms. Fornes. We need to discuss this further. Are you experiencing any fatigue, dizziness, or weakness?
PATIENT: Oh… 19.7? I didn’t even know what that meant. I just figured I was… petite. Okay, now that you mention it, I have been feeling tired a lot lately. And a little lightheaded sometimes, especially when I stand up quickly. I just figured it was from being on my feet all day. You think it's something serious? I really don’t have time to be sick, Dr. Memmolo.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fornes. We'll need to run some blood tests to investigate this further. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… just to rule out any underlying issues. And given your weight, we should also consider a nutritional assessment. I’m going to order these tests immediately. The nurse will draw the samples before you leave.
PATIENT: Okay. Tests… alright. That sounds… thorough. I guess that’s good. I trust your judgment, Dr. Memmolo. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again? I really hope it’s nothing serious. I have a building inspection scheduled next week, and I can’t afford to miss it.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 3-5 business days. We’ll call you with the results. And yes, you will likely need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to prioritize eating regular, nutritious meals, even when you're busy. And if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe dizziness, weakness, or fainting—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, regular meals… I’ll try. Emergency room… that sounds scary. Um… what kind of things should I be eating? You said nutritious, but… what does that even mean? I usually just grab whatever’s quick and easy. Sandwiches, soup… things like that. Should I be taking vitamins? I always forget to ask these things. And… will the tests tell us why I'm so tired? That’s the main thing, really. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: "Normal." Right. Look, Ms. Fornes, I’m a doctor, not a nutritionist. But try to incorporate more protein and complex carbohydrates into your diet. Lean meats, fruits, vegetables, whole grains. And yes, a multivitamin wouldn't hurt, but it’s not a substitute for proper nutrition. As for your fatigue, the tests will help us identify any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing. Anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies… We’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, let's get these blood tests ordered. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay… protein, fruits, vegetables… I’ll try. Sounds like a lot of work. Alright, I guess I'll just wait for the nurse then. Thank you, Dr. Memmolo. .
