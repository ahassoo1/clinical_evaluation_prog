DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, really. Some health forms... for, uh… well, just to get them official, you know? Notary stuff, I guess. I'm hoping it won't take too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can definitely get those forms signed for you. Just to be clear, are these forms related to a specific program or service you’re applying for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not really a program, no. It’s… complicated. My niece, she’s helping me get some assistance. I'm not insured, and she found something that might help with the bills. These forms are just… part of it. She said I needed them notarized by a doctor. Does that make any sense? I don’t understand half of what she tells me, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Melvenia. It’s not uncommon for assistance programs to require documentation like this, often with a notary’s signature. Just so I can be sure I’m signing off on everything appropriately, could you tell me what kind of assistance your niece is helping you apply for?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the foggiest. She just handed me the papers and said, "Auntie, you need this signed!" She does all the research and filling out… I just provide the information when she asks for it. It has something to do with… help with medical costs, I think? She said it’s a new program that just started. She's very good with computers, that girl. I wouldn’t know where to begin. Is it alright if I just hand you the forms? Maybe you can see what they are and if you can sign them.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. Please, hand them over. Before I sign, I do need to confirm that I have a basic understanding of what these forms are for. It’s important for my medical record and to ensure I’m acting in your best interest. It’s also important to quickly review your medical history before signing anything. Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your health, just to be on the safe side?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not at all. Ask away. I don't have much of a history, to be honest. I've been pretty lucky. Just getting old now, that’s all. No major illnesses or anything. Fire away, Doctor. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I appreciate your patience. According to my records, you're Melvenia Tippens, age 76. Just to confirm, you identify as Mexican, and your height is listed as 189 centimeters and your weight as 110 pounds. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that sounds right. Yes, that's me. Though I haven't been measured in years, I guess. 189 centimeters... that’s awfully tall, isn’t it? I’m not that tall! But if the computer says so… I suppose it’s right. And yes, I’m Mexican, born and raised. And 110 pounds… give or take a few, after a good meal, maybe. But yes, that sounds right. Can we get to the signing now, Doctor? My niece is expecting these back today.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Just one moment. It looks like there's no existing medical history documented here, so I do want to ask a few quick questions, just to be thorough. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no chronic conditions. Not a one. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. . High blood pressure, maybe when my niece tells me how much things cost these days! But nothing a doctor has ever told me about. I used to walk a lot, but my knees… well, we already talked about those. Just getting old, that’s all. Can we please get to the papers now? I'm starting to get a little anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. Just a few more quick questions, then we'll get to the forms. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And no hospital stays, thank goodness. Not even for a broken bone. I was a clumsy child, mind you, but always managed to escape without a trip to the hospital. Just a few scrapes and bruises here and there. I really think I'm the healthiest 76-year-old you'll meet today. . Can we see the papers now, Doctor? I'm really starting to worry about my niece. She gets very upset when things don't go smoothly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. These forms appear to be for the County Medical Assistance Program. They seem pretty straightforward. Just to be completely thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, usually. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, a little Vitamin D in the winter, but that's about it. Nothing a doctor prescribed, if that matters. Can we get this over with now, please? I really appreciate your patience, Doctor. This is taking a very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And Vitamin D occasionally. Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not a one. I eat everything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Really, I'm a very simple person. I eat healthy, I take a little ibuprofen when I need it, and I’ve been pretty lucky with my health. Can we please sign the papers now? I'm getting very anxious. And my niece is probably wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. It appears there’s no medical reason preventing me from signing these forms. Here you go. I've signed and dated them for you. Please let me know if you have any questions. I recommend establishing a primary care physician if you don’t already have one, so you can have regular checkups and address any health concerns promptly. Do you have a primary care doctor currently?
PATIENT: Oh, bless you, Doctor! Thank you so much! . That's wonderful! No, I don’t have a primary care doctor. Never really needed one, to be honest. Just go to the urgent care when I have a cold or something. But I'll think about it, Doctor. I promise. Can I go now? I really need to get these to my niece. She's probably frantic! Thank you again, you’ve been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Melvenia. You have a good day. And please, if you experience any changes in your health, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And do consider establishing care with a primary care physician. .
