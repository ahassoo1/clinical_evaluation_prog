DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s about my eyes, really. They’ve been… sensitive to the light. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's getting a bit bothersome, to be honest. Makes things difficult, especially with the sun being so bright lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, light sensitivity, or photophobia, as we call it. And you said “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, hmm… maybe three or four months now? It started gradually, just noticing things were a bit brighter than usual, you know? I didn't think much of it at first, just figured I was tired. But it’s definitely gotten worse. Like, even inside with the lights on, sometimes it feels too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months of gradually worsening light sensitivity, even indoors. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: It's not really pain, Doctor. More like… discomfort. Like my eyes are straining, and everything feels washed out, even when it’s not that bright. And sometimes I get a bit of a headache with it, right behind my eyes. It’s hard to explain… it's like they’re tired even when I’ve had enough sleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Discomfort, straining sensation, washed-out vision, and headaches behind the eyes. We'll definitely investigate that. Have you noticed any changes in your vision other than the sensitivity to light?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, I don’t think so. Everything looks clear enough, as far as I can tell. No blurriness, no double vision, nothing like that. Just the brightness bothering me. I did notice, a couple of times, like little floaters, you know, those spots that drift across your vision? But I've always had those from time to time, so I didn't think much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in clarity, just the light sensitivity and those occasional floaters you've experienced before. Have you had any other symptoms at all – maybe dry eyes, redness, or any discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my eyes feel a little dry, yeah. Especially in the evenings. I usually just blink a bit more, and it seems to help. No redness that I’ve noticed, and definitely no discharge. I haven’t been rubbing my eyes more than usual, if that makes a difference. It’s mostly just the light and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dry eyes, but no redness or discharge, and you haven't been rubbing your eyes more. Let's talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Not really. I was pretty healthy, all my life, to be honest. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox and all that, but nothing serious. Nothing a doctor ever needed to keep track of. Oh, wait… I did have a bout of really bad flu a couple of years ago, but that's it. And, of course, my wife… but that wasn't a medical thing for me, if you understand. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No significant medical history, just typical childhood illnesses and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. And no family history of eye problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. My mum had bad knees, but nothing with her eyes. And my dad… he wore glasses when he got older, just for reading, I think. But he didn’t have any problems with sensitivity to light or anything like that. As far as I know, everyone on both sides of the family had pretty good eyesight. It’s just me being… difficult, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of eye problems. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. Just a multivitamin, every now and then, if I remember. And sometimes I take a painkiller for a headache, but nothing regularly. Just when I really need it. I don’t take anything prescribed by a doctor, though. I haven't needed to, thankfully. And my wife... she had a few things, but that was years ago and not anything I take.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional multivitamin and painkillers as needed. No regular medications. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with that, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, I don’t take much medication, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. It’s just these eyes now…
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful, Arbin. No allergies, no significant medical history, and no regular medications. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's causing this, if we can. It's just a bit worrying, you know? Especially with everything else...
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your concern. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity – how well you can see at different distances. Then, I'll examine your pupils and their reaction to light, check your peripheral vision, and finally, I’ll take a look inside your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. I'll also check the pressure inside your eyes. It's a standard procedure and shouldn't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any point. Could you please sit up straight and look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, no problem. Straight ahead, you said? I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. And thank you... for taking the time to listen. It helps just to be able to talk about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It’s my job to listen. Okay, I’m going to show you this chart. Please read the smallest line you can see on it. Cover one eye with your hand, if you will, and read the letters from left to right. Don't worry if you can’t see them all. Just tell me what you can see. We’ll start with your right eye.
PATIENT: Okay, right eye. Let me see… um… I can see the top letter, the big E… and the next one… is that a J? Yes, definitely a J. And… hmm… I can make out… the next line… it’s a little blurry… um… that's a C… and… that's an O. But after that, it gets really fuzzy. I can’t really make out the smaller letters. They’re just… blobs.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. So, you can clearly see the large E and J, and you can make out the C and O, but the smaller letters are blurry. Now, let’s try your left eye. Cover your right eye with your hand, and read the letters again.
PATIENT: Okay, covering my right eye now. Let me see… um… it's about the same, I think. I can see the big E and the J clearly. And… yes, the C and O. But the smaller letters are blurry… just like my right eye. I can't really read any past those. It's all a bit… washed out. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Alright, your visual acuity is roughly the same in both eyes – you can read down to the line with the C and O, but the smaller letters are blurry. That suggests a refractive error – something that can be corrected with glasses or contacts. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I’m going to ask you to focus your gaze on this point here, and I’ll show you some lights in your peripheral vision. Please tell me when you see a light appear.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Focus on the point… And tell you when I see a light. Sounds good. I'll do my best. It's a bit strange trying to look around my focus point, though. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal. It takes a bit of practice to focus on the central point while detecting lights in your periphery. Okay, I'm starting now. Just tell me "yes" when you see a light, regardless of color or brightness. ...Do you see a light now?
PATIENT: Yes!… I see a light… on the… left side. Just now. A small one… a little faint, but I saw it. Do you need me to say anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now?
PATIENT: Yes! … On the right side, now. A bit brighter than the last one, I think. Definitely saw that one. It's a bit hard to concentrate, though. Everything feels… fuzzy around the edges. I hope I’m not messing it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin, you’re doing fine. Just keep focusing on this point and let me know when you see a light. ...Do you see a light now?
PATIENT: No… no light. Not yet. Still nothing… Just darkness around the edges. I’m trying really hard, Doctor. It’s just… difficult to see anything out of the corner of my eye.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now?
PATIENT: No… still nothing. I think… I think my vision is getting a little blurry now, actually. Even looking straight ahead. Is that normal? I'm starting to feel a bit… uncomfortable. It's just… a lot to focus on. I apologize if I’m making this difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin, that's alright. It seems like this test is causing you some discomfort, and your vision is becoming blurry. We’ll stop the peripheral vision test here. Let's move on to examining your pupils and then looking inside your eyes. That’s a quick process. I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupil response. It won’t hurt, but it may be bright. Please try to relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Shine the light… I’ll try to relax. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. And thank you… for being patient with me, Doctor. I really appreciate it. It’s just… a lot to deal with sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course. Okay, your pupils are reacting to light normally. They constrict when I shine the light in and dilate when I remove it. Now, I’m going to use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to look inside your eyes – at your retina and optic nerve. This will allow me to see if there are any abnormalities. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't hurt.
PATIENT: Okay, look inside… I’ll try to stay still. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. And thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to do all this. It helps just to know… what's going on, if you can find anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. This may take a moment. Okay, I’ve examined both eyes. The retinas appear normal – no signs of bleeding or damage. The optic nerves look healthy as well. I don't see any obvious abnormalities at this point. However, given your symptoms – the light sensitivity, the blurry vision, and your history of flu – I think it's prudent to check your blood pressure just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Check my blood pressure… that sounds sensible. Anything to rule things out. That's good… to be thorough. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you thinking of everything. Just let me know what you find, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly. It’s within an acceptable range, but it's something to keep an eye on. Given all of the information - your symptoms, the examination findings, and your blood pressure reading - my preliminary assessment is that you may be experiencing a viral conjunctivitis or possibly a mild case of uveitis, which is inflammation inside the eye. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count and an inflammatory marker test will give us more information. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds good. If it will help figure out what’s going on, definitely. Viral conjunctivitis… or uveitis… I’ve never heard of those before. Are they… serious? And what kind of treatment would I need if that's what it is? Just let me know what I need to do, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay. Conjunctivitis is usually not serious – it's an inflammation of the membrane that covers the white part of your eye. It's often caused by a virus and typically resolves on its own within a week or two with supportive care – things like cool compresses and artificial tears. Uveitis, however, can be more serious, but it’s also treatable. It’s an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye. If it’s confirmed, we'll need to start you on anti-inflammatory eye drops to prevent any long-term complications. I'll write you a referral to the lab for the blood tests, and I'll give you a prescription for some artificial tears to help relieve your symptoms in the meantime. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay… viral conjunctivitis… uveitis… artificial tears… a follow-up appointment… I think… I think I understand. So, the blood tests will tell us which one it is, and then we'll know what to do? And the artificial tears are just to help with the dryness in the meantime? Just… is there anything I should be doing now? Like, avoiding bright light, or wearing sunglasses, or anything like that? And thank you… for explaining everything so clearly. It helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The blood tests will help us determine the cause and guide the treatment. And the artificial tears are just to provide some relief from the discomfort in the meantime. Regarding what you can do now, yes. Avoiding bright light is a good idea, and wearing sunglasses is highly recommended, especially outdoors. You can also apply a cool compress to your eyes for 10-15 minutes several times a day. And try to avoid rubbing your eyes, as that can worsen the inflammation. I'll also give you a handout with more information about these conditions and some helpful tips for managing your symptoms. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay… avoiding bright light, sunglasses, cool compresses, and no rubbing my eyes. I can do that. And the handout… that's good. I like having something to refer to. No… I think that's everything, Doctor. I’m just… relieved to finally have some answers, or at least a plan. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. You’ve been very kind. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to support you. I'll have the lab referral and the prescription ready for you at the front desk. And here’s the handout with information about viral conjunctivitis and uveitis. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. I will. Bye bye.
