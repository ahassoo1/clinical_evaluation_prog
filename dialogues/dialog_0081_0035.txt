DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good while now, actually. Not constantly, you understand, but they come and go, and they’re getting a bit tiresome. It’s funny, isn’t it? You don’t think much of a hiccup, but when they just won’t stop…
DOCTOR: A “good while,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Started… let me think… around the beginning of July, I’d say. Maybe the tenth? Around then. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, you know. I was visiting my daughter, Leilani, in Suva, and I think it started then. Not right in Suva, though, more on the drive back to my place. It wasn't bothering me much at first, just a few here and there. But now… they’re more frequent, and sometimes they come in little bursts. Like that.
DOCTOR: Suva, you say. Interesting. And these hiccups… do they seem to be related to anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question, Doctor. I’ve been trying to figure that out myself! Not that I can tell, really. I haven't been eating anything unusual. I drink my usual hibiscus tea, maybe a little extra when it's hot. I haven't been overly stressed, not any more than usual, anyway. Leilani always says I worry too much about the grandchildren, but that’s just a grandmother’s job, isn’t it? No, I can't think of anything that sets them off, specifically. They just… happen.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed anything else accompanying these hiccups?
PATIENT: Accompanying them…? Well, let me think. No, nothing really bad. Sometimes, when they’re really bad, I get a little bit of a stomach ache, just a mild one. And maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but I do get that sometimes anyway, you know, with the tea. Oh! And I do feel a little breathless after a long bout, just because I’m trying not to cough when they happen. But that’s all, really. Nothing alarming, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Let's review your medical history. I see you have a record of mild hypertension, managed with hydrochlorothiazide, and occasional GERD. Any changes to your medications recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's right. The blood pressure and a little bit of tummy trouble now and then. No, no changes to the medication, Doctor. I get my prescriptions filled at the same place, every month, same dosage. Old Mr. Sharma knows me by name, bless him. He always asks about my garden. Everything's been regular as clockwork.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter remedies, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else, Doctor. Just the one little pill for my blood pressure. I do like a little ginger sometimes when my tummy feels a bit off, but that's not a regular thing, and it’s just a tiny piece of fresh ginger, you know? Not those fancy ginger capsules or anything. Just a little bit of root, chewed up. I try to keep things simple, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Well, nothing serious. I get a bit of a sniffle when the frangipani are blooming, but that's just a little bit of a runny nose, nothing that needs any medicine. And I used to be allergic to mangoes as a child, but I haven’t had a reaction to them in years, so I think I grew out of that. Nothing that would cause any trouble with hiccups, I wouldn’t think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a listen to your chest and check your abdomen, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little bit of pressure, maybe, but nothing painful. It’s just a bit… tender, I suppose, right around my belly button. But that's probably just from eating too much cassava, isn't it? I do love my cassava. Ooh, a little bit there, on the left side, just under my ribs. But it's not a sharp pain, just a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Mild tenderness, as you say. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though a bit…hypoactive. And your weight is listed as 99 kilograms. Have you experienced any recent weight changes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my weight. I suppose I haven’t noticed any change, really. I always weigh around the same, bless my heart. I do like my food, you know. My daughter, Leilani, is always telling me to watch my portions, but I’ve always been a bit…sturdy, let’s say. It’s the Fijian build, I think. I haven’t been feeling any thinner, or fatter, just the same as always.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief physical exam, it's unlikely this is anything immediately serious. However, given the persistence of the hiccups and the mild abdominal tenderness, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound just to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. If it puts my mind at ease, I’m happy to have those tests. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know when and where I need to go for them. I do hope it’s nothing too serious, though. I do enjoy my life, and I'd like to keep enjoying it, hiccups and all!
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll get those ordered for you right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is across the street. I'll have the nurse give you the requisitions and instructions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and large meals. We'll review the results when they come back, and if the hiccups persist, we can discuss further options, potentially a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. No fizzy drinks, and smaller plates – I can manage that. And if you think a specialist is needed, then I’ll trust your advice. Thank you for taking such good care of me. It’s a relief to know someone is looking into this. I really do appreciate it. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Or any specific questions you have for me that I haven't answered yet?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe so. Just try to relax and eat a light meal before the ultrasound, if possible. The nurse will provide detailed instructions. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. I don’t think there’s anything further at this time. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything beautifully. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this checked out. You’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for your time and patience. I’ll see the nurse now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor. Thank you again. .
