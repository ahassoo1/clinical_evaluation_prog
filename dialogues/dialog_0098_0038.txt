DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Honestly, I… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I understand I requested something… a form? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should things come to that. I believe it has to do with future medical care, but the details are rather… hazy. It was suggested to me, and I wanted to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, I see. You're referring to an advance directive – sometimes called a living will or healthcare proxy. It’s very thoughtful of you to plan ahead like this. It can be a bit overwhelming with all the legal terminology. Don’t worry about the “hazy” details. We can go through everything step-by-step. Before we dive into that, though, just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about why you felt it was important to establish this now?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. It is a bit… unsettling, to be frank. I suppose… a few months ago, I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu. It wasn't the flu itself, but… the feeling of being so utterly helpless, so reliant on others… it frightened me. And then a friend of mine… her mother was very ill, and the family struggled to agree on what she would have wanted. I simply don’t want to put my loved ones in that position. I'm divorced, you see, and… my family is quite distant. It's mostly just me. That may sound… bleak. I apologize. But it spurred me to action, I suppose. I just want to make things easier, should the need arise.
DOCTOR: No, not bleak at all, Evann. It's incredibly responsible and proactive of you to think this through. It’s far more difficult dealing with these situations without having a clear understanding of someone’s wishes. You’re doing the right thing. And it’s perfectly valid to feel frightened by those experiences. Being helpless is never easy. Let’s start with your medical history, then. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring to hear. My medical history… hmm. I've generally been quite healthy, thankfully. As a child, I had the usual things – measles, chickenpox – but nothing serious. When I was younger, I broke my wrist – a silly fall while horseback riding, if I recall correctly. And… oh, about ten years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. It was quite painful, but the recovery was relatively smooth. Otherwise… nothing major. I try to eat well, though I do enjoy a good pastry from time to time. I suppose that’s a vice. I’ve never been a smoker, and I only drink socially. Does that… suffice? I worry I’m not being very helpful, with my poor memory.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Evann, thank you. It’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And don’t worry about the memory – it’s completely normal to forget details, especially when discussing past events. The important thing is you’re sharing what you do recall. Now, regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin daily, just a standard one. And occasionally, when my joints ache – and they do, with the weather – I take ibuprofen. Nothing regular, though. Perhaps two or three times a month, depending on the humidity. Oh! And I use a retinol cream at night for my skin. Is that… relevant? It’s hardly a medication, I suppose. I sometimes take a herbal tea for sleep, chamomile I believe, but that’s only when I’m particularly stressed. I believe that covers everything. It's rather mundane, isn't it? I hardly seem like a patient at all.
DOCTOR: Not at all mundane, Evann. It’s important for me to have a complete picture, and this is all very helpful. Knowing about the ibuprofen, even occasional use, is important. And the retinol cream is good to note as well. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. And I enjoy most foods, though I’m not particularly fond of shellfish. But that’s a preference, not an allergy, I don’t think. I've been stung by bees a few times as a child, but nothing severe – just a bit of swelling and discomfort. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, thankfully. I do get hay fever in the spring, but that’s just sneezing and a runny nose. Is that… the kind of allergy you mean? It’s rather mild. Again, I apologize for being so vague. I feel like I’m failing this test miserably.
DOCTOR: You are not failing any test, Evann! This isn't a test; it's simply gathering information to ensure I can provide you with the best possible care. The hay fever is good to know. And no need to apologize for being vague – memories can be tricky. Now, before we move on to discussing your preferences for your advance directive, let’s quickly touch on your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a difficult question. As I mentioned, my family is rather distant. I haven’t seen most of them in years. My mother… she suffered from high blood pressure, I believe. And she had arthritis, quite badly towards the end of her life. My father… he had heart problems, I think. But honestly, I don’t know the specifics. I wasn’t very close to either of them, and medical matters were rarely discussed. I believe my grandmother on my mother’s side had diabetes, but again, that’s just a vague recollection. It’s not much, is it? I wish I had more information, but… it simply isn't available to me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. It's not always possible to have complete information about family history, and it's perfectly reasonable that you don't. We can proceed without it. Now, I’d like to understand a little more about your overall health and lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… I try to. I enjoy walking, when the weather permits. I live in a rather pleasant neighborhood, and I take a walk most days, if I’m not too busy with my work. Etching can be quite physically demanding, you see – a lot of fine motor skills and precise movements. It keeps me active, in a way. I used to ride horses regularly, but that was years ago. I don’t have the time or the facilities for it now. I suppose walking is my main form of exercise. I wouldn't call myself an athlete, certainly. More of a… leisurely stroller.
DOCTOR: "Leisurely stroller" – I like that! Walking is excellent exercise, and etching certainly sounds physically demanding in its own way. And finally, do you use tobacco or alcohol?
PATIENT: Certainly not tobacco, Doctor. Never. And alcohol… only socially. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, or a celebratory drink on special occasions. I don't drink regularly, and I certainly don't drink to excess. It’s not a habit, you see. More of a… social lubricant, perhaps. A very occasional one. I find I prefer tea, honestly. Much more calming.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Evann. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, if you're comfortable, let’s move on to discussing your advance directive. We can talk about what it is, what it covers, and what your preferences are. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible. I confess, I’m still rather unclear on the specifics. Perhaps you could explain it to me, in plain language? I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I truly want to do this properly, but my mind doesn’t seem to hold onto details as well as it used to. I just want to be sure my wishes are respected, should the need arise.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Let's start with the basics. An advance directive is a legal document that allows you to make your wishes known about your medical care if you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s essentially you telling us what you want – or don’t want – if you were in a situation where you couldn’t communicate your decisions. There are two main parts to it. The first is a living will. That outlines the types of medical treatments you would or wouldn't want in specific situations, like if you were in a coma, or had a life-threatening illness. For example, you can state whether you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops, or if you want to be kept alive on a ventilator. The second part is a healthcare proxy, also known as a durable power of attorney for healthcare. This is where you name someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A living will… stating my preferences, and a healthcare proxy… naming someone to make decisions for me. It sounds… quite comprehensive. It’s a little overwhelming, to be honest, thinking about those situations. Resuscitation, ventilators… it’s rather morbid. But I understand the importance of it, of course. So, the living will is about what I want, and the healthcare proxy is about who decides if I can’t? Is that a fair way to put it? And… is it possible to have both? Or do I have to choose one or the other?
DOCTOR: That's a perfect way to put it, Evann. You’ve got it exactly right. And yes, it is absolutely possible – and generally recommended – to have both. The living will outlines your wishes, and the healthcare proxy ensures those wishes are followed, even if the situation is complex or unclear. Having both provides the most comprehensive protection. Your healthcare proxy would be guided by your living will, but they also have the flexibility to make decisions in situations that aren’t specifically covered in the document. Now, before we dive into the specifics of your wishes, do you have someone in mind who you would trust to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. As I mentioned, my family is quite distant. I don’t have particularly close relationships with any of them. I have a few friends, but… I wouldn’t want to burden them with such a responsibility. It’s a rather… weighty decision, to have control over someone’s life. To be honest, I haven’t really thought about it. I suppose I was hoping… perhaps you could suggest someone? Someone within the clinic, perhaps? A nurse, or another doctor I could trust? I realize that’s probably… unusual. But I simply don’t have anyone immediately in mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Evann. It’s not unusual at all to struggle with that decision, and it’s better to take your time and find someone you truly trust. And while we can offer suggestions, legally, your healthcare proxy cannot be someone employed by the clinic. It creates a potential conflict of interest. However, I can certainly offer some guidance. It's important to choose someone who knows you well, understands your values, and is comfortable advocating for your wishes, even if they disagree with them. It also needs to be someone who could remain calm under pressure. Perhaps you could think about a close friend, even if they don't live nearby?
PATIENT: A close friend… hmm. There was… Anya. We used to work together, years ago. She was a librarian, a very sensible woman. We haven’t spoken in a while, though. Perhaps ten years? I’m not sure. She always was very… grounded, very practical. But I don’t know if she would be willing. And I haven’t been in touch with her for so long… it feels rather… presumptuous to ask her now, after all this time. I suppose I could try to find her contact information, but… it feels like a long shot. And what if she refuses? Then I’m back where I started. It’s all so… complicated.
DOCTOR: It is complicated, Evann, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It's perfectly reasonable to feel hesitant about asking someone you haven’t spoken to in a while. However, it’s also worth considering that she might be very touched that you thought of her, and willing to help. We don't have to make a decision right now. Perhaps you can take some time to think about it, and if you're comfortable, I can give you some resources to help you find her contact information. In the meantime, we can start discussing your preferences for your living will. That way, even if you haven't found a healthcare proxy yet, we'll have a clear understanding of what you want. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much more manageable. Focusing on the living will first, outlining my preferences… that feels less daunting. I suppose knowing what I want is a good starting point, regardless of who makes the decisions. Perhaps we could start with… resuscitation? I confess, I haven’t given it much thought. What exactly does that entail? And under what circumstances would it be necessary? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I’m simply trying to understand everything properly.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary at all, Evann. That’s exactly what I’m here for. Let's talk about resuscitation, also known as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. Essentially, it’s a procedure used to revive someone whose heart has stopped beating or who has stopped breathing. It involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to circulate blood and oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. In many cases, it can be life-saving. However, it’s also a physically demanding procedure, and it doesn’t always work. And even if it's successful, it can sometimes cause broken ribs or other complications. When it comes to advance directives, you have a few options. You can choose to have full resuscitation, meaning you want everything done to try to revive you, even if the chances of success are low. Or, you can choose to have limited resuscitation, meaning you only want certain measures taken. And, you can choose to have no resuscitation at all, meaning you don’t want any attempts made to revive you if your heart stops. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Full, limited, or none… It’s rather… stark, isn’t it? Choosing to have nothing done… that feels… unsettling. But I understand the logic of it, of course. If the chances of success are low, and it would only cause further suffering… I suppose… I’ve always believed in quality of life. If I were to be left in a vegetative state, unable to communicate or care for myself… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially. So, perhaps… limited resuscitation would be the best option? But what constitutes “limited”? What measures would that include, and what measures would it exclude? I’m afraid I’m getting lost in the details again.
DOCTOR: You’re not getting lost in the details at all, Evann. These are important considerations, and it’s good that you’re thinking them through so carefully. When we talk about “limited resuscitation,” it generally means you would want measures taken to try to restore your breathing and circulation, like chest compressions and rescue breaths. However, you might not want more aggressive interventions, like mechanical ventilation – a breathing machine – or advanced life support measures, like electric shock to restart your heart. It also depends on your overall prognosis – your likely outcome. If you had a serious underlying medical condition, or if your chances of recovery were very low, you might choose to forgo more aggressive interventions. We can document your preferences very specifically. For example, you could state that you want CPR if your heart stops suddenly, but you don't want to be put on a ventilator. Or, you could state that you only want certain life-sustaining treatments if you have a reasonable chance of recovery. Would you like me to explain the options in more detail, or would you prefer to talk about another aspect of your advance directive?
PATIENT: Perhaps… perhaps we should talk about the other aspects first? The ventilation sounds… frightening. And I confess, I’m not sure I understand the implications of it. What would it entail, and what would it mean for my quality of life? I suppose it’s best to address my fears one at a time, rather than getting overwhelmed with the details. If you wouldn't mind, could we talk about the healthcare proxy again? Perhaps thinking about who would make those decisions for me would help me clarify my own preferences. It feels… counterintuitive, but perhaps it's worth a try.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Evann. It's perfectly okay to take things one step at a time, and addressing your concerns one at a time is a good way to approach this. And you're right, thinking about your healthcare proxy can help clarify your own preferences. Let's revisit that then. You mentioned Anya, a former coworker. What do you remember about her personality and values?
PATIENT: Anya… she was a very grounded woman. Very practical, very sensible. She was a librarian, you see, so she was always well-informed and logical. She wasn’t one for emotional outbursts or impulsive decisions. She always thought things through carefully, weighing the pros and cons before making a choice. She was also very compassionate, very empathetic. She genuinely cared about people, and she always tried to do what was best for them. She was also… very independent. She didn’t rely on anyone else, and she always stood up for what she believed in. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, even if it meant going against the grain. I suppose… if I had to describe her in one word, I would say… reliable. She was always there for you, always willing to help. I remember one time, my apartment flooded, and she spent the entire weekend helping me salvage my belongings. She didn’t ask for anything in return. She just… wanted to help.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Evann. “Reliable,” “grounded,” “independent,” “compassionate” – those are all excellent qualities in a healthcare proxy. It sounds like she’s someone you truly trust, and someone who would advocate for your wishes even if they disagreed with them. Given her personality and values, do you think she would be comfortable making difficult medical decisions on your behalf?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I suppose… it's been a long time since I’ve spoken to her. I don’t know what her life is like now. She might be overwhelmed with her own responsibilities. She might not want to take on such a burden. But… knowing her, I think she would feel a sense of obligation. She always felt a responsibility to help others, and she wouldn’t want to let me down. She might not be comfortable with it, but I think she would do it anyway, out of a sense of duty. I suppose… it's worth a try, isn't it? Even if she refuses, at least I would know I did everything I could. And if she agrees… well, I think she would be an excellent healthcare proxy. She’s the only person I can think of who I truly trust to make those decisions for me.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful assessment, Evann. It sounds like she’s definitely worth reaching out to. And you’re right, even if she’s unable to take on the responsibility, you’ll have peace of mind knowing you explored all your options. Would you like me to provide you with some resources to help you find her contact information?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. I don’t even know where to begin. I suppose I could try social media, but… I’m not very tech-savvy. Any assistance you could offer would be greatly appreciated. Perhaps a directory, or a website that might have her listed?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a list of resources that might help you find Anya. There’s a website called WhitePages.com, which is a people search directory. There’s also a social media search tool called Pipl, which can help you find people across multiple platforms. And finally, there’s a local library directory, which might have her listed if she’s still working at the same library. I’ve also included a link to a website called the National Library Association, which might have a directory of librarians. I understand you’re not very tech-savvy, so if you’re having trouble using any of these resources, feel free to come back and ask for assistance. We have a few volunteers who are very good with technology and would be happy to help you. Would you like me to provide you with any other information at this time?
PATIENT: That’s… incredibly kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. This is more than I could have hoped for. I think this is a good starting point. I’ll try these resources and see if I can find her contact information. No, I don’t think I need anything else at the moment. Unless… perhaps you could recommend a good herbal tea for anxiety? I confess, I’ve been feeling rather stressed lately, with all of this. But that’s probably irrelevant. Thank you again for your patience and assistance. I feel much more… prepared now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. And yes, a good herbal tea for anxiety is perfectly relevant. I often recommend chamomile or lavender tea. Both have calming properties and can help reduce stress and promote relaxation. Peppermint tea can also be helpful, as it can soothe digestive issues that often accompany anxiety. There are also some excellent resources online about herbal remedies for anxiety. I can provide you with a link if you’re interested. But most importantly, remember to take care of yourself. This is a big step, and it’s okay to feel stressed. Don’t hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a therapist if you’re struggling. I’m very pleased with your progress today. Please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment if you have any questions or concerns in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you, Evann. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Bombara. Thank you again for everything. . .
