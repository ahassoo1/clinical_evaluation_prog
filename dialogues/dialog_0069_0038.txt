DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. I believe I’m here regarding some… forms. Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? It was suggested I obtain one. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and the details are… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It's very responsible of you to be thinking about this, and it's common for details to feel a bit overwhelming. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both important documents for outlining your wishes regarding your future medical care. Let's start with a little bit of background. I see here you're 35 years old. Are you currently experiencing any health concerns that prompted this discussion, or is this more of a proactive measure?
PATIENT: Proactive, I believe. Though… it’s difficult to say precisely why I initiated this. I recall a conversation… with someone. Perhaps a friend? It’s very fragmented. No specific health concerns at the moment, no. Just… a feeling that it would be prudent to have these things in order. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s… frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Evann. Fragmented memories can be incredibly frustrating, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We can absolutely proceed without a clear recollection of the initiating event. To help me understand what would be most useful for you, could you tell me a little about your overall health history?
PATIENT: Overall health… I’ve generally been… well. I haven’t required much medical attention, thankfully. No major illnesses or surgeries. I do have… a sensitivity to certain metals, I believe. It causes a rash, but it's easily managed. And… I had a divorce a few years ago. I don’t know if that’s relevant. It was… amicable, I suppose. I have private insurance, if that's helpful. Other than that… I’m afraid I’m drawing a blank. I work as an etcher and engraver, which… keeps me quite still for long periods. Perhaps that’s of note?
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. No major illnesses or surgeries is good to hear. And noting the metal sensitivity is important – we’ll add that to your allergy list. The divorce… while not directly medical, it's good to have a complete picture, so thank you for mentioning it. And the nature of your work – being still for long periods – that's good to know as well; we’ll keep that in mind when discussing your overall well-being. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but very infrequently. Perhaps… once or twice a year. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. I try to maintain a healthy diet, so I don’t rely on supplements much. Is that sufficient information? I apologize if I’m being… unhelpful. This is all quite a blur.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Evann. It's completely understandable that it feels blurry, and you're providing me with all the information I need. Ibuprofen occasionally and a multivitamin are good to know. Now, regarding your family history – do you have any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My parents… they lived in Mongolia for most of their lives. Communication was… infrequent. I know my mother had some issues with her heart, later in life. Nothing specific, just… general heart problems. And my father… I believe he had high blood pressure. But again, my recollection is quite vague. I wasn't close enough to know details. I regret not asking more questions when I had the chance. Is that… enough? I feel terrible that I can’t provide more concrete information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It's understandable that you don’t have detailed information, given the circumstances. Knowing about your mother's heart problems and your father's high blood pressure is helpful, and we can note those as potential risks. It’s never too late to feel regret, but it sounds like you’re doing your best to be proactive now. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol - perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but it’s infrequent. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet evening at home, working on my etchings. Or reading. A very… simple life, really. I hope that's… satisfactory? I apologize for the lack of excitement.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly satisfactory, Evann. A simple life sounds lovely, and that’s wonderful. It's good to know. Okay, one final question before we move on to the physical exam. Are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: No… not currently. Occasionally, my hands ache from working, but it’s a minor discomfort. Easily managed with stretching. And… sometimes, I have headaches, as I mentioned earlier. But nothing persistent, nothing debilitating. Overall… I feel quite well. Perhaps a little… tired, sometimes. But I attribute that to the long hours I spend at my workbench. I truly don’t have any major complaints, Doctor. I apologize for the… lack of a more dramatic story. It’s all rather mundane, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not mundane at all, Evann. It's good that you're generally feeling well. A little hand ache and occasional headaches are common, and it's good you've found ways to manage them. The fatigue is something we can discuss further. Alright, with that information, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a standard check of your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I understand it’s standard procedure. Please, proceed when you are ready. I hope I’m not being… difficult. I sometimes worry about taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, Evann. It's my job to make sure we gather all the necessary information. And you are not taking up too much of my time. Your blood pressure is 128/78, pulse is 72 and regular, respiration rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and your balance appears stable. I’m noticing some slight tenderness in your wrists, which is likely related to your work as an etcher. Does this feel particularly painful?
PATIENT: A little, yes. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It’s been… worsening gradually, over the past few months. I usually ignore it, but it’s becoming more difficult to dismiss. I suppose I should have mentioned it earlier, but I didn’t want to… bother you with something so minor. It’s just… an occupational hazard, I assumed. It flares up when I’m working on a particularly intricate piece.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned it now. It's definitely worth investigating, even if you initially thought it was just an occupational hazard. Gradual worsening is something we need to pay attention to. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’m suspecting a possible case of early carpal tunnel syndrome. It’s very common in people who perform repetitive hand movements. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order a nerve conduction study. It’s a non-invasive test that will measure the electrical activity in your nerves. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A nerve conduction study… I’ve… heard of those. It doesn't sound particularly pleasant, but if it will provide a diagnosis, then yes, I suppose it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you believe it’s the best course of action, then I’m willing to proceed. I just… hope it won't be too painful. And I apologize if I'm being overly cautious. I have a… low tolerance for discomfort, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: You're not being overly cautious at all, Evann. It's good to be informed and to have concerns. The nerve conduction study is generally well-tolerated, though it can cause some mild tingling or discomfort during the test. It’s a quick procedure, and the results will help us determine the best course of treatment. While we wait for the results of the nerve conduction study, I recommend that you try to take frequent breaks during your work, stretch your hands and wrists regularly, and consider wearing wrist splints to support your joints. We can also discuss over-the-counter pain relievers if you're experiencing significant discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Wrist splints… that sounds… sensible. I believe I can manage that. And frequent breaks… I should probably be more diligent about that. It’s easy to get lost in my work and lose track of time. Actually, yes. You mentioned Advance Directives and POLST forms earlier. Now that we’ve discussed my health… is it still advisable for me to pursue those? Or is it… premature, given my current situation? I apologize if this is a foolish question. I’m still rather confused about the entire process.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Evann, and absolutely not foolish at all. It’s wise to consider these things, and it's better to ask questions than to remain confused. Given your age and generally good health, a full Advance Directive might be a bit extensive right now. However, a POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – could be very beneficial. It allows you to document your wishes regarding certain medical interventions, like CPR or intubation, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. It’s particularly helpful if you have strong preferences about those types of interventions. Would you be interested in learning more about the POLST form?
PATIENT: A POLST form… that sounds… more manageable than a full Advance Directive. And the idea of documenting my wishes… that appeals to me. It’s… reassuring to have that control, even if it’s just a hypothetical situation. Yes, please. I would be very grateful if you could explain it to me in more detail. And if there’s a form I can take with me, to review at my own pace, that would be wonderful. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I truly don’t mean to be a burden.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden at all, Evann. That’s what I’m here for. The POLST form is designed to be a simple, one-page document that outlines your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. You can discuss it with your family and loved ones, and you can change it at any time. It’s important to remember that it only applies if you are unable to communicate your wishes yourself. For example, here, you can choose whether or not you want CPR performed if your heart stops beating. You can also specify whether or not you want intubation, which is the insertion of a breathing tube to help you breathe. Take your time reviewing it, and don't hesitate to ask me any questions you may have. We can discuss it further at your next appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: This is… very thorough. And the explanations are quite clear. I believe I understand the basic concept, but… it’s difficult to imagine being in a situation where I would need to make these decisions. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Perhaps after I’ve had a chance to review it more thoroughly, something will occur to me. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… remarkably patient and understanding. I truly appreciate your time and assistance. And the wrist splint suggestion, of course. It’s all very… reassuring. I think that’s all for today, if you’re quite finished.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. Remember, take your time with the POLST form, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. And please, don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the nerve conduction study and how you’re feeling. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon.
