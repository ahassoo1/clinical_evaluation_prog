DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Petrimoulx. It is… pleasant to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my memory has been troubling me lately. It is not a complete loss, you understand, but… things are slipping. Small things, mostly. And my blood pressure has been… elevated, the pharmacist says. It is a worry. I wish to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Memory concerns and elevated blood pressure are certainly things we want to address. It's good you're being proactive about this. “Slipping,” you say – could you give me a little more detail about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… difficult to explain precisely. I remember dates, names of people I have known for a long time… details of my past are very clear, actually. But recently… if someone tells me something, even just a few minutes ago, I sometimes… forget. Or I misplace things – not important things, usually, like my keys or glasses. And… I repeat myself, I think. My neighbor mentioned it. It is… frustrating. I do not like to be… inefficient.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, it sounds like your long-term memory feels intact, but you’re experiencing some difficulty with recent memory and perhaps some repetition. And it's causing you some frustration, which is completely understandable. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little bit about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: It is… perhaps six months ago? Maybe a little longer. It started very slowly, I think. I would forget why I went into a room, or the name of a new acquaintance. I dismissed it as simply… being busy. I manage many properties, you see, and the community association… it requires a great deal of attention. But it has become… more noticeable in the last few months. My neighbor, Mrs. Dubrovsky, she pointed it out after I asked her the same question three times in one afternoon. It was… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s been a gradual onset over about six months, and it's recently become more bothersome, to the point where others are noticing it. That's good information. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes. Let me think. My… sleep is not as good as it once was. I wake often, and sometimes feel tired even after a full night. And… I have had some headaches, although they are not severe. More of a… pressure, around my temples. And, truthfully, my mood has been… less cheerful than usual. I find myself… easily irritated. But I attribute that to the stress of everything. I am a widow, you see, and I manage all the affairs myself. It is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that. It sounds like you’re dealing with a great deal, and it’s very helpful for me to get a complete picture. Sleep disturbances, headaches, and changes in mood can all be relevant. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: I do not mind. I have… high blood pressure, as we discussed. It has been… managed for many years, with medication. My doctor… he passed away, some time ago. A very good man. I have also had… arthritis, in my knees. It is… uncomfortable, but I manage with over-the-counter remedies. And… I had a bout of pneumonia, several years ago. But otherwise… I have been… relatively healthy, for my age. I do not… enjoy doctors, truthfully. I prefer to be… independent.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, hypertension managed with medication, arthritis, and a history of pneumonia. And I understand your preference for independence – many people feel that way. Can you tell me what medications you are currently taking for your blood pressure, if you know the names?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have… a small pill box. It is… Lisinopril, I believe. And… Hydrochlorothiazide. Yes, those two. I take them every morning, with my breakfast. And… sometimes, I take Ibuprofen for my knees, when they are particularly… troublesome. I do not take it every day, only when needed. I believe that is all. I am… quite organized, you see. I keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide for blood pressure, and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. That's very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. I have eaten… everything, in my life. I have travelled extensively, you see, and I have never had a… reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a… strong stomach. And I have never had a… skin reaction to any lotions or creams. No, no allergies. I am… quite fortunate, in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you’re comfortable sharing. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. My mother… she had heart problems, towards the end of her life. She needed… a pacemaker, I believe. And my… grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… something with his memory. Not… Alzheimer’s, exactly, but he became… confused, in his later years. He needed… care. My aunt said it was… hereditary, perhaps. But that was many years ago. And my father… he had diabetes. But otherwise… no, not much else. It is… difficult to remember precisely. My family… we are… scattered now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother, some memory issues in your grandfather, and diabetes in your father. That gives me a better picture. Now, to get a fuller understanding, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. My lifestyle… is quite busy, as I mentioned. I manage several properties – apartments, mostly. It requires a great deal of… oversight. I am constantly on the phone, scheduling repairs, dealing with tenants. And I am the treasurer for the community association – that involves… meetings, budgets, and paperwork. I do not… have much free time, truthfully. I used to enjoy… gardening, but I have not had the time lately. I eat… reasonably well, mostly. I try to avoid… processed foods. And I do not… drink alcohol, or smoke. I believe in… moderation.
DOCTOR: That paints a clear picture. A very active lifestyle, managing properties and the community association. You prioritize healthy eating and avoid smoking and alcohol. Very good. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is… acceptable. I would prefer it to be… quick, if possible. I have appointments later this afternoon. But… yes, proceed. I trust your… judgment, Doctor Petrimoulx. I simply wish to understand… what is happening. And to… resolve it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 148/92. That is a bit elevated, as we discussed. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination and balance appear good. I'm going to ask you to repeat a few words after me, if you don't mind. Just to check your short-term memory. Can you repeat these three words for me: Apple, Table, Penny?
PATIENT: Apple, Table, Penny. Yes, that is… quite simple. I remember them easily. I have a… good memory, you know, for most things. But… as I said, the recent… things are… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Yes, you repeated them perfectly. And I believe you. It's good to know your long-term memory is strong. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those same three words in about five minutes. Just to get a better idea of your recent recall. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your elevated blood pressure could be contributing to some of your symptoms, as could stress and the demands of your busy lifestyle. The memory concerns, however, warrant further investigation. While it could be related to stress, we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: I understand. So… what do you propose? I do not wish to… undergo extensive testing, if it is not necessary. I simply wish to… understand what is happening, and to… restore my efficiency.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns. I wouldn’t recommend anything unnecessary. I think the most prudent next step would be to order some blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, rule out any vitamin deficiencies, check your thyroid function, and get a baseline for your kidney and liver function. It will also help us rule out other potential causes for your memory concerns. I would also like to recommend a simple cognitive assessment – a brief questionnaire that will help us evaluate your memory and thinking skills more objectively. It's non-invasive and takes about 15-20 minutes. Finally, given your blood pressure readings, I think it's important to start a trial of medication to better control it. We can monitor your blood pressure closely and adjust the dosage as needed. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds acceptable. Blood work, a questionnaire… and medication for the blood pressure. Yes, I can agree to that. As long as it is… not too disruptive to my schedule. When can I expect the results of the blood work? And… how long will the questionnaire take? I have appointments on Friday.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write the orders for the blood work and the cognitive assessment now. The blood work should take a couple of days to process, and we'll have the results by Wednesday at the latest. I’ll have my nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. The cognitive assessment can be done here in the office today – it will take about 15-20 minutes, as I mentioned. My nurse can get you set up for that right after this visit. We can start you on a low dose of Lisinopril today, and I’ll give you instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home. We can adjust the dosage at your follow-up appointment based on your readings. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is… manageable. Blood work by Wednesday, the questionnaire today… and start the medication. Very good. I will… monitor my blood pressure closely. And I will… attend the follow-up appointment. I appreciate your… thoroughness, Doctor Petrimoulx. Now, if you will excuse me… I have appointments to reschedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have my nurse come in and get you set up for the cognitive assessment and provide you with instructions for the Lisinopril. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Alvara. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking the first step to address these concerns is excellent. I’m confident we can work together to get you feeling better.
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. Goodbye. .
