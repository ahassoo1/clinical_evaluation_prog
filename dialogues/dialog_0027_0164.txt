DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I had some fava beans with dinner. I love fava beans, but now… I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay…tired and yellow…and it started after eating fava beans. Can you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s not just regular tired, you know? It’s…deep. Like my batteries are completely drained, even after a full night’s sleep. I’ve also been feeling a bit weak, and a little breathless just walking up the stairs. It’s worrying me, honestly. I usually have quite a bit of energy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Deep tiredness and weakness…and shortness of breath. And you said this all started after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I had them on Saturday night, and by Sunday I was starting to feel off. And then yesterday it got much worse. I didn't really connect it at first, but then I remembered reading something…years ago, about fava beans and…something about the blood? I'm not very good at remembering medical things. It just vaguely rings a bell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a connection to the fava beans, and something about the blood… Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My pee has been…darker than usual, almost tea-colored. And my stomach feels a bit uncomfortable, not exactly pain, but just…off. I haven't been sick or anything like that. Oh, and I feel a little bit itchy all over, but that might just be the summer heat, I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, stomach discomfort, and some itching… Do you have any known allergies, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything… until maybe these fava beans! I eat everything, honestly. I'm Romanian, you know, we have a pretty hearty diet! I've never had trouble with food before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to eat healthy, that’s about it. No pills, no vitamins, nothing. I really don’t like taking medications if I can avoid it. I prefer a good cup of herbal tea, if that counts!
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I want to check your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin. We’ll also need to do some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to feel better, so whatever you think is best. Blood work sounds… not fun, but necessary, I suppose. Just let me know if it will be painful.
DOCTOR: Okay. It will be a quick pinch, but nothing too bad. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Is that alright? Do you hear anything unusual? I always worry about my breathing, to be honest. My grandmother had… well, never mind. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a little…wheezy, but not alarming at this point. Your heart sounds regular. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender to the touch. And I can see a slight yellowing of your skin and eyes – what we call jaundice. Now, let's get some blood work done to help us figure out what’s going on. I'll order a complete blood count, a liver function test, and a test for G6PD deficiency. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. G6PD deficiency… is that related to the fava beans? I vaguely remember hearing something about that, too. If it helps, please go ahead with all those tests. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it. .
DOCTOR: Yes, G6PD deficiency can be related to fava beans. It's an enzyme deficiency that can cause the red blood cells to break down when exposed to certain triggers, including fava beans. We'll get those tests done, and I'll let you know the results as soon as they're available. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods that might trigger a reaction. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
