DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, I think. Been a bit of trouble getting things going, you know? Not as easy as it used to be. It’s been… a while now. I forget exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination. You mentioned it's been going on for a while – can you try to estimate how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it feels like… after my Harold retired, maybe? He retired… oh, a good ten years ago, I reckon. Maybe more. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? It’s not painful, exactly. Just… slow. And I have to… push a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, roughly ten years of gradually increasing difficulty with urination, requiring some effort to start and maintain the stream. Has it been getting consistently worse over those ten years, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm. Come and go… I think… mostly worse, yeah. Some days are better than others, but generally, it's getting harder. Not a lot harder each day, just… little by little. It's not something I worried about much at first, you know? Old age, I figured. But it's… bothersome now. I gotta go more often, too. Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual worsening over ten years, with increasing frequency, particularly at night. That's helpful. When you say “more often,” could you give me a rough estimate of how many times you're urinating during the day and how many times at night, compared to, say, five years ago?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Numbers… I’m not so good with numbers. Five years ago… well, Harold was still around then, and I mostly remember taking care of him. But I think… during the day, maybe three or four times? Now… maybe six? Seven? Something like that. And at night… used to be none. Now… oh, I get up… at least twice. Sometimes three times. It wakes me up, you know? It's a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency to approximately six or seven times during the day, and two to three times at night, compared to three or four times a day and none at night five years ago. Do you experience any leakage with coughing, sneezing, or exercise?
PATIENT: Leakage? Oh… sometimes. When I laugh, mostly. A little giggle gets away from me, and then… a little wetness. It's not a lot. And when I lift something heavy… sometimes then too. Not always, mind you. Just… occasionally. It's embarrassing, you know? Harold used to say not to worry about it, but… he’s gone now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional leakage with laughter and lifting. It's understandable to find that embarrassing, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Dr. Ito, back in town… he said my blood pressure was a little high once. A long time ago. He put me on a little pill, but I didn’t like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. And… Harold always said I was a bit anemic. But I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with anything, really. Just… old age things. I go to the doctor for checkups, but they never find much wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that was treated briefly with medication, and a mention of possible anemia. And you haven’t been formally diagnosed with any other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgeries… let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s about it, I think. And… when I broke my wrist, a long time ago, playing netball. They put it in a cast. But no big surgeries, no. And… I was in the hospital when I had my babies, of course. But that was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, wrist fracture repaired with a cast, and deliveries of your babies. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems in the men, or urinary issues in the women?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Harold’s father… he had trouble with his… waterworks, yes. Couldn’t go properly, he said. Always complaining about it. And… my sister, Margaret… she had some kind of bladder infection, I think. Kept going back to the doctor. But… I don’t really remember much about it. We didn't talk about these things much, back then. It wasn’t polite, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of urinary issues in Harold’s father and a bladder infection in your sister Margaret. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… just a little something for my arthritis, you know? My fingers get stiff. And… sometimes I take a little something for my sleep. But that's it, really. Just the arthritis pills, and the sleep thing when I can't get to sleep. Oh! And a vitamin D, the doctor said I was low. That's all. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for arthritis, a sleep aid occasionally, and vitamin D supplements. And you have no known allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, dear. No allergies. Never had any trouble with that. Just the usual old age aches and pains. Nothing to make me sneeze or swell up. Thank goodness for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a brief neurological exam. And then I’d like to do a gentle pelvic exam to assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles. It's important to check these muscles as they support the bladder. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh. A… pelvic exam? Well, I… I haven't had one of those in a long, long time. Is it… necessary? I mean, I just thought it was my waterworks, you know? I don’t understand why you need to… check things down there.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Ms. Stoffregen. You are right to ask. The pelvic exam allows me to assess the strength of the muscles that support your bladder, which can contribute to urinary symptoms. It also helps me to rule out other potential causes for your difficulty urinating, like a prolapse or other changes. It’s a quick exam, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We can absolutely skip it if you’re not comfortable, but it would give me a more complete picture of what’s going on. We can discuss the pros and cons further if you’d like. And if you’re still not comfortable, we can start with just listening to your heart, lungs, and checking your abdomen. What would make you feel the most at ease?
PATIENT: Oh… well. That’s… that’s kind of you to explain it. It just feels… invasive, you know? I haven't had one since… Harold was still alive, I think. Maybe before. Perhaps… perhaps if you explained exactly what you’re going to do, before you do it? And if it gets too uncomfortable, can I just… stop you? I don’t want to be rude, but… I’m an old woman, and things aren't as… flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. That is perfectly reasonable, and I am happy to explain everything thoroughly beforehand, and you can stop me at any time. It’s your body, and your comfort is my top priority. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope, and then gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. For the pelvic exam, you’ll lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal, similar to a Pap smear, and visually inspect the area. This may cause some mild discomfort, but it should not be painful. Then, I will gently assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles with a finger, to check for weakness. The entire exam will be done with as much care and gentleness as possible. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little less frightening, you explained it like that. I still don’t like the sound of the speculum, but… I suppose it has to be done if you think it's necessary. Alright. Let's just… get it over with. But please, be gentle. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don’t want any surprises. And if it hurts, I’ll tell you. Promise?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I promise to be as gentle as possible and to explain every step as I go. And you can absolutely tell me if anything feels uncomfortable, and we will stop immediately. Okay, let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. I’m just going to place this cool end of the stethoscope on your chest and back, and listen to your breathing and heartbeat. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. It’s a bit chilly. My old bones get cold easily these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a bit cool in here. Everything sounds good with your heart and lungs, nice and clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful when I press here. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not yet. A little pressure, but nothing… alarming. Right there, maybe? It’s always a bit… sensitive there after I eat. But it’s not a sharp pain, just… a fullness. Like it’s bloated.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the lower left abdomen. That’s good information to have. It sounds like that might be related to digestion. Now, if you are comfortable, we can proceed with the pelvic exam. Remember, you can stop me at any time. Would you like me to explain the process again before we begin?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Just… remind me exactly what you’re going to do with that… speculum. And how long it will take. It’s just… I’ve never been one for these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I completely understand. The speculum is a gently curved, smooth instrument that we use to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visually inspect your cervix and the lining of your vagina. It’s similar to what's used during a Pap smear. It allows me to check for any signs of irritation, infection, or other abnormalities. We’ll use a small amount of lubricant to make it more comfortable. It may feel a little bit of pressure as it’s inserted, but it shouldn't be painful. I'll be very gentle and take my time. The exam itself usually takes only a few minutes, maybe two or three minutes at most. Then I'll gently assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles with a single finger, which also only takes a moment. Throughout the process, I will explain everything I'm doing and check in with you to make sure you're comfortable. And again, if at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know, and we will stop immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Two or three minutes… that doesn’t sound so bad. And you’ll tell me everything you’re doing. And I can stop you if it hurts. Yes. Let’s… let’s just get it over with. But please, be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. Very gentle. I promise. Okay. First, I’m going to have you bend your knees and feet flat on the table. I'll drape a sheet over your lower body for privacy and warmth. Then, I’ll use a warm, lubricated speculum to gently open the vaginal canal. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just try to relax your muscles as much as possible. I’m just going to let you know when I’m starting… and if you feel any discomfort, tell me immediately. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Alright… I think so. Just… don’t rush. And talk to me. It helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I am going to gently insert the lubricated speculum now. This may feel a little bit of pressure, just like you said. Just breathe deeply and try to relax. I'm just opening it slowly… slowly… how are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… it's… a bit uncomfortable. A cold feeling. Not pain, exactly… just… strange. And a little bit of pressure, yes. Is it almost done?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm just almost finished inserting it… and now I'm just gently opening it a little bit more to get a good view. You are doing great. Just focus on your breathing. I'm just taking a quick look at your cervix now… everything looks normal so far. Just a little bit of redness, which is common. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… it's getting a bit… tighter now. A little bit more pressure. Is… is it normal to feel this much pressure? It’s not pain, but… it’s not comfortable either.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. It sounds like it's a little uncomfortable. It’s okay to let me know if you need me to stop at any point. I’m just going to gently assess the lining of your vagina now. This won't take long. But if you feel any discomfort, please tell me immediately. I’m just taking a quick look… everything looks normal so far. How are you doing?
PATIENT: Oh… it's alright. Just a little bit… stretched. And that cold feeling. If it's almost done… then I can handle it. But please be quick. And gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm almost finished now. Just finishing up the assessment of your vaginal lining… everything looks healthy. Now I'm just going to gently remove the speculum. Just a moment… and there we go. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… much better. A relief to have that thing out. A little sore, maybe, but… not terrible. Thank you for being so gentle. And for explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm so glad it's over and that you're feeling a little better now. I apologize if it was uncomfortable, and I’m glad you felt comfortable letting me know. Now, I’m just going to gently assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles with a single finger. This will help me understand if any weakness might be contributing to your urinary symptoms. It won’t be painful, just a little bit of pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Just… not too deep, please. And tell me what you’re doing. Just quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I understand. Just a gentle touch now… and I'm just going to ask you to squeeze your muscles, like you're stopping the flow of urine. Just squeeze… and relax. Good. Just one more time… squeeze… and relax. Okay, that’s all I need. That was great. Everything feels normal. There's some mild weakness, which is common at your age, but it's nothing too concerning. Okay. That’s the end of the exam. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Not too bad. Just a bit tired, I think. All that… squeezing. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate you being so patient and explaining everything. It wasn't as frightening as I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm glad to hear that. Now, based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a combination of age-related changes contributing to your urinary symptoms. Specifically, the mild weakness in your pelvic floor muscles, combined with the changes in bladder function that often come with age, are likely causing the increased frequency, difficulty starting the stream, and occasional leakage. It’s very common at your age, and there are things we can do to help manage it. Do you have any questions for me before we discuss those options?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… reasonable. Age-related… yes, that’s probably it. I’ve just been hoping it wasn’t anything serious. What kind of things can you do about it? Pills? Exercises? I don’t want anything too… complicated. I’m an old woman, you know. My bones aren't what they used to be. And I don’t want to spend all day in the bathroom!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, I completely understand your concerns. We have a few options that aren't too complicated. Pills aren't usually the first line of treatment for these types of symptoms, unless we suspect another underlying issue. The main things we can focus on are lifestyle modifications and pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. Lifestyle modifications include things like avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder, and making sure you're drinking enough water. Pelvic floor exercises can help strengthen those muscles and improve bladder control. They're simple exercises you can do anywhere, anytime. I can show you how to do them correctly, and we can start slowly. There are also resources, like pamphlets and online videos, that can help. We could also discuss a bladder diary to help track your fluid intake and urination patterns. That can help us identify any patterns or triggers. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: Oh… exercises. I suppose I could try exercises. I used to be a netball player, you know. Strong legs, I had. But that was a long time ago. A diary… yes, I could do a diary. I used to keep a diary when I was a girl. It might be helpful. I don’t want to take any pills, if I can avoid it. And I’ll try to cut back on the coffee. Harold always said I drank too much coffee. Can you show me how to do these exercises? Properly? I don’t want to make things worse. And what about the diary? What do I write down?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that sounds great! We'll definitely focus on the exercises and the diary, and avoid pills if possible. Let's start with the exercises. These are called Kegel exercises. To do them correctly, you want to squeeze the muscles you would use to stop the flow of urine. Imagine you're trying to stop yourself from urinating, but don’t actually stop the flow of urine while you're practicing. Just squeeze those muscles, hold for a few seconds, and then relax. You should feel a tightening sensation in your pelvic area. Start with 10 squeezes, three times a day. You can do them anywhere – while you’re sitting, standing, or even lying down. It’s important to focus on squeezing the correct muscles – you don’t want to squeeze your stomach or leg muscles. It takes practice, but you'll get the hang of it. Now, for the diary, you’ll just write down everything you drink and when you urinate. Include the time you drink or urinate, the amount you drink, and the amount of urine you pass. Also, note any times you experience leakage or urge to urinate. I'll give you a sample diary form to start with. We can review your diary at your next appointment, and I can help you identify any patterns or triggers. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Squeeze the right muscles, not the wrong ones. That’s important. And write down everything. Like a detective, I suppose. I suppose I can try. It’s better than just sitting around worrying about it. When is my next appointment? And do I need to bring the diary with me? And… what if I forget to write something down? I’m an old woman, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that's a great attitude! Just take things one step at a time, and don’t worry about perfection. Your next appointment is scheduled for August 23rd, at 10:00 AM. Please bring the diary with you, so we can review it together. And don’t worry about forgetting to write something down. Just do your best, and write down whatever you remember. We can fill in the gaps at your appointment. It’s more important to get a general idea of your fluid intake and urination patterns. I’m also going to give you a handout with more information about pelvic floor exercises and managing urinary symptoms. And I can provide you with some resources online if you’re interested. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh… August 23rd. Yes, I can remember that. August 23rd. And a handout… that’s good. I like handouts. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll try my best with the exercises and the diary. And I’ll see you on August 23rd.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen. That's wonderful to hear. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you on August 23rd. Have a good day!
