DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. It started a few days ago and it’s not getting any better. I’ve been told I have a funny heartbeat, atrial… something, and I wondered if that might be connected?
DOCTOR: Hmm, a swollen leg and a funny heartbeat… that's good information to start with. Just to clarify, when you say “a few days ago,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was after the Highland Games, I believe. That was… July 29th? So, maybe three or four days ago. It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little puffiness, but it’s gotten worse each day since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around July 29th after the Highland Games. And you’ve noticed it gradually getting more swollen. Is the swelling in the entire leg, or is it more localized—like your calf or ankle, for example?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower leg, I think. From my knee down, really. And my ankle is… quite thick, if I’m honest. It’s a bit uncomfortable to walk on, too. Not painful, exactly, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mostly below the knee, with the ankle being particularly thick, and causing some discomfort when walking. Now, about this heartbeat you mentioned… who told you about it, and do you know any details about what they said?
PATIENT: It was Doctor MacIntyre, my GP back in Inverness. He did an… a tracing, I suppose you call it, with sticky pads and everything. He said something about ‘atrial fibrillation’ and that I needed to… keep an eye on it. He’s the one who suggested I see someone about it, especially with my leg being like this. I didn’t really understand what he said, to be fair. It sounded serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. MacIntyre mentioned atrial fibrillation. That is something we definitely want to look into, especially in combination with the swelling in your leg. It's good you’re following up on this. Now, let’s talk a little bit more about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I've always been quite healthy, to be honest. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major. I did break my arm once falling out of a tree, but that was years ago. And now this… funny heartbeat. Is it alright if I ask what exactly is atrial fibrillation? Doctor MacIntyre didn’t explain it very well.
DOCTOR: Of course, it’s perfectly alright to ask! It's important you understand what's going on. Basically, your heart has a natural rhythm, like a regular beat. Atrial fibrillation – or “AFib” – is when the upper chambers of your heart beat irregularly and sometimes too quickly. It can sometimes cause symptoms like palpitations, shortness of breath, and, in some cases, it can increase the risk of blood clots. It sounds complicated, but we’ll get to the bottom of it. Now, back to you – have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not a one. I've been very lucky, I think. And thank you for explaining the heartbeat thing, that makes a bit more sense. Is the swelling in my leg… related to that, do you think? Is it dangerous? I'm a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It could be related, yes. AFib can sometimes increase the risk of blood clots, and those clots can travel to your leg and cause swelling. However, there are many other possible causes for leg swelling, so we'll need to investigate further. It's good you're feeling a bit more informed, and it's perfectly okay to be worried - that's a normal reaction. Let's move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, grandparents, siblings—has had heart problems, blood clots, or a similar condition?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My father had a… a weak heart, I think. He didn’t do a lot of physical work, always sitting and reading. He passed away a few years ago, when I was quite young. My mother… she was always very healthy, never a day’s illness. I don’t know about grandparents, they passed away before I was born. So, just my father, really, and it wasn’t a very strong condition, if that makes sense. He just… tired easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had some heart issues, mostly fatigue, and your mother was generally healthy. That's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. I did try it once, at a party, but I didn't like it. It made me cough terribly. I do drink a little bit, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing excessive. I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, and only occasional light drinking. Now, let's talk about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers?
PATIENT: I don’t take any regular medication, no. Not even painkillers. I might take a paracetamol for a headache sometimes, but that’s it. I’m not very good with taking pills, if I’m honest. I prefer to just rest if I’m feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, insect bites?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've eaten all sorts of things and never had a reaction. And I'm quite fond of bees, actually. I haven’t been stung recently, but I haven’t had any problems with them in the past. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Is that alright? I hope I’m not forgetting anything. It’s a lot to remember!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright! You're doing wonderfully, and it's good you haven't forgotten anything major. Now, let's have a look at your leg. Would you mind if I did a quick physical examination?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Please do. I'm ready when you are. I'm a little worried, but I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on the examination table, if you don’t mind. First, I'm going to check your pulse. Your pulse is a little fast, but not alarmingly so. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. I'm palpating your calf… there’s some tenderness here, and it feels warm to the touch. And yes, there’s definitely some swelling present, and I can see some pitting edema when I press on your ankle. I’m listening for any abnormal sounds in your leg. Sounds normal. The skin is also a little discolored in places. Finally, I’m checking the temperature difference between your legs. There’s a slight difference in temperature, with your left leg being warmer than your right. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. It seems there is some inflammation and swelling present. We’ll need to investigate this further to determine the cause.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Inflammation and swelling… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? What sort of investigation are you thinking of, Doctor? Will I need… injections? Or maybe surgery? I get quite nervous around needles, and I really don’t want an operation.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Nixon, and it's good you're expressing your concerns. We're just gathering information at this point. I wouldn’t jump to injections or surgery at all. First, I’d like to order a blood test. This will help us assess your overall health, check for any signs of infection, and rule out any underlying conditions. I would also like to consider a D-dimer test, which helps to detect blood clots. Additionally, I'm going to recommend an ultrasound of your leg to visualize the veins and arteries and check for any blockages. Do you have any known bleeding disorders, or are you on any blood-thinning medications?
PATIENT: No, I definitely don’t have any bleeding disorders. I bruise easily, perhaps, but nothing major. And as I said earlier, I don't take any medication at all, so no blood-thinners either. An ultrasound… will it hurt? And the blood test… how much blood will they take? I do get a bit faint sometimes.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound shouldn’t hurt at all, Nixon. It's completely painless. A technician will simply apply a gel to your leg and move a wand over it, creating an image on a screen. As for the blood test, it’s just a small sample—usually a few vials. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist knows you sometimes get faint, and they’ll take extra care to make you comfortable. You can lie down during the blood test if you prefer. I can also recommend a colleague, Doctor Campbell, who is excellent at putting patients at ease. Would you like me to write a referral for those tests, and do you have any questions about where to go to get them done?
PATIENT: Yes, please do write a referral. That would be wonderful. And Doctor Campbell sounds very nice, thank you. As for where to go… I'm not sure. I’m new to the area, as you know, and I don’t have a regular doctor here yet. Perhaps somewhere nearby would be best? I don’t want to have to travel too far if I’m feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll write a referral to the Suburban Diagnostic Center. It's just down the road, about a ten-minute drive, and they have a good reputation. They're very experienced with these types of tests. I’ll also include a note for Doctor Campbell, explaining your concerns about fainting. Now, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible, keeping it cool, and staying hydrated. If you notice any sudden increase in pain, redness, or warmth, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly and for being so patient with me. I feel a lot less worried now. Elevating my leg and staying hydrated… I can do that. And I’ll contact you if anything changes. I think… I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I’m glad I could ease your mind. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. The results usually take a couple of days, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
