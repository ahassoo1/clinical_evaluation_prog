DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think? For my weight. It's… a bit of a blur, honestly. My wife mostly set it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, surgery for weight loss. I understand your wife assisted with the appointment – that’s helpful. It sounds like you’re not entirely sure what the plan is yet, and that’s perfectly alright. Let's start with understanding what's been going on. Could you tell me a bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: Weight history… hmm. That’s tough. I’ve… always been a bigger guy, I guess? I don’t really remember a time when I wasn’t. It’s gotten worse over the last… few years, maybe? I eat… regularly. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but… I don’t know. It’s just… been like this a long time. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's completely understandable. We can work through this together. “Always been a bigger guy” is a good starting point. And it's helpful you mention it's been getting worse recently. When you say “worse,” what specifically has changed?
PATIENT: Uh… well, I get tired easier, definitely. Like, walking up the stairs… that’s become a thing. And my clothes… I keep having to buy bigger sizes. It’s just… uncomfortable, you know? And I get… winded easily, even doing simple stuff. I also think my knees hurt more, but… I’m not sure if that’s just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, difficulty with stairs, needing larger clothing sizes, shortness of breath with exertion, and possible knee pain. Those are all important things to note. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Probably… last year, maybe? Around this time, I think. It was gradual, though. Not like one day it was suddenly bad. Just… slowly getting worse. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when. My wife probably remembers better. She’s always paying attention to these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Mr. Kochubey – changes often creep up gradually. So, roughly a year ago, things started to decline. And it sounds like your wife is a good support. Now, aside from these changes, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I… I get headaches sometimes. Not terrible ones, but… frequent. And I sweat a lot. More than I used to, I mean. Especially at night. And… sometimes I feel a little… anxious, I guess? But… I've always been a bit of a worrier. I don’t know if that’s related, though.
DOCTOR: Headaches, increased sweating – particularly at night – and some anxiety. Okay, those are important to document. The night sweats are particularly noteworthy. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so? I’ve never really been sick, to be honest. I had… the flu a couple of times, I guess, but nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medications. My wife keeps telling me to see a doctor, but I always put it off. I just… don’t like going to the doctor. It's not fun.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people feel that way. So, no previous diagnoses and no regular medications. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. Everything’s always… just worked. Until now, I guess. I've been lucky, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My dad… he was a big guy too. And he had… I think it was something with his heart. My mom… she was pretty healthy, I think. She died a few years ago, but she didn’t really have any… major health problems. My wife said something about diabetes on her side of the family, but I don’t really remember the details. It's a big family, so it's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father and possible diabetes in your wife’s family. That’s good information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t like smoking. Makes me cough just being around it. My wife doesn't smoke either, so we don't have any of that in the house.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… I have a beer sometimes. Usually on the weekends. Nothing crazy, though. Maybe one or two. My wife will have a glass of wine with dinner now and then. We don’t really drink much. It’s not a habit, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear. And finally, are there any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife always asks, but… nope, nothing comes to mind. I'm pretty lucky, I think. Aside from everything else, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for answering all those questions, Mr. Kochubey. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m just… ready to figure out what’s going on and get things sorted out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now, I’m going to listen to different areas on your chest and back. Heart sounds are regular, but I do note some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. I’ll need to listen more carefully when you exhale. There are some mild wheezes bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148/92, and pulse is 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. I’ll also quickly check your abdomen and listen for any unusual sounds. Abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. Sounds are normal. Finally, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay, that’s a quick overview. I’m going to write these findings down.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. Everything seemed alright, though, right? Apart from the… wheezes and tenderness? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. The mild wheezing and tenderness are things we need to investigate further, but they aren’t necessarily cause for alarm at this point. The elevated blood pressure is also something to keep an eye on. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, shortness of breath, weight gain, night sweats – and these findings from the exam, I suspect there could be a few possibilities. It could be related to sleep apnea, which can cause fatigue and weight gain. The wheezing could indicate some mild asthma, or a different respiratory issue. And the night sweats and tenderness warrant some further investigation to rule out any underlying infection or other medical conditions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also recommend a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. And I think it would be helpful to do an EKG to check your heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. Blood work, X-ray, EKG… My wife will want to know all of this. I’m… I’m not very good with medical stuff, you know? Is this because of the surgery? Are you saying I’m not healthy enough for the surgery?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Mr. Kochubey, and I want to be very clear. These tests aren't necessarily to determine if you’re not a candidate for surgery. They’re to get a comprehensive understanding of your overall health before we consider any surgical options. It’s standard procedure to ensure you’re in the best possible condition, and to identify and address any underlying issues that could affect your recovery. We need to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms before attributing them solely to your weight. For example, if we discover an underlying respiratory issue, we need to address that first. Similarly, if there's a thyroid problem, we need to stabilize that before considering surgery. Think of it as a thorough check-up to ensure we’re making the safest and most informed decision for your health. We’ll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions about the tests I’ve recommended?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little more sense. A check-up… not… a failure. What does the chest X-ray… show? And the blood work… what are you looking for specifically? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s a great question. The chest X-ray helps us visualize your lungs, heart, and blood vessels. It can detect things like pneumonia, fluid buildup, or any abnormalities in the size or shape of your organs. It won’t hurt at all – you simply stand in front of the machine while a technician takes a picture. The blood work gives us a lot of information. The complete blood count checks for things like anemia or infection. The metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. And the thyroid panel checks for any abnormalities in your thyroid hormone levels. It will only involve a small blood sample taken from your arm. There might be a brief pinch, but it’s usually very quick. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. If everything comes back normal, we can then proceed with further evaluation for surgery. But if we find any abnormalities, we’ll address those first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… manageable. A small pinch… I can handle a small pinch. And you said if something is wrong, you’ll fix it first? Before the surgery? That’s… reassuring. What about scheduling these tests? Do I need to make an appointment somewhere?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We’ll address any underlying issues before considering surgery. Your health and safety are our top priority. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and the chest X-ray. You can go to the lab at City General Hospital – it’s just down the street. You don’t need an appointment for the blood work, but I recommend calling the radiology department at City General to schedule the X-ray. The number is 555-123-4567. The EKG can be done here in the office tomorrow morning. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you before you leave. Once you have the results from the lab and the X-ray, you can bring them back to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… explained everything very clearly. And you’ve made me feel… less worried. My wife will be relieved to hear this, too. She’s the one who pushed me to come in, anyway.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. It’s excellent that you have a supportive wife – that makes a big difference. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
