DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Reisig. It is good to meet you too. I am here because… well, my ear. It has been… leaking. A little bit of liquid comes out. It is not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing some leakage from your ear that’s causing discomfort. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this leakage?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe three days ago? I was… cleaning my ear with a cotton swab. I do this often. Not too deep, I think. Then, after, I noticed a small… wetness. It is clear liquid. Sometimes a little bit of… not blood, but… pink. Very small amount of pink. And it… smells a little bit. Not a strong smell, but… something is there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Radillo. So it began about three days ago after you cleaned your ear with a cotton swab, and you’ve noticed clear fluid with sometimes a very small amount of pink-tinged fluid, and a slight odor. I see. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit of pain. Not… sharp pain. More like… pressure. And when I push on the ear, it… hurts a little. Not all the time, but when I touch it. Also… sometimes I hear… a ringing. A quiet ringing. Like… “shhhh”. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing pressure, pain when you touch your ear, and a quiet ringing sound – what we call tinnitus. Has this ringing been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Mostly when I… lie down. When I am sleeping or trying to rest. Then I hear it more. When I am busy… walking, talking, working… I do not notice it so much. It is… a quiet sound, even when I do hear it. Not very loud.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Yes. I think… maybe. It is hard to say. Sometimes… sounds are… muffled. Like when people speak… I need them to repeat. Not always, but more than before. Especially… when the ear is… leaking. When it is dry… hearing is better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so muffled hearing that seems to correlate with the leakage. Thank you. Now, have you had any ear infections in the past, or any other ear problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy… maybe ten years old? I had… very bad pain in my ear. The doctor… put something in my ear. A little tube, I think. He said it was… infection. I do not remember much else. I have not had problems with my ears… since then. Until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of an ear infection as a child with tube placement. And you haven't experienced any issues since then, until now. Have you tried anything to treat this leakage yourself – any over-the-counter medications, ear drops, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I do not know what to use. I… tried to keep it clean. Very gently, with a cloth. But I do not put anything in my ear. I thought it was best to come to the doctor. It… felt important.
DOCTOR: That was a very wise decision, Mr. Radillo. It's good you came in. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ear with an otoscope. This will allow me to see inside your ear canal and assess the situation. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but should be quick. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I will… try to be still. Is it… cold? The instrument? I do not like cold things in my ear.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. It can be slightly cool, yes. I'll warm the speculum first. Okay, I’m going to take a look now. Alright, Mr. Radillo, I can see some inflammation and discharge within your ear canal. Your eardrum appears slightly bulging, and there is some fluid behind it. Based on what you’ve described and what I’m seeing, it looks like you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, with a possible middle ear component. The trauma from the cotton swab likely introduced bacteria, leading to the infection. We will need to rule out a perforated tympanic membrane.
PATIENT: Perforated… what? My… ear drum? Is that… bad? I do not understand. What does that mean? The… bacteria. Will I… lose my hearing? This is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. A perforated tympanic membrane means a tear or hole in your eardrum. It's not always serious, but it can cause pain, hearing loss, and increase the risk of infection. We need to determine if that's happened in your case, and that's why we'll do some further testing. The bacteria are tiny organisms that cause infection. They entered your ear canal after you cleaned it with the cotton swab. It’s common, and we can treat it with antibiotic ear drops, most of the time. We will send a sample to the lab to know which type of bacteria is causing the infection. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a tympanometry test – it’s a quick, painless test that measures how well your eardrum is moving. It will help us confirm whether there's fluid behind the eardrum and assess the extent of the infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it will help to know what is wrong, then yes. I want to know what is happening. And… if I need drops, that sounds good too. The… bacteria. I will not use the cotton swabs anymore, I promise. Very dangerous, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, very dangerous. They often do more harm than good. Good on you for promising to stop using them. Okay, Mr. Radillo, the test is complete. The results do show some fluid behind the eardrum, but thankfully, it doesn't indicate a perforation at this time. This supports my initial assessment of otitis externa with a possible middle ear involvement. I'm going to prescribe you antibiotic ear drops containing ciprofloxacin and dexamethasone. The ciprofloxacin will fight the bacterial infection, and the dexamethasone will help reduce inflammation and discomfort. I'll also prescribe you a short course of oral ibuprofen for pain management. I will also give you a prescription for a topical analgesic like benzocaine to help with the pain while the drops start to work. I'd like you to use the ear drops three times a day for seven days. Make sure to keep your ear dry, and avoid swimming or getting water in your ear during this time. If you experience any increased pain, fever, or discharge, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Seven days of drops. No water in the ear. No cotton swabs. I can remember that. Ciprofloxacin… dexamethasone… I will write those down. And ibuprofen for the pain. And what if… the pain does not go away after seven days? Or… if it gets worse? What then? And… will I need another test?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Radillo. If the pain doesn't improve after seven days, or if it worsens at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me. We may need to consider a different antibiotic or further investigation to rule out other possibilities, such as a more complicated infection or an issue with your inner ear. We may also need to repeat the tympanometry test to see if the fluid has cleared, or consider a referral to an audiologist for a hearing test. However, let’s focus on getting through these seven days of treatment first, and then we’ll re-evaluate if needed. I’ll also give you written instructions detailing the medication dosage, potential side effects, and signs to watch out for. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you. You have… put my mind at ease. I will follow your instructions carefully. Seven days. No water. No cotton swabs. And… if the pain does not go away… I will call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or questions along the way. Wishing you a speedy recovery. .
