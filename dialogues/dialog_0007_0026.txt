DOCTOR: Hi Ardelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. Makes it hard to… do things. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers. Something wasn’t right with my numbers. Honestly, these young people and their tests… I don’t even know what they mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness that comes on suddenly, that’s definitely something we want to look into. And you’re right to ask about those “numbers” – it’s my job to explain them to you, not leave you confused. Let me take a quick look at the lab results… Ah, yes. Your complete blood count came back with a slightly low hemoglobin. That could definitely be contributing to the fatigue. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Hemoglo… what now? Is that… is that serious? I just want to say, I’ve always been a very strong woman. Worked hard my whole life. Commercial diving isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. But this… this isn’t like being tired after a long day on the rig. It's just… gone. Like someone switched me off. And it happens even when I haven't done anything.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving! Wow, that is impressive. You're right to be proud of that. "Hemoglobin" is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen around your body. If it's low – which yours is a little bit – it means your body isn’t getting enough oxygen, and that can definitely cause fatigue. It's good that you're noticing this isn't normal tiredness. When did you first start noticing this feeling of being “switched off”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Let me think. It was… after my daughter visited. She came all the way from California, you see. Lovely girl, but she always makes me do too much. We did a lot of… gardening, I think. And then… and then it just was. Maybe a week or so after she left? It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be. But I do remember feeling perfectly fine before she came. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a week after your daughter’s visit. That’s helpful. And you felt perfectly fine before that. Besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… Well, my muscles ache a bit. Not all the time, but sometimes. And I feel… weak. Like I could barely lift a teacup, if I’m being honest. And everything feels… foggy, you know? Like I’m looking through a cloud. Oh, and I’ve been rather clumsy lately. Nearly tripped over the rug this morning. Which is ridiculous, I’ve walked that rug a thousand times. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches, weakness, feeling foggy, and some clumsiness. That’s all good information. It’s definitely not just “old age” – we want to figure out what’s going on. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I haven’t been eating as much, I suppose. Not because I don't want to, but I just don't feel hungry. Everything seems… tasteless, somehow. And I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven't really been keeping track. My husband does the cooking, you see, and he doesn’t mention it. He just says I’m being fussy. Men, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, food tasting bland, and possible weight loss. That’s a pattern we’re starting to see. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… and I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, that’s why they ache sometimes. But that’s just… old age, again. Nothing serious. And… and my husband says I have high blood pressure, but I don’t feel anything. He’s always fussing about that too. Takes me to the doctor every few months. Honestly, I think he just likes the attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, arthritis in your hands, and high blood pressure. It's good you're keeping up with the doctor's visits for the blood pressure, even if your husband is a bit overzealous about it. Have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had a knee replacement, maybe ten years ago? It was… a long time ago. And… and I think I had something done on my shoulder, but honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. Lots of doctors, lots of needles… It all sort of blends together after a while. Nothing important, I don't think. Just… old age things.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee replacement and something done on your shoulder. We’ll make a note of those. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family… My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my brother… he had diabetes, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I didn’t really pay much attention to those sorts of things. We weren’t a very close family, you see. Mostly just… old age things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of heart condition in your mother and diabetes in your brother. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take a pill for my blood pressure, of course. A little white one. And… and sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my hands are really aching. But that's just when I need it. And… and I think that's all. My husband handles all the pills, you see. He makes sure I take the right ones at the right time. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. He just says I need to take them, and I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for blood pressure and something for arthritis as needed. It sounds like your husband is very involved in managing your medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything, I think. And I’ve never had a reaction to any of my pills, as far as I remember. Although… I did get a bit of a rash once, after using a new hand cream. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember what it was. Nothing important, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, except for a possible reaction to a hand cream in the past. Now, I'd like to ask a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in… well, I can’t even remember. Not since my wedding, probably. And recreational drugs? Oh, dear me, no! I'm a respectable woman. My husband wouldn’t allow it, even if I wanted to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. That’s good to know. Alright Ardelle, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try not to poke too much. My bones ache, you know. And be gentle with my hands, please. They’re very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your hands and knees. Then I'll do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be due to a number of things. Blood pressure is a little elevated, as expected. Your hands do have some swelling and tenderness. It looks like you have some arthritis there. Your knees also have some crepitus and a little bit of stiffness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished. And finally, I'm going to check your balance. Your gait is slightly unsteady. Okay, everything seems to be a little diminished. I will note this.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Everything diminished… Is that serious? I feel perfectly alright, mostly. Just tired, and a bit clumsy. I don’t understand all these… medical things. Is it my age? Is it just old age catching up with me? My husband will be telling me I should have slowed down years ago…
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ardelle. "Diminished" doesn't necessarily mean serious, but it does mean we need to investigate further to find out why things are a little slower or weaker than they should be. It could be related to age, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. The tiredness, the muscle aches, the clumsiness, the diminished reflexes… those all fit together, and we need to figure out the underlying cause. Based on everything you’ve told me and the exam, I’m concerned about a couple of things. One possibility is vitamin deficiency, particularly B12. Another possibility is a thyroid problem, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and cognitive fog. And we need to rule out any neurological issues that could be causing the diminished reflexes. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. I’ll check your complete blood count again, your thyroid levels, your vitamin B12 level, and some other basic markers. It’s a pretty standard panel, and it will give us a lot of information. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try not to take too much blood. I bruise easily, you know. And please tell me what everything means this time. No medical jargon, please. My husband will be so pleased. He always says I need more tests. He likes going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ardelle. I promise I’ll keep the blood draw as minimal as possible, and I will absolutely explain everything in plain English. No jargon, I promise. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. You can go to the lab downstairs whenever you're ready. They’ll just need a small sample of blood, and it should only take a few minutes. Once the results come back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness – please call the office right away. While we wait for the results, I also want to be cautious. Considering your fatigue and some of the physical exam findings, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. It’s okay to walk around the house, but please don’t do any heavy lifting or gardening. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No heavy lifting… that shouldn’t be a problem. My husband does all the heavy lifting anyway. And I’ll try to remember everything you’ve said. No strenuous activity, new symptoms, call the office… It’s a lot to keep track of. My daughter always tells me I need to write things down. She says my memory isn’t what it used to be. Alright. I’ll go to the lab downstairs. When will I get the results? And… and where will I find you?
DOCTOR: The lab will let you know when the results are available, usually through a phone call or online portal. They can also tell you how to access the results online if you prefer. Once I receive the results, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. You can reach me at this clinic, and my extension is 215. If you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office and ask for me. Just to be on the safe side, and since you've mentioned some clumsiness, I also recommend you avoid driving until we get the results back. It’s just a precaution, to avoid any accidents. Alright Ardelle, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No driving… That’s… that’s a bit inconvenient. My husband will have to drive me everywhere. He’ll be pleased, I’m sure. He always said I drive too fast. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… try to remember to explain everything in plain English, please. And don’t take too much blood. Thank you, Doctor. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. I’ll do my best. And I promise to explain everything in plain English. Don’t worry, we'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
