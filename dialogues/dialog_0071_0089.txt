DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this pain. Lower down, you see. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s quite…uncomfortable. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… something being amiss with my system? I’m terribly sorry, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Perhaps a few months?
DOCTOR: A few months, alright. "Something amiss with your system," you say… that’s a bit vague, but we'll get to the bottom of it. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… a heavy ache. A cramping, perhaps? It feels… deep inside. And it radiates, I think? Down my legs a little. It's difficult to explain. Sometimes it's constant, a dull throb, and other times it comes in waves. And when it’s at its worst, it makes me quite nauseous. I haven’t… well, I haven't been able to eat much when it flares up. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I think so. A heavy ache, cramping, radiating down the legs… nausea with flares. That gives me a starting point. Now, roughly where is the pain located?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Right… about here. It’s not precisely pinpointable, Doctor. It seems to be… all over this lower area. Sometimes it feels more on the left side, sometimes the right. It’s rather… elusive, you see. And it seems to shift. I hope that isn’t too confusing.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Alese. Elusive pain can be tricky, but we’ll work through it. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. Let me see… Rest seems to help, a little. Lying down, keeping still. But it doesn't eliminate it, you understand. And… I’ve noticed that if I eat anything too rich or heavy, it seems to aggravate it. And…stress, certainly. When I’m feeling anxious or worried, it gets much worse. Though, truthfully, Doctor, I seem to be worried quite a bit these days. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is relevant, Alese. Stress can exacerbate many conditions. Alright, so rest helps, heavy foods worsen it, and stress is a factor. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes. My previous physician… Dr. Aris, I believe… diagnosed me with… Lupus, was it? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, he called it. SLE, for short. It’s been… well, a long time now. I take medication for it, though I confess I sometimes forget to take it on time. And… I've had some… episodes over the years. Flares, they call them. This pain feels… different, though. That’s why I’m here. Do you… know about Lupus, Doctor? I'm afraid I don’t remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm familiar with Lupus. SLE can certainly cause a variety of symptoms, and flares are common. It's good you brought this up. And you're right to mention that this pain feels different. Now, what medications are you currently taking for your Lupus, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hydroxychloroquine… 200 milligrams, once a day. And… Prednisone. 5 milligrams. Though I’ve been trying to wean myself off of that, Doctor. It makes me… retain water, you see. And I get terribly hungry. I also take… Oh, goodness. I really should keep better track of these things. I apologize. I'm quite sure there was something else... but it escapes me at the moment.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Alese. It’s perfectly understandable. We can look up your medication list in the system if that would be helpful. Hydroxychloroquine and Prednisone… alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Allergies. I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I used to get a bit of a rash from certain soaps when I was younger, but that was many years ago. And I can’t say I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything. But, truthfully, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. I wouldn't want to say definitively if I am allergic to something and then have a reaction here. Would it be alright if we… proceeded with caution?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alese. We will always proceed with caution. That’s standard practice. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history, aside from the Lupus. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh, dear. Let me see. When I was a young woman, I had a rather severe case of pneumonia. I was in the hospital for a week, I believe. And… I had my appendix removed many years ago. But other than that… I don’t recall any other significant hospitalizations. I've had the usual things, of course. Broken bones, the flu… nothing too serious. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm afraid I'm not very good at remembering dates and details.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese. Pneumonia, appendectomy… good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s a difficult one, Doctor. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. Quite severe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He passed away rather young, actually. And… My sister… she was diagnosed with something… a heart condition, perhaps? But I'm terribly vague on the details. We weren't very close, you see. I apologize for being so unhelpful. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Alese. It’s perfectly understandable. Arthritis, high blood pressure, and a possible heart condition… We can document that. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And… I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I believe those things are quite harmful. I always prided myself on living a very… respectable life. Is that satisfactory, Doctor? I hope I'm not being too… forward.
DOCTOR: Perfectly satisfactory, Alese. And thank you for being so open. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your pain or your overall health?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, the pain… it’s been getting progressively worse over the last few weeks. And it’s… it’s interfering with my sleep. I find myself waking up several times during the night, tossing and turning. And… I've been feeling rather fatigued lately, even more so than usual. And my appetite has been… nonexistent. I've lost a little weight, I think. But other than that… I can’t think of anything else at the moment. I do apologize if I'm forgetting something important. It's just… everything feels a bit muddled these days. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, progressively worsening pain, interfering with sleep, increased fatigue, loss of appetite, and weight loss… Thank you, Alese. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to get a better sense of the pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s alright. Though, I must warn you, my abdomen is rather sensitive at the moment. Please be gentle. And… I apologize in advance if I flinch. It’s just… it’s quite painful. Is there anything I should do during the exam? Perhaps close my eyes? Or… just breathe deeply? I want to be as helpful as possible.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. We will be very gentle. You can close your eyes if you wish, or just focus on your breathing. Whatever makes you most comfortable. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Hmm. Tenderness in the lower abdomen, primarily on the left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in the lower abdomen. Can you tell me if this is new?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s… tender. Especially there, on the left side. And… The swelling… yes, I believe that is new. I hadn’t really noticed it before, but now that you mention it… yes, my abdomen does feel a bit… distended. It’s not terribly noticeable, but it’s definitely there. It’s been getting worse over the last few days, I think. Oh dear. Is that… is that a bad sign, Doctor? I apologize for being such a worry. I just… I don’t want this to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Alese, you're not being a worry at all. It's good you noticed the swelling. The tenderness and swelling, combined with your other symptoms, warrant further investigation. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your lower extremities, just to rule out any neurological involvement. Reflexes are normal, and strength is good bilaterally. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to check your inflammatory markers, kidney function, and liver function. We also need to order a complete blood count to look for any signs of infection or anemia. And I think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be helpful to get a better look at what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… a CT scan… Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. Though, I must admit, I’m a little apprehensive. I don’t particularly enjoy medical procedures, you see. But I understand it’s necessary. And… I trust your judgment. Will the CT scan require any… contrast dye? I’ve heard stories about allergic reactions. And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know what’s going on as soon as possible. I apologize for all the questions. I just… I’m very anxious.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. It’s natural to be anxious. The CT scan will likely require intravenous contrast dye to get a clearer image. We will take all necessary precautions to minimize the risk of an allergic reaction, including pre-medicating you with antihistamines if necessary. And we will closely monitor you during and after the procedure. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. And I'll give you a referral to a gastroenterologist, as they are the specialists best equipped to diagnose and treat abdominal pain. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… like a good plan. Pain reliever… gastroenterologist… I appreciate your thoroughness. And… thank you for being so patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient. I apologize for being so vague and forgetful. But… I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… less anxious now. Is there anything else I should do before my appointment with the gastroenterologist? Any specific dietary restrictions or… anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. And you are not difficult at all. It’s my job to be patient and understanding. For now, I recommend sticking to a bland diet to avoid irritating your digestive system. Avoid fatty, fried, or spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages. And stay well hydrated. We’ll discuss any further dietary restrictions with the gastroenterologist. I'll have the lab order and CT scan request sent to the front desk, and they’ll schedule those for you. And here’s a prescription for hydrocodone for the pain. Take as directed, and please let me know if it's not providing adequate relief. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve been wonderfully helpful. And… thank you again for your patience. I feel much better prepared now. I truly appreciate your kindness. I suppose… I’ll see you when the test results are back? Thank you, Doctor Galena. You’ve been a… a comfort. Oh, and… thank you for remembering my name. It’s Alese Glymph.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. It was my pleasure. And yes, I remember. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. Take care now, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: .
