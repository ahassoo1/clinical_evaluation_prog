DOCTOR: Hello Kahrin, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Results discussion, right? Look, I’m really swamped with work, so if we could just jump straight to it, that’d be great. I remember scheduling this specifically to go over those tests from last week.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kahrin. No problem at all. Let me just pull up your results here… Last week… yes, here we are. It seems you had some bloodwork and a basic metabolic panel done on July 26th. Hmm… everything looks mostly within normal ranges, thankfully. But I do see a slightly elevated… creatinine level. It's not dramatically high, but enough for us to take a closer look. Do you recall why you had those tests done in the first place?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. My work insisted on it as part of a new health thing they're pushing. Said it was routine. I just went and got it done. I don’t usually keep track of stuff like that unless something feels wrong, you know? Creatinine… is that bad?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s common to not remember the specifics when it’s a workplace requirement. Creatinine can be an indicator of how well your kidneys are functioning. A slightly elevated level doesn't automatically mean there's a problem, but it's good we're looking into it. Do you have any known kidney issues, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about your kidney health before?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I eat okay, I try to stay active… I mean, work is stressful, but physically I’m fine. This is… surprising. Is it something I should be really worried about? I've got deadlines looming, and honestly, a hospital stay would be a disaster right now.
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions about a hospital stay, Kahrin. That’s definitely not the first step. It’s good you're generally healthy, that's a positive sign. A lot of things can cause a slight elevation in creatinine – dehydration, a high-protein diet, even strenuous exercise. To get a better picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. First, how much water would you say you drink in a typical day?
PATIENT: Um… probably not enough? I drink coffee, lots of coffee, to get through the day, and I usually have a soda with lunch. Water… maybe two or three glasses? I know, I know, I should drink more. It just doesn't occur to me. Does that matter a lot? I'm terrible at remembering to drink water.
DOCTOR: It can definitely play a role, Kahrin. Coffee and soda can be dehydrating, and staying adequately hydrated is important for kidney function. We'll keep that in mind. Your weight is listed as 124 pounds and your height as 164 centimeters – that puts your BMI in a healthy range. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I’m usually good about avoiding medication if I can. I get the occasional headache, but I just try to rest it out, or have some tea. I don’t take vitamins or anything like that either. I really try to keep it natural, if that makes sense. So, is this creatinine thing serious? What happens next? I really need to know if I can just keep working.
DOCTOR: It’s good you generally avoid medications, Kahrin. As for the creatinine, it's not necessarily serious at this point, but it's something we need to investigate further to rule out anything concerning. Given your work schedule and preference for a natural approach, I’d like to start with a simple repeat blood test in about a week. This will help us see if the level has changed. At the same time, I'd strongly recommend increasing your water intake significantly – aim for at least eight glasses a day. It might seem minor, but it can make a big difference. I'm also going to ask you to keep a brief log of your fluid intake for the next week, just to get a more accurate idea of how much you're currently drinking. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Eight glasses... okay, I can try. A week, another blood test... and the water log. That sounds… manageable. I guess. I just really hope this doesn't turn into something huge. I've got too much on my plate as it is. Is there anything else I need to do? Any specific foods to avoid? I don't want to mess around with my diet if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think any specific dietary changes are needed right now, Kahrin. For the most part, you can continue with your current diet. We're primarily focusing on hydration at this stage. And to reiterate, this is just a precautionary measure. I’m going to give you a form for the blood test, along with a simple chart to track your fluid intake. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms – like changes in urination, swelling in your legs or ankles, or fatigue – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Forms and a log. I can handle that. No unusual symptoms… I’ll keep an eye out. Thank you, Dr. Finco. I appreciate you not making a huge deal out of it, and for keeping it simple. I’ve really got to get back to work now, so… I think that’s everything? .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kahrin. I understand you’re busy, and we’ll keep things as straightforward as possible. Just remember to stay hydrated and keep an eye out for anything unusual. Yes, I think that’s everything for today. Please let the receptionist know if you need help scheduling the follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions.
