DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you could just get right to it? I have a pretty tight schedule.
DOCTOR: Of course. However, before I simply “get right to it,” as you put it, it’s standard procedure to review why those tests were ordered in the first place. It helps ensure I’m presenting the information in the most useful context. It’s quite important. Now, can you remind me what symptoms led you to schedule the appointment initially?
PATIENT: Look, I remember telling the nurse when I booked it, and again when I filled out the forms. Honestly? Just… really tired all the time. And a bit shaky. That's it. I don't see why we need to rehash everything. Is that what these results are about? Because if it's nothing serious, I'd really like to know now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your intake forms note fatigue and tremors. However, those are rather broad complaints, Ms. Kovtun, and could indicate a multitude of possibilities. I need a more detailed history to properly interpret the lab results. "Shaky" is… subjective. Are we talking occasional hand tremors, or something more consistent?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It's more… consistent. Like, when I’m trying to do something precise. Writing, holding a cup… even sometimes just trying to eat. It’s not constant shaking, but it happens enough to be annoying. And the tiredness… it’s like I haven’t slept in days, even when I have. Does that help? Honestly, I’m not sure what else to say. I just feel… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Off” is… still vague, but we're getting somewhere. Is this tremor worsened by stress, caffeine, or anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Stress… yeah, probably. Work’s been hectic. And I do drink coffee, a couple of cups in the morning. I hadn’t really connected the two, to be honest. But, yeah, when I’m stressed, or after I’ve had coffee, it seems worse. Is that… a bad thing? Look, I just want to know what the tests showed, Doctor. What’s going on?
DOCTOR: Very well. Your complete blood count was within normal limits, ruling out anemia as a primary cause of your fatigue. Your thyroid panel was also unremarkable. However, your Vitamin D level is quite low. Significantly low, in fact. And your glucose was slightly elevated – not diagnostic of diabetes, but warrants further investigation. Do you have any family history of diabetes, Ms. Kovtun?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Not that I know of. My mom’s side… maybe? But nobody ever talked about it much. And Vitamin D… what does that even do? I live outside, I’m practically at the beach every weekend. I thought you got Vitamin D from the sun. What does low Vitamin D have to do with anything? And what does “further investigation” mean? More tests?
DOCTOR: Yes, you do obtain Vitamin D from sunlight, Ms. Kovtun, but many factors influence absorption – skin pigmentation, time of day, sunscreen use… it’s not a simple equation. Low Vitamin D can contribute to fatigue, muscle weakness, and even exacerbate tremors. Now, regarding the slightly elevated glucose… it could be a temporary fluctuation, a result of dehydration or a recent meal. However, we need to rule out pre-diabetes or early-stage diabetes. “Further investigation” means a fasting glucose test and an A1C test – it provides a broader picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past three months. I’d also like to order a repeat Vitamin D test to confirm the initial result.
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Seriously? Okay, fine. But can we do them quickly? I really don't have time to be coming back here all the time. And… are we talking about needles? Because I hate needles. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll get it over with. Will I need to fast for the glucose test?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for the glucose test – at least eight hours beforehand. Water is permitted. As for the blood draw… yes, it does involve a needle. It’s a standard procedure, Ms. Kovtun. I understand you dislike needles, but it’s a necessary step in obtaining accurate diagnostic information. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the order sent over immediately. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed?
PATIENT: No, no more questions. Just… send the order. And make the appointment for as early next week as possible, okay? Please. I really need to get back to work. This is taking up way too much of my day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The order has been sent, and I’ve scheduled you for Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Please arrive fifteen minutes early to complete any necessary paperwork. Have a… productive day. .
