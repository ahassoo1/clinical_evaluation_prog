DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a delicate matter, truthfully. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things progress any further. One can’t be too careful these days, you know.
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health. So, to clarify, you're wanting a general health screening before becoming more sexually active with a new partner?
PATIENT: Well, "sexually active" is rather… blunt, Doctor. Let's just say I'm exploring a potential long-term commitment. And yes, a thorough check-up is exactly what I’m after. I need to be certain I’m not bringing any… unpleasantness into a new relationship. It’s quite embarrassing to even discuss, honestly. I do hope you have experience with… people like me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand. “Exploring a potential long-term commitment” is perfectly fine phrasing, and I assure you, discretion and sensitivity are very important to me. And yes, I have plenty of experience providing preventative care for patients in similar situations. We’ll get through this. Let's start with some basic information. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be regarding those things. My husband usually handles all the scheduling. It was… two, maybe three years ago? Perhaps with Dr. Abernathy? He was a bit… rough around the edges, if I recall correctly, but competent enough, I suppose. I'm not sure what exactly was covered, truthfully. A general overview, I presume.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three years ago with Dr. Abernathy. That’s helpful. We'll likely want to repeat some of those tests, just to be certain, and update everything. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I was diagnosed with hypertension about fifteen years ago, but it’s well-managed with medication. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. I also had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis last winter, but I recovered fully. Oh, and my mother had type 2 diabetes, if that’s relevant. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I do watch my diet, you know. I simply must maintain a certain standard.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with Lisinopril, bronchitis last winter, and a family history of type 2 diabetes. Thank you. Any surgeries in the past, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. It was quite bothersome, a constant ache. And… hmm. No, I don’t believe anything else. No broken bones, no unexpected incidents. I am, thankfully, quite careful. It was a very routine procedure, if I recall. The recovery wasn't pleasant, but Dr. Reynolds assured me everything went smoothly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago. Good to know. And you mentioned your mother had type 2 diabetes. Do you know if anyone else in your family has any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away when I was quite young, actually. And my sister has… arthritis, I believe. It's in her hands, mostly. She complains incessantly about it, but truthfully, I think she enjoys the attention. It’s quite tiresome, really. Apart from that, no. Everyone else seems remarkably healthy, for their age. Though, my aunt Mildred does have a rather persistent cough… but I doubt that’s anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart disease, sister with arthritis. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril, Doctor. And a daily multivitamin, of course. One must keep one’s vitamins up. And occasionally, an ibuprofen for a headache. But that’s hardly regular, you understand. I truly try to avoid relying on those things. It’s so much better to rest, if possible. Though, that rarely happens with my schedule.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril daily, multivitamin, and occasional ibuprofen. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Though, I find certain perfumes give me a headache. But that's hardly an allergy, you understand. A sensitivity, perhaps? And I am… not fond of shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not a medical issue. I truly believe I’m remarkably resilient, Doctor. I rarely get sick.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? I assure you, I lead a very respectable life. I do not smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner on occasion – a Pinot Grigio, preferably – but that is hardly excessive. And as for recreational drugs... the very idea! I am a churchgoing woman, Doctor. I find your questions rather… impertinent.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Pandolfi. I assure you, no offense was intended. These are standard questions I ask all my patients to get a complete picture of their health. It’s simply part of my due diligence. Perhaps I phrased them poorly. Let me rephrase. Do you have any concerns about your sexual health?
PATIENT: Well, that's a more appropriate question, Doctor. As I mentioned, I am exploring a potential long-term commitment. One must be… cautious. I haven’t been with anyone for quite some time, and frankly, I wouldn’t know where to begin concerning… testing. That is precisely why I’m here, isn’t it? To ensure everything is… up to standard. I suppose I'm concerned about… everything. STDs, of course. And just… general well-being. One can’t be too careful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. You're very right to be proactive. We can certainly discuss STD screening, and I'll explain the process and the tests involved. Before that, I’d like to do a brief physical exam - just to get a baseline. That includes checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic abdominal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I suppose that's necessary. Though, I must warn you, I am rather sensitive. Please be gentle. And I do hope this won't take too long. I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, you see. With the ladies from the garden club. They're quite particular about punctuality.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll do my best to keep things brief. Let's start with your blood pressure. If you could just extend your arm, please. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs... Heart sounds are regular with no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen... Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. No masses or organomegaly appreciated.
PATIENT: Oh, that's a little… firm, isn’t it? I had a rather large salad for lunch yesterday, you see. With a vinaigrette dressing. Perhaps that's it? And I do believe I’m feeling a little… gassy. But overall, I suppose that sounds… satisfactory. Now, about those tests. What exactly will be involved? And will they be… uncomfortable? I truly dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, a large salad can sometimes cause a little firmness. And the gas is understandable. Now, regarding the tests, we’ll need to do a complete blood count to check your general health, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a urine analysis. For sexually transmitted infections, we’ll do a blood test to screen for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B and C. We'll also need a swab test to screen for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and trichomoniasis. The blood draw will involve a small prick with a needle, but it's usually very quick. As for the swab test, it may be slightly uncomfortable, but it's brief. I will be as gentle as possible. Do you have any questions about any of those tests, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Goodness. That sounds… rather extensive, doesn’t it? And a swab test? Oh dear. I suppose it’s necessary, if you insist. But you simply must be careful. And what about… everything else? I mean, are there any other tests I should be considering? One hears such terrible things these days. And is there any way to… expedite the process? I really mustn’t be late for my luncheon. Mrs. Abernathy is terribly strict about these things. And frankly, I’m rather anxious about all this poking and prodding. It’s all so… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Pandolfi. It is a comprehensive panel, but it’s the most thorough way to ensure your health and well-being. We can certainly discuss tailoring it based on your specific risk factors. Since you mentioned exploring a long-term relationship, I recommend adding a Herpes Simplex Virus test – it’s often asymptomatic, so testing is important. Regarding expediting the process, I’ll make sure the lab prioritizes your samples. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they come in. Now, are you allergic to latex?
PATIENT: Latex? Oh dear. I haven't the faintest idea. I believe my husband handles all the… medical supplies. I simply go along for the ride, so to speak. I don't recall any specific reactions to… gloves or anything. But perhaps it's best to be cautious? Honestly, I have no idea. Can one be allergic to latex? It sounds rather… peculiar. I do hope this isn't going to delay things further. Mrs. Abernathy is simply furious when I’m late. It creates such a stir, you see. And the gossip… simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Pandolfi. We can certainly use non-latex gloves as a precaution. It's always best to be safe. Okay, so we'll proceed with the complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, urine analysis, HSV test, and STI screening. I will send these orders to the lab electronically. They will contact you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw and swab test. Do you have any questions about the lab location or hours?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I suppose I can find it. It’s just… all this paperwork. And the waiting. Honestly, Doctor, it's all so very… inconvenient. Will they call me with the results? Or will I need to schedule another appointment? And will you be the one explaining everything? I do prefer to deal with familiar faces, you see. It's simply easier. I trust your judgment, of course, but… well, one can’t be too careful. Especially with these… personal matters. And will there be a cost? My husband handles all the finances, you understand. I wouldn't want to create any… complications.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand your concerns. The lab will contact you to schedule the appointment, and they will let you know the cost upfront. I will personally review your results and contact you directly to discuss them, as soon as they are available. It will be a private, one-on-one conversation, and I will explain everything in detail. You won't have to worry about any complications. Here’s a summary of the tests we’ve ordered, and my business card with my direct number. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That's… reassuring. Thank you. No, I believe that’s all for now. Though, one last thing. Do you think… it's too early to start planning a celebration? Just in case, you understand. I'm thinking a small garden party. With cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey tea. And perhaps a string quartet. But only if everything is… satisfactory, of course. One mustn’t get one’s hopes up too quickly. Thank you again for your time and… discretion. It's been… enlightening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s been a pleasure meeting you. And as for the celebration… perhaps it’s best to wait for the results, but it’s wonderful you’re already thinking positively. Please, have a wonderful day and enjoy your luncheon with the garden club. I’ll be in touch as soon as your results are available. .
