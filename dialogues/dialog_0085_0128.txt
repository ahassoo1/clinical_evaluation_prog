DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It's my joints, I think. They get so stiff in the mornings, you know? Makes it hard to get going. I don’t really remember much else, to be honest. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the mornings. That's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well... it's mostly my hands and knees, I think. And my back a little bit. It's not painful, exactly, just… tight. Like they haven't been used in a long time, even though I've been moving around. It takes a while for them to loosen up. Longer than it used to, anyway. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. You're doing just fine. It sounds like the stiffness is worse in the mornings, and it affects your hands, knees, and back. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. A while, definitely. Maybe… a few months? Or longer? It's all a bit blurry, I'm afraid. It's just gotten worse slowly, you know? Not suddenly, but… just a little bit more each day, maybe. I used to be able to do things so much easier. Now... well, now it's just a bit harder to get started in the mornings. I don't remember what started it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of gradually worsening stiffness. That's helpful. And you said it’s harder to get started in the mornings. How long does it typically take for the stiffness to ease up after you get moving?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually… about an hour or so? Sometimes longer if it’s really cold. I work with the little ones, you see, so I have to move around. It's good for them, and it does help loosen things up eventually. But the first bit is always the worst. It’s like… creaky. Do you know what I mean? Like an old door? That's how it feels.
DOCTOR: I do know exactly what you mean – the “creaky” feeling. That gives me a good idea of what we're dealing with. Now, besides the stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… Not really, I don’t think. I get tired easily, but I always have. Maybe a little more tired lately, but I figured that’s just getting older. No swelling or anything like that. And no fever or anything scary. Just the stiffness and the tiredness. Oh! And sometimes my hands feel a little numb in the morning, but it goes away pretty quickly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. So, we have stiffness in your hands, knees, and back, fatigue, and some morning numbness in your hands that resolves quickly. Have you ever had any injuries to those joints – hands, knees, or back?
PATIENT: Injuries… Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I remember, no. I’ve always been pretty careful. Maybe a few little bumps and bruises when I was younger, playing with the kids, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a doctor, anyway. I don’t recall any major falls or anything like that. I do remember twisting my ankle once when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago! I don't think that's related, though. Is it?
DOCTOR: Probably not, Lilliana. That was a long time ago. Okay, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're asking things I really don’t remember. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, I think. The doctor gave me some pills for it, and it went away. Or maybe I still take them? I honestly can’t remember. I used to have a doctor back home, but… well, things have been a bit chaotic since my husband passed. I don’t really keep track of things like that anymore, I’m afraid. I don’t think I have arthritis or anything like that. I just have this stiffness.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure. We'll definitely look into that. And it's perfectly understandable that it's hard to keep track of things during a difficult time. Do you know what medications you're currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. I take a little pill for my water retention, I think. My legs get swollen sometimes. And maybe something for my blood pressure, like I said? I really can’t be sure. I just take what the doctor tells me to take. I have a little bottle with a few pills in it, but I don't know what they are. I don’t keep track of all that stuff. I'm sorry I'm not more helpful. It's just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Lilliana. It's okay. We can figure this out together. Do you have that pill bottle with you today?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. I keep it in my purse. Here it is. It's just… a bunch of little white pills. See? No label or anything. I've been meaning to ask someone about them, but I always forget. Everything just seems to slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. This will be helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do any of your close family members have arthritis or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Let me see. My mother had some trouble with her hands when she got older, I think. Real stiff and swollen, she used to say. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had something in her knees, I remember. She had to have surgery for it. But that was a long time ago. I don't remember exactly what it was. It was just… something with her joints. Lots of pain, she said. Does that count? They’re both gone now, so I don’t have anyone to ask about it. Everything is just… memories. Fading memories.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of joint problems in your mother and aunt. That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat everything, and I haven't been stung by a bee or anything like that in years. No skin allergies either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Though, my skin is getting a little sensitive lately. But I don’t think that’s an allergy. Just getting old, probably. Is that all the questions? My mind is getting a little tired now.
DOCTOR: That was a lot of information, thank you for sharing all of that with me, Lilliana. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay. I'll just check your joints to see how they move, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds fine. Anything to help, you know? I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm a bit worried about my knees, they sometimes make a clicking sound when I bend them. Is that normal? I'm probably just rambling now. Go ahead, please. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all. That clicking sound is something we’ll definitely check out. Okay, let’s start. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table?
PATIENT: Here we go. It's a bit cold, isn't it? And a little hard. But I'll manage. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to start by examining your hands. Just relax them for me. Alright. I’m not seeing any significant swelling or redness, but there is some mild tenderness when I press here and here. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's a little sore. Not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. I feel it mostly in the mornings, like I said. When I try to make a fist, it feels a bit stiff. It’s not as easy as it used to be. I used to be able to knit for hours, but I haven't been able to do much of that lately. It's just a little bit harder now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your wrists?
PATIENT: My wrists… They don’t hurt as much as my hands, but they feel a bit achy sometimes. Especially when I’m doing things around the house. Like… washing dishes or gardening. They get tired easily, I think. I don't really pay much attention to them unless they start bothering me. There's a little clicking sound when I move them like that, but I've always had that. Is that bad? Oh dear, I'm probably just making things complicated now.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making things complicated at all. The clicking sound isn't necessarily bad. It just means there might be some wear and tear in the joint. Okay, now let’s move on to your knees. Could you please extend your legs out in front of me?
