DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, Chellsea. Just to clarify, you were recently informed of a cancer diagnosis and have been referred to me for follow-up?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I… I don’t remember exactly who told me, to be honest. It’s been a little confusing. But they said I needed to see a doctor about it, and someone gave me your name. Is this… a cancer clinic?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it can be overwhelming to process such news, and details can easily get muddled. This isn’t strictly a cancer clinic, but I do specialize in Internal Medicine and often manage patients with various complex conditions, including cancer. We will certainly get to the bottom of everything together. To start, can you recall anything specific about the type of cancer you were told about, or where in the body it is located?
PATIENT: Um… I think they said it was… in my chest? Something about my lungs, maybe? It was a long appointment, and I was… very upset. I honestly don’t remember much else. They gave me some papers, but I haven’t really looked at them yet. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Chellsea. It's completely understandable to be overwhelmed and not remember everything. Don't worry about it at all. We have access to your records here, and I can review everything from that appointment. Let me pull up your information… Ah, yes, here we are. It appears you had a chest X-ray and CT scan performed recently. The report indicates a nodule was found in your left lung. It’s described as suspicious, and further evaluation was recommended. Do you have Medicare card available?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you go. A nodule… is that bad? I don’t really know what any of this means. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Thank you. A nodule simply means a small growth. Most nodules are benign, meaning not cancerous, but it's important to investigate any suspicious findings. The scans suggested we needed to look further. As you can see here on the CT scan, this small nodule is present in the upper lobe of your left lung. The radiologist recommended a biopsy to determine exactly what it is. Have you had any symptoms, Chellsea?
PATIENT: A biopsy… that sounds… scary. Symptoms? Um… I’ve been a little tired lately, I guess. But I thought that was just from… everything. And I’ve had a cough, but it comes and goes. Nothing too bad, really. Mostly just when I lie down. Is a biopsy… painful? And what if… what if it is bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a biopsy, Chellsea. We'll discuss all of your concerns. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the nodule to be examined under a microscope, which will give us a definitive diagnosis. There are different ways to perform a biopsy, and we would choose the method that is least invasive and most comfortable for you. Regarding pain, it depends on the type of biopsy. Some biopsies are performed with local anesthesia, so you wouldn't feel much discomfort during the procedure. We will ensure you are comfortable and pain-managed appropriately. Let’s focus on getting the information we need first. Before we discuss specific biopsy options, let’s get a more complete picture of your overall health. Could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better, knowing there are options. My past medical history… well, I haven’t really had much. I was always pretty healthy. Until… this. My husband… he passed away last year. That was… difficult. I had some tests after that, because I wasn’t feeling well emotionally, but everything came back normal. Nothing physically wrong, they said. Other than that… I’ve never been hospitalized or anything. No major illnesses, no surgeries.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that it would take a toll on your well-being. It’s good to hear that you were otherwise healthy before this recent finding. Do you have any family history of cancer or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer, I think. A long time ago. She’s… she passed away years ago. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… something with his lungs. But I don’t remember exactly what. He smoked for a long time. That's all I really know. We weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. That's helpful information. Now, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to stay away from medications if I can. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Just… tea, mostly. And vitamins sometimes, when I remember. Nothing regular, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Well… I get itchy sometimes, when I’m outside, but I think that’s just from the pollen. I don't have any serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. Now, to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… um… well, I work as an occupational therapist, so I’m pretty active during the day. I help people with their daily activities, so I’m always moving around. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard sometimes, with my work schedule. I like to garden when I have time, and I enjoy spending time with my friends. Not much else, really.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very fulfilling life, Chellsea. It’s good to hear that you’re active and health-conscious. Okay, based on everything you've told me, and the initial imaging reports, it appears we are dealing with a nodule in your left lung that requires further investigation. As we discussed, a biopsy is the next step. I’d like to discuss the different biopsy options available to you. Would you prefer a bronchoscopy, a needle biopsy, or a surgical biopsy?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. That’s a lot of choices. I… I don’t know anything about those. Which one is… least invasive? And… which one is the most accurate? I’m scared, Doctor. I don’t want to do anything… too drastic.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel scared, Chellsea. It’s a lot to take in, and it’s good you’re asking questions. Let me explain the options. A bronchoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your airways to visualize the nodule and collect a sample. It’s relatively minimally invasive, but it doesn’t always get a sample directly from the nodule, especially if it’s small or located deep within the lung. A needle biopsy involves inserting a needle through your chest wall to collect a sample. It’s also minimally invasive, and can often get a more direct sample, but there's a small risk of collapsing the lung. A surgical biopsy involves a small incision to remove a piece of the nodule. It’s the most accurate option, but it’s also the most invasive, and requires more recovery time. Given your description, and the fact that the nodule is relatively new, I would recommend a bronchoscopy as the first step. It’s the least invasive option, and can often provide enough information for a diagnosis. If the bronchoscopy is inconclusive, we can then consider a needle biopsy. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: A bronchoscopy… okay. That sounds… less scary than surgery. But you said it doesn’t always get a good sample? What if it doesn’t? Then what happens? And… what does it feel like? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea. You’re right to ask. A bronchoscopy doesn't always get a definitive sample, but it's the best initial approach. If the initial sample isn’t sufficient, we can repeat the procedure with additional techniques or, as we discussed, move onto a needle biopsy, which, as I mentioned, is still less invasive than surgery. As for what it feels like… you’ll be given medication to help you relax and may be sedated during the procedure. You’ll likely feel some pressure in your throat and chest, but it shouldn’t be painful. Some people experience a slight cough or sore throat afterwards, but that usually resolves quickly. We’ll monitor you closely throughout the procedure and provide pain relief if needed. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. What happens exactly? And how long does it take? And… what if something goes wrong?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You'll be asked to lie on your side. We’ll administer medication through an IV to help you relax and may give you local anesthetic spray to numb your nose and throat. A thin, flexible tube called a bronchoscope will be inserted through your nose or mouth and guided into your airways. We'll then use small instruments to collect tissue samples from the nodule. Throughout the procedure, we’ll monitor your oxygen levels and heart rate. As for risks… like any medical procedure, there are some potential risks, but they are relatively rare. These can include bleeding, infection, or, very rarely, collapsed lung. We take every precaution to minimize these risks, and our team is experienced in managing any complications that may arise. We’ll have the necessary equipment and personnel on standby. We will review these risks and obtain your consent before proceeding. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: What about after the procedure? Can I go home? Will I be able to work? And… will I know right away what’s going on?
DOCTOR: Good questions. Typically, you will be able to go home the same day, but you'll need someone to drive you, as you'll be groggy from the medication. You’ll likely feel some fatigue and may have a mild sore throat, but you should be able to resume most of your normal activities within a day or two, although strenuous activity will be limited for a week. As for knowing the results, we'll send the tissue samples to a pathologist for analysis. It usually takes a few days to a week to get the results back. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail and determine the best course of action. We'll be with you every step of the way, Chellsea. We will do everything we can to ensure you receive the best possible care. Before we schedule the procedure, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. It’s… a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing what to expect. When can we schedule the bronchoscopy?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help clarify things for you. Let me check the schedule… We have an opening next Tuesday afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Tuesday afternoon would be fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It’s my pleasure. My team will contact you with instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before Tuesday. In the meantime, I will order a full blood count and metabolic panel. I will also ask the radiology department to send me the complete scans for my review. Do you have any questions before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor. I'll see you Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. We’ll take good care of you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on Tuesday. .
