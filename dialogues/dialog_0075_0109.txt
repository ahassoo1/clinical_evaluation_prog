DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for, oh… maybe three days now. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know? Not a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I was working… at the rail yard, like always. Been working there… a long, long time. Dinkey operator, mostly. Moving the little cars around. It started… I think after I lifted a… a heavy piece of metal. Not too heavy, but… heavier than I usually lift. Didn't think much of it at first. Just thought my neck was sore. But the ache… it stayed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started after lifting something at work, while you were operating the dinkey at the rail yard. And it's been persistent for three days now. When you say "heavy," can you estimate how much weight you think it was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight… I don't know weights, Doctor. I just know heavy. Maybe… like a big engine part? Not the whole engine, but… a piece of it. Big and… square. Maybe… fifty, sixty pounds? I don't know! I really don't know weights. I just know it made my arms feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately fifty to sixty pounds, and it made your arms feel tired. That’s helpful. Do you feel any pain radiating from the back of your head down your neck, or into your shoulders?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not much, but… sometimes. Down my neck, mostly. And… a little bit in my left shoulder. Not a bad pain, just… a feeling. Like it’s tight. Like a muscle that needs to be stretched.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some tightness and radiating pain down your neck and into your left shoulder. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache and neck pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I sleep okay. Eat okay. Maybe a little tired, but I am old! I get tired easy, you know? No blurry vision. No dizziness. No… what do you call it… ringing in the ears? No, nothing like that. Just the ache… and the tightness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, blurry vision, or ringing in the ears. Just the headache and tightness. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. Old age, I guess! <chuckles softly> No… no serious sicknesses. I had the flu, a few times, when I was younger. And… my wife, she passed away last year. But that was… not a sickness. Just… old age for her too. I haven’t been to the doctor in… oh, a long time.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. So, no significant past medical history, and you haven’t seen a doctor recently. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never needed any. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just… bumps and bruises over the years. Working at the rail yard, you get a few of those. But nothing serious enough for a surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything. Take any medicine. Never had a problem with allergies. My wife… she had a little trouble with pollen, in the spring, but I never did.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medicines. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to. Just… a little something for my knees sometimes, when they bother me. But that's just when they really bother me. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just something occasionally for your knees. Alright, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and then I’d like to examine your neck and shoulders. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. My neck and shoulders are a little stiff. I'm happy to let you look at them. Just be gentle, okay? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be very gentle. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/82, and your pulse is 76 and regular. Now, if you could please turn your head slowly to the left… and then to the right… excellent. And now, I’m going to gently palpate your neck muscles. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. How does that feel?
PATIENT: That… feels a little sore, Doctor. Right there. <points to the muscles on the left side of his neck> And a little bit… tight. Like a knot. Not a bad pain, just… uncomfortable. When you press on it, it feels… achy. Like I’ve been working too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness and tightness on the left side of your neck, with an achy feeling when palpated. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your shoulders. Can you please lift your right arm straight up in front of you, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this? It… feels a little tight. Not a sharp pain, just… a stretching feeling. I can’t lift it all the way up like I used to. It feels… stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited range of motion with a feeling of tightness. And now, can you rotate your shoulders backwards, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… tighter on this side. <points to his left shoulder> Feels… stuck again. Not a bad pain, just… doesn’t move as easy as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion and tightness on the left shoulder. Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing muscle strain and tension in your neck and shoulders, likely aggravated by the lifting at work. It’s common with your line of work. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, Doctor. That… makes sense. I do lift a lot at the rail yard. And it is hard work. So, muscle strain… is that… serious? Will I need… pills? I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not usually serious, Mr. Brum. It’s a common injury, and most people recover with conservative treatment. As for pills, we can certainly avoid them if possible. I recommend starting with some gentle stretching exercises, applying heat to the area, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if needed. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, then we can consider other options. Do you have any limitations at work that would prevent you from modifying how you lift?
PATIENT: Well… no, not really. I can try to lift lighter things, I guess. But everything at the rail yard is… heavy. I've been doing the same job for so long, I don't know how to change it. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to change things after doing them for a long time. Let’s start with the stretching and heat, and see if that helps. I’m going to write down a few simple exercises for you, and I can provide you with a referral to a physical therapist if you feel you would benefit from more individualized guidance. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be good. A physical therapist… maybe they can show me how to lift things the right way. And some exercises would be good. I'll try to do them every day. I don't want to have to stop working, you know? I need to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. Here are those exercises. And I'll also write a referral for you to see a physical therapist. They can assess your specific needs and develop a tailored program. In the meantime, if the pain worsens, or if you experience any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. Thank you very much. You've been very helpful. And thank you for the exercises and the referral. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body and don't push yourself too hard. We want to get you feeling better and keep you working safely. Here is the referral and the exercises. Please call our office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. <shakes your hand gently> I will. And I will try to take it easy. Bye bye.
