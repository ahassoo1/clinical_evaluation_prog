DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you too. Um… chronic fatigue, they said? That’s what the… the lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, it feels like I’ve been tired forever. I just… want to feel normal again, you know? It’s hard to keep track of things these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Chronic fatigue” is a broad term, and it’s good you’re seeking answers. It is frustrating when you’re feeling tired all the time. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. When you say “forever”, can you give me a rough idea of how long you've been feeling significantly fatigued?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough idea… hmm. It’s been… well, after my husband passed, it got worse. That was… five years ago? Maybe six? Time just… slips away. Before that, I was always busy, you know? Work, the house… I didn’t really notice being tired then. But now… now it’s all I notice. It’s…constant. I don’t even remember what it feels like to not be tired, really. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Licano. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and grief can definitely manifest physically, including causing persistent fatigue. It's not surprising that it's taken a toll on your energy levels. So, it sounds like the fatigue was more pronounced after your husband’s passing, about five or six years ago. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Pretty constant, I think. There are… some days that are worse than others, naturally. But it’s always there. Like… a weight. It’s not like I can just… shake it off. And it’s not just being sleepy, you know? It’s… everything feels harder. Even simple things. I used to love gardening, but now… I can barely get through an hour before I have to sit down. And then I feel guilty for sitting down! It's… a mess. I don't know. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Licano. You’re describing exactly what I need to know. It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life, and it’s not just about feeling sleepy. It’s affecting your ability to enjoy things you used to love, and even simple tasks are becoming challenging. Okay. Let's try to get a bit more specific. Besides the gardening, what other activities are being affected by this fatigue?
PATIENT: Ugh… everything, really. I used to volunteer at the library, but I had to stop. Couldn't concentrate. And… honestly, even keeping the house tidy is a struggle. I used to be so proud of my home. Now it just… feels overwhelming. Cooking… forget about it. I mostly just… eat simple things, or… well, sometimes I don't eat enough. My daughter, she worries about me. She keeps bringing me soup. It’s…embarrassing. And… I forget things. Appointments, what I was saying mid-sentence…little things. It's getting worse, I think. Oh, and… socializing. I used to love getting together with friends, but now I just… cancel. Too tired to even think about it.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this is really impacting many areas of your life, and I appreciate you sharing all of that with me. It's good that your daughter is looking out for you. It's definitely concerning when fatigue starts to affect memory and concentration. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to ask you a few questions, if that's alright. We call this a review of systems. I’ll just ask about different body systems to see if anything else might be contributing to how you're feeling. First, have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Questions are fine. Um… fever? Not that I can recall. Maybe a little bit achy sometimes, but not a proper fever. And weight loss… yes, actually. I think so. My clothes are… looser than they used to be. I haven't weighed myself recently, but my daughter commented on it last time she visited. She said I look… thinner. I don’t really have much of an appetite anymore, so that makes sense, I guess. I just don't feel hungry. It’s… strange.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. And any muscle aches or joint pain along with that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My shoulders, especially. And my knees. They ache when I go up and down the stairs. I just thought it was… getting old. I used to be able to do anything, and now… everything feels like work. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. And it's worse in the mornings, usually. Before I get moving, everything just feels…stiff. And tired, of course. Everything feels tired. Sorry. I'm probably just stating the obvious.
DOCTOR: You're not stating the obvious at all, Ms. Licano. You’re providing me with important details. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… hmm. That’s… a personal question, isn't it? Well, things are… irregular. Sometimes I’m constipated, sometimes… the opposite. It’s been… unpredictable, I guess. And I haven’t really paid much attention to it, to be honest. It’s just another thing. It's all connected, I think. The tiredness makes everything worse, and everything makes the tiredness worse. It's a vicious cycle. I’m sorry, I’m rambling again. This is probably too much information.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling, and it’s important information. Irregular bowel habits can definitely be a clue. Alright, one more question about your body systems for now. Have you noticed any changes in your skin – any rashes, dryness, or unusual bruising?
PATIENT: Oh. No, not really. My skin is… dry, maybe? I always have to use lotion in the winter. But no rashes, no bruising… nothing like that. It’s just… old skin, I guess. It's lost some of its… elasticity. That's probably all. I haven't noticed anything unusual. Honestly, I just try not to look at myself in the mirror too much these days. It's… depressing. Everything feels like it's falling apart, and my skin is just… another reminder. I’m sorry. This is just… a lot. I don’t even know why I’m telling you all of this. It probably doesn’t even matter.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, it does matter. You’re being incredibly open, and all of this is helping me get a better understanding of what you're going through. It sounds like you're not just dealing with physical fatigue, but also some emotional distress. Okay. Let's shift gears a little bit. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… um… well, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. That was…okay, I guess. A little painful afterwards, but nothing major. And… I had pneumonia when I was younger, a long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was 45. That was…difficult. But I recovered, eventually. Nothing else… I don't think so. Honestly, my memory is just… terrible. I always have to ask my daughter to remind me of things. She keeps all my medical records. She's a good girl. I'm probably forgetting something important. It’s just… hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about forgetting things. That’s what medical records are for! It's good your daughter helps you with that. The hysterectomy is important to note, thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild allergy. Nothing serious. And no allergies to medications… as far as I can remember. I’ve taken so many pills over the years, I can barely keep track of them. My daughter knows all of that. She's very careful. She always checks with the pharmacist before I take anything new. She worries about me, you know? She's a good girl. I’m probably just stating the obvious. I'm rambling again. Sorry. This is…a lot. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask at all, Ms. Licano, and you’re not rambling. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when you're dealing with a lot. And it’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter. Okay, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I take… a blood pressure pill, once a day. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my aches and pains, when they're really bad. And… a multivitamin, occasionally. My daughter brings me those. She says I need them. And… that's it, I think. Honestly, I try to take as little medication as possible. I don’t like feeling… doped up. It makes me feel worse, sometimes. And… I'm terrible at remembering to take them. I forget things, you know? It’s just… a mess. Sorry. I’m probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Ms. Licano. Thank you. Knowing about the lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen is helpful. Now, to get a complete picture, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had… diabetes, I think. And my father had… heart problems. He died when he was fairly young, from a heart attack. And… my sister has arthritis, really bad arthritis. She can barely walk. And… that’s it, I think. As far as I know. My family wasn’t really… healthy. A lot of early deaths. It’s… depressing to think about. But I try not to dwell on it. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? Sorry. I’m rambling again. This is…a lot. I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask, Ms. Licano. Knowing about the diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis in your family is important. Finally, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, since my husband passed. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but… it doesn't feel right anymore. And… drugs? Absolutely not! I’m a good Romanian girl, you know? I just want to feel better, that’s all. I just want my life back. Is that too much to ask? Sorry. I'm rambling again. This is…a lot. I just want to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: No, it's not too much to ask at all, and you aren’t rambling. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Licano. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your situation now. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing persistent fatigue for several years, particularly after the loss of your husband. This fatigue is impacting many areas of your life, and it's accompanied by other symptoms like muscle aches, weight loss, irregular bowel habits, and difficulty with concentration and memory. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general assessment. It'll help me get a better sense of what might be going on.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. But… yes, alright. Go ahead. I just… want to know what’s wrong with me. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to feel better. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. That could be related to reduced activity. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. It’s soft, but a little tender in the lower right quadrant. No masses or enlargement. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Okay. Everything seems generally normal, but the diminished breath sounds and tenderness in your abdomen warrant further investigation. Given your history, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, or even early signs of heart failure. We’ll need to do some blood work to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work? Honestly, I hate needles. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. What exactly will they be looking for? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what’s wrong with me. Is that too much to ask? I just want my life back.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to dislike needles, Ms. Licano. It's a common fear. We’ll need to draw a relatively small amount of blood, and it should be quick. We’ll be looking at a complete blood count to check for anemia, thyroid function tests to see if your thyroid is working properly, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and vitamin levels, including Vitamin D and B12. We’ll also check your inflammatory markers just to rule out anything more serious. The results usually take about 3-5 business days, depending on the lab. As soon as we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some gentle exercise, if you’re able. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. And make sure you're staying hydrated and eating a balanced diet. I know it’s hard when you don’t have much appetite, but try to eat small, frequent meals. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Small, frequent meals… That’s easier said than done. Everything feels like such an effort. Three to five business days… alright. I guess I can wait. No… no questions right now. I just… I just want to know what’s wrong. And I want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? I think… I think that’s all. Maybe. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Ms. Licano, and I understand your eagerness to find answers. I’ll get the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for a blood draw. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, such as if you develop a fever, chest pain, or severe shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll also have my nurse print out some information on fatigue management and some resources for emotional support. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I promise. Do you have any trouble walking to your car, or would you like me to call someone to help you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I’m alright. I can walk. I just… need to get home. I just want to lie down. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. I think… I think I’m okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Licano. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch soon.
