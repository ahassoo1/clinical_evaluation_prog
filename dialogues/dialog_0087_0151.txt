DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, please, call me Teretha. It’s… well, it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought I should probably get it checked out. I'd like to get this over with quickly if that’s alright, I have a route to finish today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. We’ll do our best to be efficient. Tingling in the hands…and how long has “a little while” been, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… about three weeks, maybe a month? It comes and goes. Some days it’s hardly noticeable, and other days it’s… well, annoying is a good word. Especially when I’m sorting mail! It makes it harder to feel what I’m doing, you know? It's mostly in my fingers and palms.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a month, intermittent, primarily in the fingers and palms, and impacting your ability to sort mail. Does anything specific seem to trigger the tingling, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it…cold weather definitely makes it worse. And… when I’m really stressed, like if the truck is running late or there’s a problem with a delivery. Stress just seems to… amplify it, I guess. Otherwise, it just happens randomly. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. Cold and stress are both potential triggers. Do you experience any pain along with the tingling, or is it strictly a sensory change?
PATIENT: Just the tingling, mostly. Sometimes it feels a little… achy, but not really painful. It’s more like an uncomfortable… buzzing, if that makes sense. And it's not constant, like I said. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely been more frequent lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily tingling and occasionally a mild ache, more frequent recently. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That's a good question. I haven't noticed any, but… I carry a lot of mail, you know? My hands are always tired at the end of the day. It's hard to tell if it's just from the work, or if it's something else. I haven’t dropped anything, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. No dropped items. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s it, really. No diabetes, no arthritis… the doctor checked my thyroid once, a long time ago, and said it was fine. I don't take any regular medications, just an occasional pain reliever for a headache. And I’m not insured, so I don’t go to the doctor unless I really need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal years ago, otherwise healthy, no regular medications, and no known thyroid issues. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was Ukrainian, you know. We eat a lot of… well, never mind. That's probably not important. No allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any recent injuries to your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. I bumped my wrist a couple of times getting out of the truck, but nothing serious. Just a little ouch, and it went away pretty quickly. I’ve been a mail carrier for… oh, goodness, almost 30 years. I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises, but nothing that’s bothered me for more than a day or two.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injuries. All right, Teretha, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and wrists. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. The quicker we get this done, the better. I really need to get back to my route. Just let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and wrists. And I’ll just take a look at your hands for any visible signs of swelling or redness. I’m going to press here… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. A little… pressure, maybe, but not pain. It feels… normal. Like when you push on your muscles, you know? I’ve been working with my hands for so long, I’m used to a little bit of pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you rotate your wrists for me, both directions?
PATIENT: There… that one feels a little stiff. Especially on this side. . It’s not painful, just… doesn’t move as smoothly as the other one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch your fingers?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. And that one too. They feel… normal. A little tingly, maybe, but I always have a little bit of tingling, you know? It’s hard to tell what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. And lastly, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. Hmm. Your reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, but not dramatically so. Alright, Teretha. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome, possibly with some mild arthritis contributing to the stiffness. The diminished reflexes could be related to that as well, or just normal variation. However, to be certain, I'd like to order some nerve conduction studies. These tests can help us determine if there's compression of the median nerve in your carpal tunnel. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Nerve… what now? Oh, goodness. Sounds complicated. And expensive, probably. I don’t have insurance, you know. Is it… necessary? Can’t we just… figure something else out? Maybe a brace or something? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Teretha. It’s a valid point. The nerve conduction studies would help us pinpoint the exact cause of your symptoms and rule out other possibilities. They’re the most accurate way to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. A brace can provide some temporary relief, and we can certainly try that as a first step. However, without a diagnosis, we're just treating symptoms, not the underlying problem. There are some financial assistance programs available for diagnostic testing, and I can have my office staff look into those options for you. If the testing is unaffordable, we can manage your symptoms with a brace, exercises, and activity modification. For now, I recommend a wrist brace, especially when you’re doing repetitive tasks like sorting mail. I’ll also give you some exercises you can do to strengthen your wrist muscles and improve flexibility. Would you like me to write you a prescription for a brace and give you a handout with those exercises?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A brace sounds good. And the exercises… if they’re not too complicated. I'm not very good with… fancy stuff. I just want to be able to finish my route without my hands tingling all the time. If you could check on those financial assistance things, that would be great too. But don't go to too much trouble, okay? I don’t want you wasting your time on my account.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. No trouble at all. My office staff will look into those programs for you. Here’s the prescription for a wrist brace. You can take this to any pharmacy. And here’s a handout with exercises you can do at home. They’re fairly simple – just gentle stretches and strengthening movements. Start slowly and don't push yourself too hard. I recommend wearing the brace during activities that aggravate your symptoms. If your symptoms don’t improve within a few weeks, or if they worsen, please come back and see me, and we can discuss further options. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate you not making me spend a lot of money on things I don't understand. I should probably get going. My supervisor is going to be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I understand the importance of getting back to work. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Get well soon, and have a safe day on your route.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
