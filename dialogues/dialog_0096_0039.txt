DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Burlingham. Now, you're 88 years young, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Eighty-eight. Feels it some days, I tell ya. But I get around. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good to hear. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, the nurse called about some numbers from my blood work. Said somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. Hyper… somethin’ or other. Didn’t quite catch it all, to be honest. Never had trouble with that before, so I figured I’d best come in and get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. It means you have high cholesterol. It’s… quite common, really. Now, have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel… normal. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m eighty-eight! I figure some tiredness comes with the territory, ya know? Nothing that stands out as bein’ different or worryin’.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had problems with high cholesterol, or heart trouble, for that matter?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My mother, she lived to be ninety-two, bless her. She was pretty healthy all her life, actually. Didn’t have a lot of aches and pains like I do. As far as I know, she didn’t have trouble with her heart. My father… he passed when I was young, from the flu, I think. Didn’t know him well enough to say one way or another. I had a brother, Sven, but we weren’t particularly close. Don't rightly know about his health either. Sorry I can’t be much help there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Just the one. For my arthritis, in my hands mostly. It's called… well, I forget the name, honestly. Little white pill. Helps take the edge off, that's all. Don't take it every day, just when it's really botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life, not that I know of. Ate all sorts of things as a kid, got into plenty of mischief, and never had a reaction. Lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, bless her soul, she smoked for a bit when she was younger, but I convinced her to quit. Bad habit, I always thought.
DOCTOR: And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner now and then. Red wine, mostly. Supposed to be good for ya, right? Not every night, mind you. Just on special occasions, or when I'm feelin' a bit low. Nothing heavy, just a small pour.
DOCTOR: And how would you describe your diet, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… pretty plain. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables, some fish when I can get it. I used to garden a lot more, but it’s hard on these old knees these days. My daughter brings me groceries, she’s a good girl. We eat a lot of… casseroles, I suppose. And soup. I like soup. Not much fried food, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead. I've had plenty of doctors poke and prod at me over the years. It's just part of gettin' old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds… a little distant, but regular rhythm. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Blood pressure is 140/90. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, normal bowel sounds. No palpable masses. Now, your weight is 108 pounds. That’s… quite low for your height. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s right, I’ve always been a bit on the thin side. But you’re right, I have lost a few pounds lately. Not much, but enough that my daughter noticed. She keeps tryin’ to get me to eat more, bless her heart. I just don't have much of an appetite these days, I suppose. Things just don't taste the same as they used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Based on your blood work, your cholesterol is elevated – 240 mg/dL. Coupled with the slight weight loss and diminished appetite, I’m concerned about more than just high cholesterol. We need to rule out any underlying causes for the weight loss. I’m going to order some additional blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a CBC to check for anemia. I’m also going to schedule you for a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. It's always best to be thorough, you understand.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thorough is good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Will I need to come back for more poking and prodding, then? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a bridge game next Tuesday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are in. It usually takes about a week for the lab to get everything back to us. We'll schedule that for next week, hopefully before your bridge game. In the meantime, I'd like you to try and increase your protein intake a bit, even if you don't feel particularly hungry. Things like eggs, fish, chicken… whatever you can manage. And drink plenty of fluids. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to be certain. The nurse will give you the lab orders and schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well… no, I don’t think so. Just… will these tests take long? And will they make me feel poorly? I’ve never been good with needles, to be honest. And is there anything I should avoid eating? Should I cut out the wine, maybe?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are quite quick, Mr. Bohnett. A few pinpricks, that’s all. And no, you don't need to avoid the wine entirely, but I would recommend limiting it to one small glass with dinner, just until we get the results. As for feeling poorly… it’s unlikely. Some people feel a little tired afterward, but it's usually mild. Try not to worry about it too much. It’s a routine procedure. The nurse will explain everything in detail before she draws your blood. Now, I believe that's everything for today. I’ll see you next week. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' into things. I suppose I'll let the nurse handle the paperwork and the poking and prodding. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
