DOCTOR: Hi Hedy, welcome. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… it’s this tiredness. Just always tired. And… and I eat dirt. Not like… on purpose, exactly. It just… tastes good sometimes. Is that… is that a problem? I don’t even know why I’m here, honestly. My daughter made me come.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. It sounds like you're experiencing persistent fatigue and… a craving for dirt, which we call geophagy. It's good that you’re here, and your daughter is looking out for you. Both of those things can be signs of underlying issues, and it's definitely worth investigating. Let's start with the tiredness. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigating? Look, I work with computers, okay? Programs. Numbers. I don’t need… investigating. I just need to not be so… sleepy. It’s always been this way, kinda. Worse lately, I guess. I just… push through. Coffee helps. Lots of coffee. It doesn’t fix it, but… it lets me work. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a long-standing issue, but has gotten worse recently, and you're managing with a lot of coffee. That gives me a starting point. When you say worse, can you describe how it’s worse?
PATIENT: Ugh, how am I supposed to explain? It’s… everything takes more effort. Getting out of bed. Focusing. Even just… talking to people. Like now. It’s just… draining. Before, I could work all night and still be fine. Now, I need naps. And I hate naps. Makes me feel… groggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased effort for daily activities, feeling drained, needing naps despite disliking them and feeling groggy afterwards. That's really helpful information, Hedy. It sounds quite debilitating. Now, let's circle back to the dirt craving. How often would you say you're eating dirt?
PATIENT: Look, it’s not like I’m munching on it all day, okay? It's… when I’m outside. I garden, sometimes. And I just… taste the soil. A little bit. Doesn’t hurt anybody. My grandmother used to do it too, I think. Something about the minerals, maybe? Honestly, I don’t remember. It’s not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happens occasionally when you’re gardening, and you suspect it might be related to minerals, possibly a family habit. We’ll explore that, but it's good we’re talking about it. Let me ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other changes in your body lately?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I'm… old, okay? Things change. My knees hurt. My hair is gray. What are you looking for, exactly? I don’t have time for a full body inventory.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I'm not looking for a full inventory, just trying to get a better picture of what’s going on. Sometimes fatigue and cravings can be connected to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. Sometimes I don’t. I skip breakfast usually. Too busy. Lunch is a sandwich, mostly. And dinner… whatever my daughter makes. I'm not a picky eater. I've never really paid much attention to it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fairly inconsistent eating habits, skipping breakfast often, and generally not paying close attention to your appetite. That’s good to know. And are you drinking enough water throughout the day?
PATIENT: Water? Look, I drink coffee. That’s a liquid, isn’t it? I don’t sit around sipping water all day, no. What is this, a health check? My daughter told me you were going to ask about… symptoms. Is this what symptoms are?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a health check, Hedy, but it’s all to help understand what might be causing the tiredness and the cravings. Coffee is a liquid, but it doesn’t hydrate you the same way water does. Let's move on. Have you noticed any unusual bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Bruising? No! What are you implying? I’m not falling apart, okay? I haven't broken any bones, I haven’t been in any fights! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here because my daughter made me come, and now you’re asking me if I’m… decaying?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions are upsetting you, Hedy. I am not implying you are decaying. I ask because fatigue and cravings, along with unusual bleeding or bruising, can sometimes be related to certain medical conditions. I need to rule things out. Let's try a different direction. Do you have any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Chest pain? No! I walk up the stairs, don't I? I garden. I haven’t collapsed, if that's what you're thinking. My heart's fine. It always has been. This is getting me nowhere. I think I want to leave.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that this isn't getting anywhere, Hedy. You’re understandably frustrated. It sounds like you've been experiencing this tiredness for a long time, and it's difficult to pinpoint the cause. Before we stop, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect miracles. I told you, I’m fine. Just tired. Old. Let's just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay. This will just take a moment. Please relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your heart sounds are a bit faint. Your lungs sound clear. Now, could you just take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Fine. deep breath There. Happy? Can I leave now? I have things to do. Programs to write.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Hedy. It's clear you’re very busy. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, I'd like to run some blood tests. These will help us rule out some common causes of fatigue, like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. It would also be helpful to check your iron levels, given the cravings for dirt. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Look, I’m not insured, okay? This is going to be expensive. My daughter can't just pay for everything. I don’t… I don’t know. Is it necessary? Honestly, I just want to go home and take a nap.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Hedy. It's absolutely valid, and I wouldn't suggest anything unless I thought it was important. We can discuss options to minimize costs, perhaps through a local community clinic or a payment plan. The blood tests will help us understand what’s causing your tiredness and the dirt craving. It's possible these are unrelated, but it's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’re looking for things like anemia, which is a common cause of fatigue. And the dirt craving can sometimes indicate an iron deficiency. If we don't investigate, we won’t know for sure, and you’ll continue to feel tired and unwell. Would you be open to me having the lab check the cost of the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Check the cost. But if it's too much… I’m not paying. Just tell me. I don't want to be surprised with a huge bill. Just... hurry up. I really need that nap.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just look this up... Alright, a basic panel to check for anemia, thyroid function, and vitamin levels, plus iron studies, would be $125. There's also a separate test for lead levels, which is sometimes associated with dirt cravings, and that’s another $50. So, total, it would be $175. Does that sound manageable, or is that still too much?
PATIENT: $175… Ugh. That’s… okay. My daughter will probably cover it. But I'm telling you, it’s going to be a waste of money. I'm just tired. Old. But… fine. Do the tests. Just get it over with. And tell me when I can leave.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ve entered the order for the tests. The lab is just down the hall, in room three. The phlebotomist, Maria, will take care of you. It’ll probably take about 15-20 minutes. After the blood draw, you can go home and rest. We'll get the results back in about 3-5 business days. My nurse will call you with the findings, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just… where’s room three? And can I have a glass of water before I go? I feel… faint. This whole thing is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Room three is right down that hallway, the second door on the left. Maria will be waiting for you. And absolutely, here. Please drink this. Take your time, and let me know if you feel any worse. We can reschedule if you need to.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. I think… I think I'm ready to go now. Just… don't expect a lot of enthusiasm when I come back for a follow-up. This whole thing is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Hopefully we can get some answers and help her feel better. .
