DOCTOR: Hi Josie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Just… this heartburn. It’s been awful. Really bothersome, especially at night. I don’t have time for this, honestly. Just want to get it fixed and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Heartburn can be really disruptive, especially when it keeps you up at night. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. To start, can you tell me a little more about this heartburn?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you want to know? It burns, alright? Like fire going up my chest. After I eat, usually. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Though… maybe bigger meals are worse. I don’t know. I just eat normal food. You know, meat and potatoes. Not one of those fancy diets.
DOCTOR: Okay, "fire going up your chest" – that gives me a good starting point. And it sounds like bigger meals might be a trigger. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm... when did it start? Let me think. Probably… oh, a few months ago, maybe? Springtime, I reckon. Around Easter, maybe. It wasn't constant then, just now and again. But lately? Every night. It's… unpleasant. I haven't changed anything in my routine, mind you. Same food, same schedule. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few months ago, starting around Easter, and it’s gotten worse over time, happening nearly every night now. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your diet or daily habits?
PATIENT: No! That’s what I’m telling you. Everything’s the same. I eat a good dinner, watch the news with my wife, and then… burn. It's a simple equation. Honestly, I don't understand why it needs so much investigating. It's heartburn! You give a man something for heartburn and we’re done. I’ve got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I hear your frustration, Josie, and I want to help get this sorted out as quickly as possible. You’re right, sometimes heartburn is straightforward. But to make sure we’re treating the right thing and not missing something else, I need to ask a few more questions. It’s just part of doing a good job, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Ask your questions. But make it quick. And please, no complicated medical jargon. I haven’t got a degree in… whatever it is you doctors study. Just simple questions, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, simple questions. Besides the burning sensation, do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Like… a fever? No, I don’t have a fever. Look, it's heartburn! It burns. What more do you need to know? Sometimes it feels like… something's coming up, you know? A little… regurgitation, I guess you’d call it. Not violent, just… unpleasant. Happens after the burning, usually. That's it. Simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re experiencing some regurgitation after the burning sensation. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or feeling like food gets stuck in your throat or chest?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Food goes down just fine. Never had a problem with that. I eat a hearty meal, and it goes down. That's not the issue. The issue is what happens afterwards. It’s just… uncomfortable. A waste of a good evening, really. I could be watching something good on television.
DOCTOR: Okay, no difficulty swallowing. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t get sick easily. I’ve never been one for vomiting. This is just… indigestion, alright? Bad indigestion. It's not something complicated. Just give me something to neutralize the acid and let me get on with my life. I don't understand why this is taking so long. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting. Now, have you tried anything already to relieve the heartburn?
PATIENT: Tried anything? A little antacid now and then. Those little chalky tablets. Sometimes they help a bit, but not always. And I have to take quite a few to get any relief, and even then, it doesn't last long. Honestly, they barely make a dent. It's just… a temporary fix. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills, you know. That's not healthy. I just want a proper solution. A one-time fix, if possible. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. It sounds like the over-the-counter antacids aren’t providing much relief, and you’re taking quite a few. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… a long time ago. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but it's controlled with medication. Nothing serious. Other than that, I'm a pretty healthy man. I've always been active. Just this heartburn thing… it's frustrating, alright? I don't need a complicated diagnosis. I just want a solution. I'm not made of time, you know. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your gallbladder removed in the past and have high blood pressure that's controlled with medication. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you want to know about pills? Fine. It's… Lisinopril, I think. A little white pill. I take one every morning. My wife handles most of that, honestly. I just take what she gives me. I don’t bother with remembering names. As long as it keeps the numbers down, that’s all that matters. Is that enough information for you, Doctor? Can we please get to the heartburn now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. That's helpful. And yes, we're getting there. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I eat everything. Polish food, mostly. Lots of meat and potatoes. Never had a reaction to anything. Absolutely nothing. My wife always says I have an iron stomach. Though this heartburn is… testing that theory, I suppose. But no allergies. None whatsoever. Can we finally get to the part where you give me something to fix this? I really need to get home. My wife is making pierogi tonight. And I don't want to miss it because of heartburn.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And pierogi sound delicious. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he died young. Horrible habit. Never wanted anything to do with it. My wife doesn’t smoke either. We’re both healthy people. Except for this blasted heartburn. Honestly, I don’t understand why I’m being interrogated like a criminal. All I want is a little relief. Is that too much to ask? Can we please move on? I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, never smoked. And I apologize if I’m making you feel interrogated. I just need to gather all the information to make sure I can help you the best way possible. Finally, how much alcohol do you drink on a typical week?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little bit. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. Nothing excessive. Polish people enjoy a little vodka now and then, but I’m not a big drinker. My wife likes a little sherry. Nothing that would cause heartburn, honestly. I don't sit around drinking all day. Really. This is getting ridiculous. I've answered all your questions. Can we finally get to the medication now? I have a pierogi appointment. It's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a week. Alright, Josie, I appreciate you answering all my questions. It sounds like you've been dealing with this heartburn for a few months, it's getting worse despite trying antacids, and you have a history of gallbladder removal and controlled high blood pressure. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t expect anything. I’m a healthy man. It’s probably just indigestion. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here already. Just hurry up and give me something for the burn, and I’ll be on my way. My pierogi are getting cold. And my wife gets very particular about her pierogi. Very particular indeed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. If you could just lie back on the exam table, please. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs and then feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little tenderness in your upper abdomen, right around where your stomach is. Nothing alarming, but it’s good to note. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have acid reflux, also known as heartburn. The tenderness in your abdomen could be from the irritation of the acid. But to be sure, and given the duration of your symptoms, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests?! Now you want tests?! I came here for a quick fix, not a battery of tests! I told you, it’s just heartburn! My father had heartburn! His father had heartburn! It runs in the family! I don’t need tests! Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t have time for this. Give me something for the acid, and I’ll be on my way. I'm wasting a perfectly good pierogi night here! Honestly, this is outrageous. I’m starting to regret coming here. I should have just suffered through it. Is there no simple solution anymore? Just give me a pill! A simple, effective pill! That's all I ask!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Josie, and I apologize for the delay and the added tests. I truly want to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. The reason I’m recommending tests is to rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms, such as an ulcer or gallstones. While it’s likely acid reflux, it’s important to be thorough, especially since your symptoms have been going on for several months. The tests I’m recommending are a blood test to check for anemia and inflammation, and an endoscopy, which is a procedure where we insert a small camera into your esophagus to look for any abnormalities. I know it’s not ideal, but it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure we’re providing you with the best possible treatment. If you’re not comfortable with the tests, we can try a stronger medication for acid reflux and see if that provides relief. However, if your symptoms don’t improve or worsen, we would need to revisit the possibility of further investigation. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: An endoscopy?! You want to stick a camera down my throat?! Are you serious?! I came in here for heartburn, not a colonoscopy! This is ridiculous! Absolutely ridiculous! I refuse! I absolutely refuse to let you stick a camera anywhere near my insides! Give me a pill! That's all I want! A strong pill! Something to neutralize the acid and let me enjoy my pierogi in peace! I don't need tests! I don't need cameras! I need relief! And frankly, Doctor, I'm starting to think I should have just suffered through it. This whole experience has been more stressful than the heartburn itself! Honestly, I'm leaving. I'm leaving right now. And I expect a full refund for this… ordeal. .
