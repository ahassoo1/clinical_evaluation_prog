DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to Early KAMMER. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Well, it's... a small thing, really. Not a sickness, nothin' like that. Just... feelin' a bit low, you understand? I was hopin' you could write me one of those... get well cards. For encouragement. My ex-wife... she always liked gettin' cards. Makes a man feel better, you know? Even if she doesn't appreciate it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're experiencing some feelings of sadness or discouragement, and you're hoping a card might lift your spirits. While I don't typically prescribe cards, I can certainly see how a small gesture could be helpful. To make sure I understand the situation fully, and to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you’re feeling, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Rule out? What's to rule out? I told you, I ain't sick. Just... down. My daughter, she barely calls. And my ex... well, she's always been a difficult woman. Always lookin' down her nose at me. A card... a nice card from a doctor... that would show her I'm doin' alright. It's a matter of principle, you see? Not a medical problem. You write 'em all the time, don't you? Folks comin' in for a sniffle get a note to go home with.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Kammer. It is important that we address what's concerning you, and I apologize if I jumped to conclusions. I always want to ensure we explore all possibilities to best support your well-being. Sometimes, feelings of sadness or discouragement can be connected to underlying health concerns, even if you don't feel physically ill. That’s why I ask. But I respect your perspective. Let's talk about how long you've been feeling this way. Has it been a recent change, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Always been. My life... it hasn't been easy. Divorce was... messy. Daughter... she takes after her mother, always needin' somethin'. And I work hard, you understand? Boiler operator. Long hours, hot work. It takes a toll. It's not somethin' new, Doctor. This feelin'... it's just... heavier lately. That's why I thought a card... a little somethin' to show them I ain't fallin' apart. It’s… pride, I suppose. Not a medical matter. You understand pride, right? A man's gotta have it.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you've been dealing with a significant amount of stress and hardship for a long time, and that's perfectly valid. And yes, I understand the importance of pride. It's a natural and healthy thing to want to maintain a sense of self-respect and dignity, especially when facing challenges. Given what you've shared, while a card might provide a temporary boost, it sounds like you could benefit from exploring some strategies to manage the ongoing stress and difficult emotions you're experiencing. Would you be open to talking about some options, such as counseling or support groups?
PATIENT: Counseling? Support groups? Doctor, with all due respect, I’m a practical man. I fix things. Boilers, pipes… problems. I don't sit around talkin' about my feelings. That's for… well, not for me. I just want the card. A simple get-well card. It's not askin' much. I don't need help with my "feelings." I need a piece of paper with some nice words on it to show a certain someone I’m doin' just fine. Is that so hard to understand? Honestly, I expected better from a doctor. Thought you'd just write the card and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I haven’t met your expectations. You’re right, a card may seem like a simple request, and I don’t want to dismiss the importance of what it represents to you. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your overall well-being. While I can certainly acknowledge your request for a card, I am ethically obligated to address potential underlying issues contributing to your feelings. Simply providing a card without exploring those issues wouldn’t be responsible medical care. I want to be clear: I’m not suggesting there’s something “wrong” with you. I’m simply recognizing that prolonged stress and difficult emotions can have a real impact on your health. Would you be willing to allow me to perform a brief screening for depression and anxiety?
PATIENT: Depression? Anxiety? Now you're just insultin' me! I am not depressed! I'm a hard-workin' man who's had a bit of bad luck, that's all! You think a card is gonna solve everything? You think writin' a few words is gonna fix my life? No, Doctor. I came here for a card, not a diagnosis. You know what? Forget the card. Forget everything. I'll find a doctor who understands a simple request when they hear one. Honestly... the nerve of some people. .
