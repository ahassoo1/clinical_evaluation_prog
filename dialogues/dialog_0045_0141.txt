DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Billman, nice to meet you too. It’s this itching, really. Just… all over. Been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. It's not, like, a rash or anything, just… itchiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching all over. “A little while now” is… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… close to six weeks, maybe a little longer. It started subtle, you know? I just thought it was dry skin at first, with the summer heat and all. But it hasn't gone away, and it’s getting… more persistent. It’s definitely not the heat now. I’m sorry, just… a little bit now. It comes and goes, but it's there most of the time.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, alright. And you said it’s all over… can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, sorry. It's… everywhere. My arms, legs, back… even my stomach. Not on my palms or soles of my feet, thankfully. It’s just… a general itch. It doesn't really seem to be worse in any one spot. It's just... annoying, all the time. It doesn't feel like bug bites or anything, more like… skin deep. Does that make sense? I’m trying to explain it.
DOCTOR: Okay, generalized itch, not on palms or soles. And no rash. You haven’t noticed any bumps, blisters, or changes in skin color alongside the itching, right?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Definitely no bumps or blisters. And the skin looks… normal, I think. Maybe a little dry in places, but I use lotion regularly. I haven’t noticed any redness or anything unusual color-wise either. I really have been keeping an eye on it, because I was worried about something… worse, you know? It just… is the itch.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any over-the-counter remedies for the itch?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I started with some regular moisturizing lotion, like I said. Then I tried some anti-itch cream with hydrocortisone, the over-the-counter kind. It helped a little, for a very short time, but the itch always comes back pretty quickly. I’ve also been taking an antihistamine at night, just to see if that would calm things down, but it hasn't really made much difference, honestly. I was hoping it would be something simple, but it’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lotion, topical hydrocortisone, and an antihistamine – none of those provided lasting relief. Are you taking any other medications currently, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, just the usual for an old guy, I suppose. I take a low-dose aspirin every day, the doctor said it helps with my heart. And I have a prescription for something for my cholesterol, a statin. That’s it, really. Nothing else. Oh! And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, ibuprofen, but not regularly, just when it’s acting up. Does that all make sense? I try to remember everything, but… it can be a lot.
DOCTOR: Aspirin, statin, occasional ibuprofen. Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years! And the doctors have always asked, and I’ve always said no. I’m usually pretty good with… tolerating things, I suppose. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I don’t think I'm a particularly allergic person, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That's a good question. My mother had… eczema, I think. When she was a child, anyway. And my father had some skin problems when he was older, but I don’t remember exactly what. Something with dryness and itching, I think. On my wife's side… she didn't have any skin issues that I remember, but her mother had… arthritis, badly. That's about all I can recall, honestly. It wasn’t something we talked about a lot. We were more focused on other things, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, tell me a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven't done that in… well, since my wife passed away. I don’t touch the stuff anymore. And absolutely no recreational drugs. Never been interested. I lead a pretty quiet life, these days. Just me and the TV, mostly. And trying to keep the garden going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ferneding. So, you're a 53-year-old male with generalized itching for approximately six weeks, no rash, not relieved by over-the-counter treatments. You have a history of aspirin and statin use, no known allergies, a family history of eczema and arthritis, and a quiet lifestyle. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My shoulder is a little creaky, sometimes, from an old injury, but it’s usually not too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Skin appears normal in color and texture. No visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. Mild dryness noted on the forearms and shins. No lymphadenopathy. Everything looks pretty unremarkable clinically. Given your history and exam findings, my initial thought is this could be a case of dry skin exacerbated by something else, possibly a mild allergic reaction to a new soap or detergent, or even just stress. However, it’s been six weeks and isn’t responding to treatment, so we need to rule out some other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel just to get a baseline and check your liver and kidney function. I'm also going to order a thyroid stimulating hormone test, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause itching. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to do them. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s causing this itch, you know? A blood test and a thyroid test… sounds good. Will you give me a requisition for those? And where should I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Here's the requisition form for the CBC, CMP and TSH. You can get those done at the lab just down the street, at Rural Health Labs. It's the building next to the pharmacy, you can't miss it. They take Medicare, so you shouldn’t have any issues. The results will be sent back to me within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to continue to moisturize your skin several times a day with a fragrance-free lotion. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. And, just to be on the safe side, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose antihistamine to take at night, even though it hasn't helped much so far. It's just to cover all the bases. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good. Moisturize, avoid harsh soaps, and the antihistamine… I can do all of that. Rural Health Labs, right next to the pharmacy… easy enough. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, Doctor, and running these tests. It puts my mind at ease just knowing we're looking into it. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or any warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. In the meantime, just monitor the itch. If you develop a rash, blisters, fever, significant swelling, or notice any yellowing of your skin or eyes, please call the office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Those would be signs of something more serious. Otherwise, try to stay comfortable and avoid anything that seems to aggravate the itch. We'll review the results as soon as they come back and formulate a more definitive plan. Here’s the prescription for the antihistamine. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. I’ll get those tests done right away and I’ll be sure to call if anything changes or gets worse. Have a good day. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Get some rest, and hopefully we can get to the bottom of this quickly. You have a good day too. .
