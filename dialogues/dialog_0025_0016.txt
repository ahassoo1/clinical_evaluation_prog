DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Farson, good morning. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's about my bruising, really. It’s…more than usual. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, since…well, never mind. But I seem to be covered in little purple spots these days. It’s getting annoying, frankly. And my wife…used to worry about it.
DOCTOR: “More than usual,” you say. And you're currently taking a blood thinner… alright. Since when have you noticed this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I'm terrible with dates. Let me think. It's been… a few weeks, I suppose? Since the warmer weather started, maybe? It’s hard to say precisely. It wasn't this bad before. Honestly, everything feels a bit blurry these days. I'm not as sharp as I used to be, you know. It’s just… unsettling to see it spreading like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks, coinciding with the warmer weather. And you mentioned it’s… spreading. Can you describe where you’re seeing these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, it started on my arms, I think. Just little ones, easily dismissed. But now… now they’re on my legs, mostly. And I noticed a couple on my chest this morning when I was getting dressed. Not big bruises, mind you. More like…patches of discoloration. It's quite bothersome. See? Nothing dramatic, but it's more than usual, I assure you. A man doesn't want to look like he’s been in a fight, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. And you said you're on a blood thinner… What medication is that, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…Warfarin, I believe. Yes, Warfarin. The doctor put me on it after… well, it was a blood clot. A nasty thing. And I have to get my blood tested regularly, you know, to make sure the dosage is right. It's a whole… fuss, frankly. I’m quite meticulous about taking it, though. Always the same time. I don’t appreciate messiness.
DOCTOR: Warfarin. And you're diligent about your testing and dosage, you say. Good. That’s…important. Do you know what your most recent INR was?
PATIENT: My…what now? My…Inner… something? Look, I have a nurse send me the results. I don’t pay attention to all those numbers. Honestly, it’s all Greek to me. She tells me if it's okay, and I trust her. She’s a very efficient young woman. Numbers…I just don’t have the head for it anymore. I just know if it’s ‘good’ or ‘needs adjusting.’
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll need to get a better handle on those numbers. Do you recall when your last blood test was performed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was last week, I believe. Tuesday, perhaps? Yes, Tuesday. The nurse called me Wednesday with the results. Said everything was “within range.” Though, as I said, this bruising started after that test. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly. I don’t like things changing. It disrupts the routine.
DOCTOR: Last blood test was Tuesday, within range. And the bruising developed after that. Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well…no, not really. I feel a bit tired, perhaps. But I’m 58, you know. One gets tired. And my appetite hasn't been the best lately, but that could be… well, everything, really. I wouldn't say I'm ill, just…not quite myself. And, now this bothersome bruising. It's all a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: "Not quite yourself," you say. And decreased appetite as well. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Nothing like that. Are you suggesting…? I may be a bit tired, a bit out of sorts, but I'm not falling apart, doctor. That’s a rather…impertinent question, frankly. I assure you, everything is…contained.
DOCTOR: Please, don't misunderstand. I’m simply gathering information. Routine questioning. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years. Antibiotics, pain relievers… the usual. Never had a reaction. I'm a fairly robust specimen, you know. Though, perhaps less so these days. But allergies? No. None. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at this bruising. Just a standard examination, Mr. Farson.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have…appointments, you know. I dislike being poked and prodded, frankly. But alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, doctor. I bruise easily, as you’ve no doubt noticed.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Bruises are primarily ecchymotic, varying in size from small petechiae to larger areas of discoloration. No evidence of significant swelling or tenderness. Palpable peripheral pulses are present bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Farson. Everything appears… stable, but this unexplained bruising warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What does that mean? More blood tests? I just had one! Honestly, this is becoming quite a nuisance. I don’t appreciate unnecessary procedures, doctor. It’s disruptive. And frankly, I don’t like needles. Is this something serious? You're not making me nervous, are you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I’m not trying to cause alarm, but given your age, your medication, and the recent increase in bruising, we need to rule out some potential causes. A complete blood count and a coagulation panel would be the next step. This will give us a more detailed picture of your blood cells and clotting factors. Yes, it will require another blood test, but it’s crucial for determining the underlying cause and ensuring you receive the appropriate care. We also need to review your recent INR results from your nurse. It’s better to be thorough, Mr. Farson, than to ignore something that could potentially be serious. We'll schedule this for first thing tomorrow.
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Absolutely not! I have a luncheon scheduled, you know. With…important people. I can’t just cancel it because of a few bruises! Honestly, the inconvenience… I think I’ll get a second opinion. Yes, a second opinion. That’s what I’ll do. Second opinion… a very good idea. This is ridiculous.
