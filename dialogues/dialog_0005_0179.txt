DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Thank you, Doctor. It is… the words. They do not come so easy now. It is… difficult to find them, you understand? It has been happening for… some time, I think. Not always, but more and more. It is very… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words, or… expressing yourself verbally. Has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. Sudden… no. It was… slow. Like… a fog. At first, only sometimes. Now… more often. I do not remember when it started, exactly. My wife… she would notice first, I think. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say "fog," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… It is not… that I cannot speak. The words are… there, somewhere. But… they do not come to my tongue. Like… a name on the tip of my tongue. You know? I know what I want to say. But… the word… it hides.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you're having trouble with word retrieval. Okay. And does this happen more frequently when you're stressed or tired?
PATIENT: I do not think so. Stress… I am not so stressed now. Tired… perhaps. But it happens when I am rested, also. It is… random, I think. There is no… pattern. I am sorry. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Gyamfi, you're doing fine. It is difficult to explain these things. Have you noticed any changes in your memory, besides this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Memory… hmm. That is a good question. Sometimes… I forget small things. Where I put my glasses, or… what I ate for breakfast. But… I do not think it is so bad. Old age, perhaps? I do not remember things as… clearly as before, but… who does, at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. And my vision is… alright, I believe. I wear glasses, of course, but the prescription has not changed. No dizziness, either. I feel… steady. Just… the words.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Could you follow me over to the table and we’ll start with your reflexes and balance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you think is best. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could lie down on your back for me, please. We’ll start with a neurological exam. Just relax. Okay, reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in the upper extremities… and 2+ bilaterally in the lower extremities. Strength appears 5/5 in all extremities. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? It is… not so easy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little slow, yes, and some mild dysmetria. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am trying. It… makes me a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. No need to strain. We’ll stop there. It sounds like you're experiencing some mild difficulty with coordination, and, as you mentioned, some issues with word retrieval. Given your age and the gradual onset of these symptoms, it could be a number of things. We should rule out any underlying medical causes. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I also want to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. But yes, Doctor. If it helps to find out what is happening… then yes, I am comfortable with that. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of an involved test, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. You'll need to lie very still inside the machine for about 30-45 minutes. You won’t feel anything, but it’s important not to move. The technicians will give you headphones so you can listen to music if you like. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a formal evaluation. They’re the specialists in this area and can help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some cognitive exercises that you can do at home to help sharpen your memory and focus. I’ll have the nurse print out a list for you. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… a lot. But I understand. The neurologist… good. And the exercises… I can try. Thank you. I am… a little worried, I must admit. But I appreciate you taking the time to find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Gyamfi. But we’re going to take things one step at a time. We have a lot of information to gather, but we’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the nurse schedule the MRI and send the referral to the neurologist’s office. She’ll also give you a list of resources for people experiencing cognitive changes. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… you have explained everything very well. Just… the waiting. That is the hardest part, I think. But… thank you again. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. And you’re right, the waiting can be difficult. But we’ll get you scheduled as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule your appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And try not to worry too much. We’re going to do everything we can to help. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi.
