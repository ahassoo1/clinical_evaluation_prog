DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, slowly getting worse over the past few months, and my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It’s making things a bit troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids over a few months… that’s definitely something we want to look into. When you say weakness, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… it’s not like a sudden inability to move, more like… everything requires more effort. Like, climbing the stairs is tiring, and holding things feels heavier than it should. Even talking for a long period… it can be exhausting. It started in my arms, I think, and now it's affecting my legs too. It’s a gradual thing, though, as I said. Not overnight.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of weakness, starting in your arms and now affecting your legs, and feeling fatigued with activities like climbing stairs or even talking… that gives me a better picture. And you mentioned your eyelids feeling heavy and drooping. Is that consistent on both sides, or is it worse on one side?
PATIENT: It’s… I think it’s worse on the left side, yes. It’s subtle, but I’ve noticed it when I look in the mirror. My wife – well, my ex-wife – used to point it out. It’s more noticeable when I’m tired, of course. Everything is. I haven't really paid close attention to if it's exactly the same on both sides, to be honest. I just know the left one feels… heavier.
DOCTOR: Okay, left eyelid drooping more noticeably, especially with fatigue. We’ll definitely take a closer look at that during the exam. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. No, not really. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little blurry sometimes, but I’ve always needed glasses, so I just assumed it was that. I had my eyes checked about a year ago, and they said the prescription hadn’t changed much. I haven't noticed any double vision or anything like that, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, no double vision, and your vision has been stable recently according to your last eye exam. Now, let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms, like muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, thankfully. No muscle aches, swallowing is fine, and… everything is regular down there, if you don't mind me saying. I haven't had any fever, cough, or anything like that either. It's really just the weakness and the eyelids, as frustrating as that is. It's just… tiring, constantly worrying about it getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it's good you haven’t experienced any other major symptoms. Let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox and such, but nothing serious. No major surgeries, no chronic conditions… I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. That's why this is so… concerning. I did have a bout of really bad influenza a couple of years ago, but that's about it. Is that relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've generally been healthy. While the flu itself isn't directly related to what you're describing now, severe illnesses can sometimes have lingering effects. Have you had any surgeries at all?
PATIENT: No, none. Not even tonsils out or anything like that. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I mean, not lucky with this current problem, of course. But in general, I’ve avoided needing serious medical intervention. I’m not a fan of hospitals, if that makes any sense. Just… not my cup of tea.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. Many people feel that way about hospitals. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think, and my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing really… dramatic. No neurological conditions, as far as I know. My family isn't very forthcoming about health issues, to be honest. It's… a bit of a taboo subject. So, I don’t have a lot of detailed information. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common for families to not discuss health issues openly. High blood pressure and heart trouble in your parents is good to know. Finally, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week, but I don't drink heavily. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m quite… a boring fellow, actually. I work, I read, I try to keep fit… that’s about it. Is that… is that relevant? I'm starting to feel a bit like I'm being interrogated. Not that I have anything to hide, of course.
DOCTOR: You’re not being interrogated at all, Gedalya. I just need a complete picture to understand what might be going on. And no, you're not boring at all. That’s all very helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't had any reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I took some antibiotics for a sinus infection a few years ago, and I didn't have any trouble with those. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and nothing’s ever caused a problem. I’m quite… a robust eater, actually. Everything goes down just fine. I suppose I’m pretty lucky in that regard too. It’s just this weakness… that’s the worrying part.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Gedalya, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature – and do a neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination. I’ll also take a closer look at your eyelids. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on with this weakness. It's been rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, your vitals are within a normal range. Now, let’s move on to the neurological exam. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that alright? It feels… a little weaker than it used to, if I'm honest. But I’m trying my best. It’s difficult to gauge, isn't it? How much strength is “normal”? I suppose that’s up to you to decide.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a bit less strength than we’d expect, but not drastically reduced. Now, could you push against my hands with your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. It feels… more effort than it used to. My legs are starting to feel a little tired already, if I’m honest. Is this… is this what you're looking for? Signs of weakness? It’s a little discouraging, to be truthful. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to lightly tap your knee with this little hammer. This is perfectly normal. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but that isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm on its own. Now let's take a closer look at your eyelids. I’m looking for a specific type of drooping, called ptosis. I do notice some ptosis on your left eyelid, and your left pupil appears to be slightly smaller than your right. This, combined with the weakness and fatigue you’re experiencing, is… concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out any other potential issues. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Based on what I've found so far, I'm concerned about a possible neurological issue. It could be a number of things, but we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a blood test to check for certain antibodies and inflammatory markers. I also think an MRI of your brain and orbits would be helpful. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies to contrast dye, as far as I know. An MRI… that sounds… serious. What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something… very bad? I'm starting to feel quite anxious, to be truthful. I had hoped for a simple explanation, but this sounds… complicated. Could it be something like a vitamin deficiency, perhaps? Or a lack of sleep? I’ve been rather stressed at work lately…
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Gedalya, and it’s perfectly natural to feel worried. An MRI allows us to get a detailed look at your brain and the muscles around your eyes, which will help us rule out or identify potential causes for your symptoms. It’s important to remember that an MRI doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It's simply a tool to gather more information. While vitamin deficiencies or lack of sleep can cause fatigue and weakness, the combination of your symptoms – the progressive weakness, the eyelid drooping, the slightly smaller pupil – points towards a possible neurological condition. It could be something like Myasthenia Gravis, which is an autoimmune condition that affects the muscles, or another condition affecting the nerves and muscles. We need the test results to confirm the diagnosis. I'm ordering the blood test and MRI to get a clearer picture. I’ll also refer you to a neurologist for a consultation. They are the experts in this area and can provide a more specialized evaluation and treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… that sounds… frightening. Autoimmune? Is that… curable? I mean, is it something I’ll have to live with for the rest of my life? And a neurologist… how long will that take to get an appointment? I work full time, you see, and I'm not sure how easily I can take time off. This is all… a lot to take in, if I’m honest. I suppose I should ask… what are the next steps, practically speaking? How do I schedule the tests and the appointment? And what should I do in the meantime? Should I avoid any particular activities? I feel rather helpless, just waiting for… results.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune condition, which means there’s no definitive cure, but it is very manageable with treatment. Most people with Myasthenia Gravis can live full and active lives. Treatment usually involves medication to suppress the immune system and improve muscle function. As for the next steps, I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist at the regional hospital. I’ll also give you the paperwork for the blood test and an order for the MRI. The hospital will contact you to schedule those appointments. MRI availability can vary, but typically it’s within one to two weeks. I understand your concerns about work. Explain the situation to your employer and see if you can arrange some flexibility for the appointments. We can also discuss a note for your work if needed. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid activities that significantly worsen your symptoms. If you find that climbing stairs or lifting heavy objects is particularly tiring, try to limit those activities. Get plenty of rest, and try to manage your stress levels. If you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, please go to the emergency room immediately. I will also provide you with a pamphlet on Myasthenia Gravis with further information. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing… that sounds… alarming. I will certainly be mindful of that. And thank you for the pamphlet, that’s very kind. Dr. Sharma… I will look her up. Is she… a good neurologist? I suppose they all are, if they're qualified, but… a good bedside manner is important too. I tend to worry, you see. One last question, if I may. What if… what if it’s something worse than Myasthenia? What are the other possibilities? I know I should probably ask Dr. Sharma, but… my mind is racing, and I'm finding it difficult to think clearly. I just want to be prepared, if possible. I’d rather face the truth, however unpleasant, than live in ignorance. Even a little bit of information would be helpful. Is there anything I should be particularly worried about? .
DOCTOR: I understand your need to be prepared, and it's good that you're asking these questions. While Myasthenia Gravis is the most likely diagnosis based on your symptoms, there are other possibilities, though less common. These include other neuromuscular disorders, like Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, or, rarely, a brain tumor or stroke affecting the muscles. However, it’s crucial to remember that these are less common possibilities, and we don’t have enough information to determine anything definitively yet. Worrying about the worst-case scenario won’t be helpful at this point. It’s far more important to focus on getting the tests done and working with Dr. Sharma to get a proper diagnosis. She is an excellent neurologist, known for her thoroughness and compassionate care. She will explain everything to you in detail and answer all your questions. I want to reiterate that the goal right now is to gather more information. Let’s get the tests done, and we’ll take it from there. Here are the pamphlets and referral information. I'm also writing you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant to help manage any discomfort you’re experiencing in the meantime. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. .
