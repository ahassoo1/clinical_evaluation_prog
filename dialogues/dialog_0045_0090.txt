DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Brightful, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you as well, Doctor Billman. Um... well, it's about a surgery I'm considering. My insurance requires a check-up beforehand, a clearance, they called it. It's… it’s a bit difficult to explain exactly why I'm having it, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But, that’s what I understand I’m here for, yes? A check-up before the surgery.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-operative clearance. Insurance, always something. Well, we'll get you cleared, or figure out what needs to be figured out. You don't need to get bogged down in the details of why right now. But… what kind of surgery are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh… right. Um… it’s… cosmetic. It's to do with… changes after an accident. A fairly long time ago now, actually. Honestly, I don’t recall many specifics. It’s… on my chest. That's all I really know. Is that… enough? I feel terrible not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: "Cosmetic," huh?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I understand that might sound frivolous, but it’s something I’ve wanted for a long time. And it's… important to me, even if I can't explain why perfectly. It's been… difficult, just living with it, I suppose. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, I’m not here to judge what you do with your body. But a surgery… any surgery… carries risk. And pre-op clearances are about making sure you can handle those risks. Let's put the “why” aside. Tell me about your overall health. Any major medical problems?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That makes perfect sense. Um… let me think. I… I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I don't believe so. I generally feel quite healthy. I do have… a bit of trouble with my blood pressure sometimes, it goes up and down. My husband… my late husband… used to keep track of it for me. I haven’t been as diligent since… well, since he passed. Does that… matter? I also have private insurance, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia, blood pressure fluctuations. We'll definitely need to look into that pressure. And yes, insurance is helpful. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, of course. And… oh! I broke my arm as a child, and they had to set it. Was that considered a surgery? Aside from those two things… I don’t think so. It’s so difficult to remember everything. I really apologize for being so… vague. My husband always remembered everything for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Wisdom teeth, broken arm as a child. We’ll go with that for now. What about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… not regularly, no. I take a multivitamin every now and then, and sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, but that's about it. I haven’t taken anything prescribed by a doctor in… a very long time. I try to avoid them, if possible. My husband always said too many pills aren’t good for you. I hope that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think I’m allergic to penicillin, yes. I remember a rash when I was given that as a child. Other than that… no, not that I know of. I don't have any food allergies. I haven’t had any reactions to anything recently. But, again, it’s hard to be certain. I truly apologize if this is frustrating. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful. It's… concerning that you can't recall so much of your medical history. Frankly, it’s not ideal before an elective surgery. It doesn't mean we can't proceed, but it does mean we need to be extra cautious. And it sounds like you might benefit from a more thorough memory assessment down the line. But let’s focus on the pre-op for now. Now, your late husband… did he have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: He… yes. He had diabetes, for many years. And heart problems, towards the end. It was… very difficult. He tried to manage it, but it was a long battle. He… he was a very strong man. I suppose that's why I… well, why I always relied on him to remember things. He took care of everything. And… I'm terribly sorry, I'm getting emotional. It's been… hard to adjust. It feels strange being here alone, talking about medical history. It always felt like his responsibility. Is it okay if I… pause for a moment?
DOCTOR: Take your time, Ms. Brightful. Perfectly alright. We'll take it slow. It's understandable, given the circumstances. We’ll just need to gather what information we can. Now, what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits… um. I don’t… I don't really go out much anymore. After my husband passed, I mostly stayed home. I enjoy gardening, that's my main hobby. I don't drink alcohol. And I certainly don't smoke. I used to go to church occasionally, but… not recently. It's mostly just me and my plants these days. I suppose that's a bit… sad, isn’t it? I don’t want to seem… antisocial. It’s just… difficult to motivate myself. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Right. Gardening, no alcohol or tobacco. Okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just standard stuff, listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, that sort of thing. Can you step up onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I… I hope I don't weigh too much. I haven't really been taking care of myself lately. Please, just let me know if anything seems… concerning.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. Alright. And your height is recorded as 155 centimeters. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Elevated, as expected. Heart sounds… slightly irregular rhythm, will document. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm going to listen again, but that's what I'm getting. No murmurs noted. Overall, your weight is bordering on obesity, and your blood pressure is significantly elevated. We'll need to address that. Now, Ms. Brightful, before we proceed with any surgical clearance, I’m going to order some blood work. Basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and a lipid panel. Also, an EKG to get a better look at that heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG… Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is necessary. I… I just want to make sure I’m healthy enough to… to go through with this. It's… important to me. I'm… a little worried about the results, truthfully. But if it's what I need to do, then I'll do it. When will I… when will I get the results? And what if… what if they show something concerning? I apologize for being such a worrywart.
DOCTOR: The lab work usually takes a few business days. I'll have the results sent to you and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Now, if anything is concerning, we'll talk about options. It might mean postponing the surgery until we get things under control. It might mean further testing. It depends on what we find. But we won’t know until we get the results, alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that makes sense. Postponing… further testing… Alright. I understand. I suppose I just need to… wait. It's… difficult waiting, truthfully. But I’ll do whatever you recommend, Doctor. Thank you for… being honest with me. And for… taking the time to explain everything. I truly appreciate it. Do I need to… schedule the blood work myself? Or will your office handle that?
DOCTOR: My office will handle it. I'm printing out a lab requisition now. It lists the tests and the location of the nearest lab. They'll call to schedule an appointment. I will also have my nurse give you a written summary of everything we discussed today, along with a list of things to avoid before the bloodwork, like fasting. Any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: A written summary… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Fasting… yes, I can do that. No questions at the moment, I think. You've explained everything very thoroughly. I… I suppose that's all, then? Just wait for the lab to call and then schedule the appointment. And then… wait for the results. It feels… a little overwhelming, to be honest. But I appreciate your help, Doctor Billman. Thank you again for everything. I’ll… see you in a few days, then? .
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll be in touch. Don’t hesitate to call the office if anything comes up before then. Good day, Ms. Brightful.
