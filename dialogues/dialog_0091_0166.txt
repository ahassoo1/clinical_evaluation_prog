DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re a new patient with our clinic. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, I am new to the area – and to your practice. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become frequent enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little…off…in my right one, too.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Mr. Kinjerski. Numbness can be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the numbness in more detail?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it’s not a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. It’s more like…pins and needles, a tingling sensation. And sometimes it feels a little cold, even when the room is warm. It usually starts in my foot and then travels up my calf, though, like I said, not always. It comes and goes, and I haven't been able to pinpoint anything specific that causes it, though it seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time. I do quite a bit of work on my feet, you see – animation and special effects can involve a fair amount of physical positioning.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Kinjerski. That’s very helpful. It sounds like we're dealing with a sensory disturbance, and the fact that it’s related to standing and your work is a key piece of information. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. First, have you experienced any recent injuries to your legs or back?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I haven’t had any falls or bumps or anything like that. I'm generally quite careful, and I haven’t engaged in any new physical activities recently that might explain it. I might occasionally strain a muscle while setting up equipment, but nothing serious enough to cause this sort of prolonged numbness. I can recall every setup, if that helps – and I haven’t had any incidents.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have you had any similar episodes in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. This is entirely new. I’ve had the usual aches and pains from long hours, naturally, but nothing like this persistent tingling and numbness. I’ve always been quite healthy, if I may say so. I take care of myself. I can recall being perfectly healthy throughout my childhood, and I’ve only had the standard illnesses – colds, the flu, nothing major.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, are there any other symptoms accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, sometimes my foot feels a little weak, but it’s hard to say if that’s just from standing for so long. It doesn’t give way, or anything. And occasionally, I'll notice a slight burning sensation in my toes, but it’s fleeting. It’s not constant, and it doesn’t really interfere with anything. I can recall noticing it on perhaps three separate occasions in the last month, and it only lasts a few seconds. It’s difficult to describe, really – very subtle.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that thorough detail. It’s helpful to know the specifics, even the subtle ones. Now, let's briefly review your family history. Are there any neurological conditions – such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or peripheral neuropathy – that run in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother’s side of the family… well, my grandmother had diabetes, yes, type 2, I believe. And my uncle, her son, was diagnosed with it a few years back as well. On my father’s side, I don’t recall any specific neurological conditions. He was a fisherman, very strong and healthy, but the family wasn’t one for keeping detailed medical records. I can recall them being generally robust, though. I believe my grandfather had some arthritis in his later years, but nothing beyond that.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kinjerski. That information about diabetes is important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. I’m generally very careful about what I put into my body. Occasionally I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s infrequent – perhaps once or twice a year. And I’ve been taking a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, just to help with the shorter days, but I stopped that in the spring. I can recall exactly when I started and stopped it – March 15th and April 1st, respectively.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can recall trying various foods and medications throughout my life, and I’ve always been perfectly fine. I’ve even experimented with some traditional herbal remedies, though nothing recently.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kinjerski. That completes my questions regarding your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your sensation, reflexes, and strength. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with a neurological exam. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. First, I’m going to test your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Both responses are normal and symmetrical. Now, I'm going to test your sensation. I’ll be lightly touching different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Please tell me when you feel the sensation, and where exactly you feel it. I'm noting decreased sensation on the outer aspect of your left foot and lower calf. Can you describe what you're feeling when I touch those areas?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to describe, Doctor. It’s not a complete absence of feeling, but it’s definitely diminished. It feels… muted, less sharp than the other areas. Almost like there’s a slight…padding…between the swab and my skin. It's not painful, just…less noticeable. I can recall feeling a distinct difference compared to my right leg, it’s quite clear. I'm aware of the sensation, but it’s not as strong or precise.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that precise description. Now, I’m going to assess your strength. Please resist my movements as I apply pressure. Your strength is 5/5 bilaterally, which is normal. However, I'm noting slight weakness when dorsiflexing your left foot – that is, lifting your foot upwards against resistance. Finally, I’ll palpate your pulses to assess circulation. Both pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Based on the physical examination, we have decreased sensation and slight weakness in your left foot, along with a history of numbness related to standing. These findings suggest a possible issue with the nerves in your lower leg. It could be peripheral neuropathy, potentially related to diabetes, or nerve compression. To get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds prudent. Ordering tests seems like the appropriate course of action. I understand the need for further investigation. Please, proceed with whatever you deem necessary to determine the cause of this. I'm aware of the potential connection to diabetes, given my family history, and I trust your judgment. I'm prepared to cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm recommending two tests at this time. First, a blood glucose test to assess your current blood sugar levels and screen for diabetes. Second, a nerve conduction study and electromyography, or EMG, to evaluate the function of the nerves in your lower legs and feet. This will help us determine if there is any nerve damage or compression. The blood test can be done here today. The nerve conduction study will require a referral to a specialist, and we can schedule that for you. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that explanation is quite clear. A blood glucose test and a nerve conduction study – I understand the purpose of both. No, I don’t believe I have any questions at this moment. Just…what is involved in the nerve conduction study itself? I’ve never had one before, and I’m curious as to what I can expect. I recall reading something about it, but I don’t have a precise understanding of the procedure.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin and delivering a mild electrical stimulus. It doesn’t cause any significant discomfort – it may feel like a brief tingling sensation. The electrodes record the speed at which the electrical signal travels along your nerves. The EMG portion involves inserting a very thin needle into your muscles to record their electrical activity. Again, it shouldn't be overly painful – you may feel a slight pinch or muscle twitch. The entire procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The specialist will interpret the results and provide us with a report. Would you like me to provide you with written information about the procedure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, written information would be greatly appreciated. That would put my mind at ease. And thank you for explaining it so thoroughly – it sounds manageable. I understand it's necessary to determine the cause of this numbness, and I trust your assessment. Thirty to sixty minutes – that’s perfectly acceptable. I recall being quite tolerant of minor discomfort, so I’m not overly concerned. Do you have a pamphlet or brochure you can provide?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. This pamphlet provides more detailed information about the procedure, potential risks and benefits, and what to expect during the test. In the meantime, I’m going to order the blood glucose test for you now. Please have a seat in the waiting room, and the phlebotomist will call you in shortly. After the blood test, we can discuss the results and schedule the nerve conduction study. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is everything. Thank you for your thoroughness and patience. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll go and wait in the waiting room and prepare for the blood test. I recall having blood work done previously, so I'm familiar with the process. I trust your judgment and look forward to discussing the results.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please don’t hesitate to let the staff know if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting. We’re here to help. I will review your blood work results as soon as they are available and will be in touch to schedule the nerve conduction study. Have a good day, Mr. Kinjerski.
