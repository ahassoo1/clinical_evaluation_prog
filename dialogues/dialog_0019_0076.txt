DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's these bumps on my legs... my shins, mostly. They're really bothering me, kinda painful, and red. Been getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are painful and red, and getting worse recently. Hmm. Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started small, like little pimples, you know? But they got bigger, and harder. Now they really hurt if I bump them, or even just rub against my pants. They're kinda... raised. Not flat. And yeah, definitely red. I don't remember hurting my legs or anything to cause them.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they started small, like pimples, progressed to be harder and raised, and are now painful to the touch. And no recent injury that you recall?
PATIENT: That’s right. No injury. I’m a laborer, I move freight, so I’m always on my feet, walking and lifting. But I haven't had any falls or anything. It's just… been happening. I thought maybe it was from my work boots rubbing, but it doesn’t really feel like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a laborer, on your feet a lot, which is good to know. And you’ve considered the boots, but it doesn't quite seem right. Do you notice any itching with these bumps?
PATIENT: No, not really itchy. Just… sore. Like a bruise, but bumpy. And they’re kinda… warm to the touch, if that makes sense? Not hot, just… warmer than the rest of my leg. My wife, she noticed it too.
DOCTOR: Okay, sore, bumpy, warmer than the surrounding skin… your wife has noticed them as well, which is helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. No other parts of my body are hurting. Just these bumps, and they make walking a little uncomfortable, that's about it. I haven't felt sick or anything. And no, I don't think they're getting bigger every day, but they haven’t gone away either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or other pain. They haven’t been spreading rapidly, just persistent. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, but nothing major. The doctor gave me some cream for it. And I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. They haven’t said anything about anything else. I’m married, been married a long time. My wife keeps me healthy, makes sure I eat right.
DOCTOR: Okay, some arthritis in your hands, otherwise generally healthy. Regular check-ups with Medicare, that's good to know. And a supportive wife! Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything the doctor's given me before. Maybe a little sleepy sometimes, but that's it. Nothing serious, like swelling or trouble breathing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my hands, like I said. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just hand cream and ibuprofen as needed. Now, I’d like to take a look at those bumps on your shins, if that’s alright with you. Would you mind if I examined your legs?
PATIENT: No, no problem at all, Doctor. Go ahead. They’re right here.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see several raised, reddish bumps on your shins, primarily along the front surface. They appear somewhat firm to the touch, and I do notice some warmth to the area, as you mentioned. There's no sign of open sores or drainage at this time. They seem to be clustered together. Do these feel particularly tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a little sore. Not terrible, but yeah, definitely. It’s kinda a dull ache. And… oh, it feels a little harder right there, see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel that. Slightly indurated, meaning it's a bit firm and hardened. Given the location, the appearance, and your occupation as a laborer, my initial thought is this could be stasis dermatitis or possibly a localized form of vasculitis. It's not something I can diagnose definitively with just a quick exam, though. To be sure, I'd like to order a few blood tests. It'll give us a better understanding of what's going on, and rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… okay. That sounds… alright. I don’t love needles, but if it helps figure out what's wrong, then yeah, I’ll do it. What kind of tests are we talking about? Is it a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: It's not a huge amount, Mr. Aluia, just a standard vial or two. We'll check your complete blood count, your inflammatory markers, and a few things to rule out infection. It's fairly routine. I'll also write you a prescription for a topical steroid cream to help with the inflammation and itching while we wait for the results. We’ll also want to monitor these. If they worsen—increased pain, redness, or any signs of infection like pus or fever—please come back immediately, or go to the emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, so blood tests, cream for the bumps, and watch out for anything getting worse. That sounds good. Cream and blood tests, I can do that. I'll write down the name of the cream, just in case. And where do I go for the blood tests? Do I need an appointment?
DOCTOR: Here you are. This is the lab requisition for the blood tests. You can go to any lab that accepts Medicare, but I recommend [Name of Local Lab]. You do need an appointment; their number is listed on the requisition. And here's the prescription for the topical steroid cream; you can fill that at your usual pharmacy. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs when you can, and avoid any activities that aggravate the pain. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thanks, Doctor. No, I think that covers everything. Elevate my legs, watch for getting worse, and call when the results are back. I appreciate you taking the time to look at these bumps. I was starting to get worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of it. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes before then, or if you have any further questions. Here's my direct line. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
