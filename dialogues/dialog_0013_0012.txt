DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They’ve asked for a doctor’s note, you see. Just to say I’m fit enough to travel, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. A lot of cruise lines do that these days. So, it sounds like you're generally feeling well and just need documentation for the cruise line. Let's go through a quick check-up just to be sure, and I can write that note for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I was widowed five years ago, and that was… difficult, naturally. But I’ve kept myself busy, mostly with my work. I’m a merchandise displayer, you see – window trimming and such. It keeps me on my feet, which is good. I don’t have any major complaints, no. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? My weight is fairly stable, around 109 pounds, and I’m about 5’7” tall. I’ve never had any serious illnesses or been hospitalised, not that I recall. I don’t take any regular medication. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, thank you. It sounds like you’ve been managing well despite a difficult time. Just to be thorough, let's delve a little deeper. You mentioned no serious illnesses. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Nothing like that at all. The doctor always said I had a very strong constitution, and I think he was right. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing that needed more than rest and a bit of soup to cure. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure, and I’ve certainly never been tested for diabetes. My joints ache a little sometimes, especially when it’s damp, but I just put that down to the weather, and getting older. Is that the sort of thing you’re asking about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. That’s very helpful. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. I had all my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was all done at the dentist, not in a hospital. That was… oh, goodness, must have been nearly forty years ago now. I don’t remember it being particularly troublesome. Everything healed up nicely.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother lived to be eighty-two, and she was fairly healthy for most of her life. She did have some trouble with her heart in her later years, I believe. And my father had a bad knee – arthritis, I think it was – but he was a very active man, right up until his last days. My brother is quite well, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other often. He lives in Canada. Nothing major springs to mind, no. I don’t recall any family history of serious illnesses like cancer or anything like that. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very useful information. And just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat most foods, and I’ve never had trouble with insect bites or anything like that. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years when I’ve had a bad cold, but never had any side effects. My mother was allergic to penicillin, I think, but I don't seem to have inherited that. I’ve never had any trouble with hay fever or anything like that either. I’m fairly resilient, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked. Never had the inclination. My husband didn’t smoke either, so it wasn’t something that was ever around the house. I always thought it was a rather unpleasant habit, to be honest. It makes one smell dreadful, and it's terribly expensive! I do enjoy a wee dram of whisky occasionally, but only as a treat, and not very often. Perhaps a glass at Christmas, or on a special occasion. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And how about alcohol – aside from the occasional whisky, how often do you drink?
PATIENT: Oh, very rarely, Doctor. As I said, just a wee dram now and then. Perhaps a glass of wine with a nice meal, maybe once or twice a year. I don't drink regularly, and I certainly don't drink to excess. I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest. Or a bit of lemonade on a warm day. I’m not much of a drinker, really. I find it doesn’t agree with me. It makes me feel a bit fuzzy-headed, and I prefer to be clear-headed, especially with my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, are there any changes in your life recently that have caused you stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… the cruise is a bit of a big thing for me. It’s the first proper holiday I’ve taken since my husband passed away. It's exciting, of course, but also a little daunting going off on my own. I’m a bit worried about getting seasick, to be honest. And I’m a bit anxious about all the arrangements – making sure I have everything I need, and that everything goes smoothly. But nothing too serious, you understand. Just the usual worries about travelling alone, I suppose. It’s a good sort of stress, if that makes sense. The stress of anticipation, rather than the stress of trouble.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It’s completely normal to feel a little anxious before a big trip, especially after a significant life change. It sounds like you’re looking forward to it, despite a few understandable worries. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to be sure everything’s in good working order. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I’m quite a sturdy person, as I said, but I always think it’s best to be on the safe side. Do I need to do anything to prepare, or can we just get on with it?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to do anything special. Just relax, and I’ll walk you through everything. If you could just sit here for me, please. We'll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll just take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I’m quite used to these sorts of things, though it’s been a while since I last had a proper check-up. I always try to stay healthy, you see, so I don't usually need to bother the doctors too much. But as I said, it’s best to be on the safe side, especially with the cruise coming up. Do I need to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: You don't need to take your shoes off just yet. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, which is perfectly normal. Pulse is 72, regular and strong. Temperature is 98.6, also normal. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks healthy, no redness or swelling. Everything seems to be in good working order so far. Do you have any pain when I press gently on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. That doesn't hurt a bit. I do sometimes get a little bit of indigestion, but that's usually after I've eaten something rich, or if I've had too much tea. But I can’t say I’ve got any pain at the moment. Everything feels quite alright down there, thank you. It’s good to hear you say everything is in good working order, though. It puts my mind at ease, you see. The cruise is a bit of a long way away, and I want to be sure I’m fit enough to enjoy it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And your reflexes are normal, and you have good strength in your arms and legs. Overall, you seem to be in very good health for your age. So, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m happy to say you’re fit to travel. I’ll write a note for the cruise line confirming that. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much. That’s a great weight off my mind. No, I don’t think there’s anything else, thank you. Just the note for the cruise line, if you wouldn't mind. And perhaps if you could tell me how long it will take to get it? I need to send off the paperwork fairly soon, you see. I’m very grateful for your help, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m writing the note now. It will state that you are in good general health and fit for travel, with no contraindications to cruising. It’ll also include the date of the examination. It will take just a moment to print. Here you are. This should be sufficient for the cruise line. It’s dated today, August 2nd, 2025. If they require anything further, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can do for you before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, thank you so much, Doctor. It’s exactly what I needed. You’ve been very kind and helpful. No, I think that’s all, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll make sure to send off the paperwork right away. Thank you again for everything. And have a lovely day, Doctor!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda! I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise – it sounds like you deserve a wonderful break. Have a lovely day too, and safe travels. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Goodbye!
