DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Croonquist, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just... lab work, I think. Medicare said I need some done. Honestly, I don't really remember what work. It's all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just… get it over with? No offense.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Croonquist. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed with these things. Let me see… it looks like you're due for your annual wellness check, which includes some routine blood work and a physical. That's what Medicare is referring to. Before we jump into the blood draw, would you mind if I just ask a few questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Ugh. Look, I'm a simple man, Doctor. Just... the quicker we do this, the better. But alright, fine. Just… keep it short, okay? My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I’ll just end up repeating myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I’ll be as concise as possible. And don’t worry about repeating yourself – I’m happy to clarify anything. First, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. I suppose so. No major complaints. Everything aches a bit, you know, being old. But that’s just… life. Is that what you want to know? I haven't been sick, sick. Just… old.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, no major illness is always a good sign. And yes, that’s exactly what I'm trying to find out. When you say "aches a bit," where specifically are you feeling those aches?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. My knees, mostly. And my back. Sometimes my shoulders. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. It just… comes and goes. Like a dull headache, but all over. I used to work with heavy machinery, you know. Power plant stuff. Probably from that. Though it was a long time ago… I can’t quite remember when.
DOCTOR: I see. So, primarily knees, back, and shoulders, and it's more of a constant, dull ache rather than a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it exactly. Dull. Constant. Not anything that sends me running to the hospital, thankfully. Just… annoying. Look, is this getting us any closer to the lab work? I'm not trying to be rude, Doctor, but I have... things to do. Not important things, mind you, but things nonetheless.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Croonquist. I’m just trying to get a full picture. And I promise we're getting there. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints - your knees, back, or shoulders?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it, my knees do feel a bit thicker sometimes. Not huge, mind you. Just… puffier than usual, I guess. Especially after I’ve been… walking. Or standing. Is that swelling? I don’t know medical terms, Doctor. Just tell me if it’s bad.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know that you've noticed some puffiness after walking or standing, Mr. Croonquist. That's good information. Do you have any trouble getting up from a chair, or going up stairs?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Getting up is… a process. Lots of grunting involved. And stairs? Forget about it. I take them very slowly. Or I avoid them altogether, if possible. My apartment building has an elevator, thank goodness. It’s… humbling, getting old, Doctor. Humbling. Can we please just get to the blood work now?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. And yes, aging can be challenging. Okay, before we do the blood work, let’s quickly review your medications and allergies, if any. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, I believe. A little white pill. Can’t remember the name. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for the aches. When they’re really bad. That's it, I think. No allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning, let alone what I’m allergic to. This is ridiculous, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not ridiculous at all, Mr. Croonquist. Memory can be tricky. Okay, so blood pressure medication – do you know who prescribed it, or roughly how long you’ve been taking it?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now you’re asking too much. Doctor, it was… a doctor. Years ago. I moved here after I retired, you see. I don’t even remember my old doctor’s name. I just went to the pharmacy and they filled it every month. I suppose. It was a blue pharmacy, maybe? I don’t know. This is hopeless, isn’t it? Just… skip it. I’ll tell you whatever the lab finds, that’s good enough. Let's just do the blood work, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. We can definitely proceed with the blood work. I understand your frustration. Before we do that, just a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quickly. My patience is wearing thin. And be gentle with my knees, alright? They’re sensitive. This whole thing is just… exhausting. Let’s get it over with. Hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds regular, but a little quieter than I’d like. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you bend them for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not pleasant. They crack a lot. And they feel… loose. Like they might give out. Don’t push too hard, alright? They're old knees, Doctor. Very old. And creaky. Is that what you want to hear? I’m telling you, it’s just old age. Can we please get to the needles now? I hate needles. Truly hate them. The anticipation is worse than the pain, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. There's some swelling and I can feel some creaking when you move them. It’s good you’re letting me know what you’re experiencing. Alright, Mr. Croonquist, let's get this blood work done. We’ll get you comfortable and quick about it. We’ll just need a few vials. I'll explain everything to the phlebotomist, and she’ll take good care of you. Try to relax, and take a few deep breaths. Do you prefer I look away while she draws the blood?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Absolutely look away. I don't want to see it. Honestly, just get it over with as fast as possible. The quicker it’s done, the better. And tell her to be gentle, alright? Gentle. I bruise easily these days. My blood is… thin, I think. Is that a bad thing? Oh, never mind. Just… hurry. I'm ready when you are. Let’s just get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Alright, we’re all set. I'll be right here if you need anything. .
