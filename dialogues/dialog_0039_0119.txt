DOCTOR: Hello, Jinnie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you, Doctor. It’s… a bit awkward, truthfully. I don't usually bother doctors with these sorts of things, but… well, there’s a discharge. A… problem, down there. A gentleman friend, you see. And it’s not… pleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright to come in for these things, Jinnie. That's what I'm here for, and many women experience similar issues. It takes courage to talk about these things, so thank you for being open with me. When you say “discharge,” could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Courage? It’s hardly… a feat of bravery, Doctor. It's simply… unsightly. And embarrassing, frankly. But, alright. It’s… yellowish, mostly. Not a lot, thankfully. More of a… dampness, really. And it smells… not quite right. It’s been going on for about a week, I’d say. Longer, perhaps? It’s difficult to keep track, you understand. A woman has other things on her mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. It’s easy to lose track when things are… uncomfortable. A week or so is helpful to know. And you're right, life gets in the way. Okay, yellowish discharge, not a large amount, more of a dampness, and an unusual odor for about a week. Is it accompanied by any itching, burning, or pain?
PATIENT: Well, no. Not pain, exactly. A little… discomfort, perhaps, when I… well, when things are active, you understand. But nothing I’d call painful. And no itching, no. Just… the dampness. And the smell. It’s quite… noticeable, I’m afraid. I’ve been trying to be extra… tidy, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort with activity, no pain or itching, just the discharge and odor. That helps. Do you notice any changes in your urination – any burning, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Burning? No. Not at all. Urination is… normal, as far as I can tell. Perhaps a little more frequent, now that I think of it. But I’ve been drinking more water, you see. It’s been quite hot, and one must stay hydrated. I wouldn’t say it’s urgent, exactly. Just… a bit more often than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly more frequent urination, but no burning or urgency. And you’ve been staying well hydrated, which is good. Now, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been… quite careful, you understand. Proper hygiene and all that. And I don't… well, I don't have multiple partners, if that’s what you're implying. It’s simply… baffling. And rather upsetting, to be honest. It’s not something one expects at my age.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jinnie. It’s good you’ve been careful, and it’s completely valid to be upset. It’s not something anyone expects, regardless of age. And I wasn’t implying anything at all – just gathering information. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – like diabetes or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's all. Nothing serious. And I take a little something for my blood pressure, but it’s under control. The doctor says it’s just age. I’m on Medicare, if that’s relevant. I don’t usually go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, you see. They tend to… overreact, in my experience. And prescribe all sorts of things you don't need.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands, managed blood pressure, and on Medicare. That's helpful. It's good it's managed. And I understand your concerns about over-prescription. We’ll take things slowly and only do what’s necessary. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to take something for hay fever when I was younger, but I moved to the city and it’s not a problem anymore. Honestly, I’m quite a healthy woman, all things considered. This… discharge is a complete mystery.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. And you sound very healthy overall, which is excellent. Alright, Jinnie, I think it’s time for a quick physical exam. Just a standard exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, isn’t it? I’d rather not, of course. It’s… undignified. But if you insist. Just… please be quick, Doctor. And gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. We'll take things very slowly and be as gentle as possible. Your comfort is my priority. I'll explain everything as we go. I'm just going to have you lie down on the exam table. I'll need to take a look at the area and possibly take a small sample for testing. This will help us identify the cause of the discharge and get you the right treatment. Okay, I see some mild inflammation and the discharge is yellowish, as you described. It doesn’t appear to be anything immediately alarming, but we need to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a simple urine test and a swab to check for any infection.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't… pleasant. I hope you didn’t see anything too dreadful. So, a urine test and a… swab. What sort of infection are you looking for, exactly? Is it… something serious? I do hope it’s not sexually transmitted. I’ve been very careful, you understand.
DOCTOR: It wasn’t unpleasant for me, Jinnie, and you were very cooperative, thank you. I understand your concern. We're checking for common infections that can cause discharge, like bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. These are very common and easily treated. We’ll also rule out any sexually transmitted infections as a precaution, but based on what you've told me, it's less likely. The tests will give us a clear answer. I'll send the orders to the lab now. They usually have results back within a couple of days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching and wearing cotton underwear to keep the area dry. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Cotton underwear… yes, that makes sense. I suppose. Avoiding douching… I haven’t done that in years, thankfully. It always seemed… unsanitary. So, a couple of days. And then you’ll call with the results? I do hope it’s nothing too serious. It’s… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Yes, a couple of days, and we'll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. I understand your anxiety, Jinnie. It’s always unsettling not knowing. But we’ll get to the bottom of this. While we're waiting for the results, if you experience any fever, severe pain, or unusual odor, please call us immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest and stay comfortable. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I suppose I've said everything I need to say. I just… thank you, Doctor. For being… patient. And for not judging. It’s not easy, talking about these things. And I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jinnie. It was my pleasure. You showed a lot of courage coming in today, and I'm glad you felt comfortable enough to talk to me. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and try not to worry.
