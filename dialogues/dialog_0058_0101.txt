DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not constant, comes and goes. Feels like a tight band, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. A headache at the back of your head, coming and going, feels like a tight band… Okay. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about three weeks ago? Hard to say exactly, things kinda blur these days, but I’d say around then. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little niggle. But it's been gettin’ worse the last week or so. Mostly in the evenings, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, starting mild and worsening over the last week, primarily in the evenings. Is there anything that seems to trigger these headaches, Aldine?
PATIENT: Trigger? Now that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I do a lot of work with my hands, you know, bein' a manicurist. Maybe that? But I've been doin' that for years. And I try to take breaks. Sometimes it’s there after a long day, sometimes it’s not. Don’t seem to be a pattern, really. Worryin’ does it sometimes, I reckon. But who doesn't worry these days?
DOCTOR: Right. A lot of hand work, but no clear connection. Worry… well, we can explore that later. Just to be thorough, Aldine, are you experiencing any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No nausea, no blurry vision. Not dizzy. Sometimes my neck feels a bit stiff, especially if I've been bendin’ over a lot. And… now that you mention it, my shoulders do ache a bit. But I just put that down to old age! It’s hard to tell what’s what when you get to be my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea, no vision changes, no dizziness. Neck stiffness and shoulder aches. That’s helpful. And have you noticed any changes in your sleep, Aldine?
PATIENT: Sleep? Not really. I sleep alright, I think. Maybe I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to, wake up a couple times during the night. But nothing major. My wife says I snore a bit, but she’s always sayin’ that! Been married a long time, you know, she notices everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, Aldine, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Not really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but it’s been under control with the pills. And arthritis in my hands, of course, that's why I have to take breaks when I’m workin'. Otherwise… no, nothin’ major. Been pretty lucky, all things considered. I eat reasonably well, try to stay active. You know, the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and arthritis in the hands. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think... Ah, here we are. The blood pressure pills, yes. And… ibuprofen, sometimes, for the arthritis when it flares up. But not every day, just when I need it. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor suggested it a while back. Said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. It’s all there, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. Never had any trouble with food. And the doctor’s always checked when they give me new pills, and I’ve never had a reaction. I’m pretty lucky that way too, I suppose. Always been a strong constitution, my mother used to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, Aldine, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything's uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear bilaterally. There's some mild tenderness in the posterior neck muscles, and slight stiffness. Range of motion is slightly limited, with discomfort on extension and lateral flexion. Alright. I'm also going to check your neurological function quickly. Follow my finger with your eyes… Strength is 5/5 in all extremities, reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Okay, Aldine, everything seems relatively normal. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by your arthritis and neck stiffness. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing as well.
PATIENT: Tension headaches, you say? That sounds… reasonable. I do get stressed sometimes, runnin’ my own business and all. And the arthritis, yes, I reckon that plays a part too. So, what do we do about it, Doctor? Anything I can take? Or is it just one of those things?
DOCTOR: Well, Aldine, it's rarely "just one of those things." There are things we can do. For the headaches, I recommend starting with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as you’ve already been doing, but be mindful of the dosage and frequency. We don’t want to upset your stomach or interfere with your blood pressure. More importantly, we need to address the underlying causes. I recommend some simple lifestyle modifications: stress management techniques like deep breathing exercises or gentle yoga, regular stretching of your neck and shoulder muscles, and ensuring you’re getting adequate sleep. And of course, keeping your blood pressure under control is vital. Are you regularly monitoring your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I do manage my blood pressure, thank you very much. I go to my regular doctor every three months, and I take my pills like I’m supposed to. I ain’t foolish. And I do try to keep my stress in check, runnin’ a business is stressful enough without someone telling me to breathe deep! I was hopin’ for somethin’ a little more… specific, to be honest. Some sort of cream for my neck, maybe? Or somethin’ to take when the headaches get really bad? I’m not lookin’ for a lecture on livin’ a healthy life, I’m lookin’ for relief.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. I understand your frustration. While lifestyle modifications are the cornerstone of treatment, we can consider some additional options. For your neck pain, I can prescribe a topical muscle relaxant. It won’t solve the problem entirely, but it may provide some temporary relief. As for stronger pain medication, I’m hesitant to prescribe anything beyond over-the-counter options at this time, given your blood pressure and age. We need to be cautious about potential side effects. I’m also going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your headaches and to monitor your kidney function, given your ibuprofen use.
PATIENT: Blood work, alright. That’s… reasonable. And a cream for my neck, I appreciate that. Look, Doctor, I ain’t askin’ for miracles. Just somethin’ to take the edge off. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve learned to manage things myself. But sometimes, you need a little help. So, thank you. I suppose. When will I get the results of the blood work? And where do I pick up the prescription for the cream?
DOCTOR: The blood work results should be available in about a week. The nurse will call you with the results and instructions. As for the prescription, you can pick it up at the pharmacy down the street. I’ll send it electronically, so it should be ready within the hour. Do you have any other questions for me, Aldine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you listenin’ to me, even if you didn’t think much of what I had to say. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Aldine.
