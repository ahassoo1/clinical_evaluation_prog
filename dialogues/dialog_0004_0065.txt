DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s the weight. I’ve gained a fair bit, and I can’t seem to figure out why. It's rather unsettling, to be honest. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I’m certainly not getting less active.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Unexplained weight gain, you say. And you're certain there haven’t been any changes to your diet or activity level?
PATIENT: Positive. I prepare my husband and my meals myself, mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, you understand? Potatoes, beets, some meats… nothing extravagant. And we walk daily, about an hour each time, weather permitting, of course. It’s been consistent for years. I assure you, Doctor, nothing has altered.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been noticing this weight gain, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it began, I’d say, approximately three months ago. Perhaps a little longer. It was gradual at first, barely noticeable, but it’s become quite pronounced in the last six weeks, I believe. I noticed my clothes fitting more snugly, and the scale… well, the scale confirms it. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And roughly how much weight would you estimate you've gained over these three months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let’s see… I weighed myself religiously last month, and it was… 178 pounds. Now, as of this morning, it's 186. So, approximately eight pounds. It doesn’t sound like much when I say it aloud, but I can feel it, you understand? And I’m not a large woman to begin with. I’m only five foot tall.
DOCTOR: Five feet and 186 pounds… Yes, that is a noticeable change. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka, let's delve a little deeper. Besides the weight gain, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me ponder. No, not really. I’ve been sleeping alright, perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but I attribute that to the summer heat, truthfully. No fever, no aches, no… unusual bowel habits, if you understand what I mean. My appetite is normal, perhaps even a little lessened, now that I think of it. It’s just… the weight. It’s very perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t required any prescriptions in years. Just the occasional over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, perhaps, but nothing regularly. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if possible. My grandmother always said a good cup of chamomile tea fixes most ailments. Though, it seems chamomile tea isn’t helping with this particular issue.
DOCTOR: I see. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. No rashes, no swelling, nothing of the sort. I can eat almost anything without issue, thankfully. My husband isn’t so lucky, he has a sensitivity to shellfish, but I do not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had some issues with her blood sugar later in life, so perhaps a predisposition to diabetes? It wasn't officially diagnosed until her seventies, though. And my father, he had a weak heart, but that was more from years of… hard work, and not necessarily hereditary. My maternal grandmother had… well, she was a bit frail in her old age, but I don’t believe there were any specific diagnoses. It was a simpler time, you understand. Not much talk of such things.
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, my husband and I live a rather quiet life. We keep to ourselves mostly, but we are active, taking our daily walks. I manage the household, and prepare all our meals. We don’t smoke, and we rarely drink alcohol – only a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I don’t have any particularly stressful commitments, though I do worry about my son, he lives quite far away. But that’s… normal for a mother, I suppose. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Selbitschka, given your description and family history, it's difficult to pinpoint the cause of the weight gain without a proper examination and some testing. We’ll need to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to start by checking your thyroid, blood pressure, and listening to your heart and lungs. And I'm going to take your height and weight again just to confirm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate your thoroughness. Please, proceed as you see fit. I just want to find out what’s causing this. It’s… unsettling to feel something changing without knowing why. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll step onto the scale, please. And then we can proceed with the rest of the examination. Okay, 5’0” and 186 pounds. Now, if you’ll just have a seat on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths through your mouth.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… I’m doing my best, Doctor. It’s… a bit cool in here, you know. But I’m trying to breathe as deeply as possible.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No nodules or tenderness detected. Blood pressure is 138/82. A bit elevated, but not drastically so. Okay. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright. No tenderness, Doctor. Nothing at all. It feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I do have a bit of… fullness, perhaps, but that’s likely just the meal I had earlier. Nothing concerning, I assure you. You may proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Based on the physical exam, everything seems within normal limits, but the weight gain and slightly elevated blood pressure warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a lipid panel. These tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to comply with whatever tests you deem necessary. The sooner we find out what’s causing this, the better. I must admit, I’m a bit anxious, but I trust your judgment. Please, proceed with the blood tests. How will I receive the results? And will I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write the requisition forms now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to draw the blood right away. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. Once I have them, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can go over the results together and formulate a plan. Here you are. And just to be on the safe side, given the slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend monitoring it at home for a week. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keep a log of your readings and bring it with you to our follow-up appointment. And just as a precaution, I’m going to recommend a slight dietary adjustment – reducing your sodium intake. It’s a good general health measure, and it may help lower your blood pressure. I can provide you with some resources on low-sodium cooking. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Very well. Monitoring the blood pressure at home sounds like a good idea. And reducing sodium… yes, I suppose that’s sensible. My grandmother always said too much salt wasn’t good for the heart. I don’t believe I have any questions at the moment, Doctor. Just… when should I expect a call regarding the results? A few days… is that two or three? And will someone explain the results to me over the phone, or is a follow-up appointment absolutely necessary? I just… I’m not very good with medical jargon, you understand.
DOCTOR: “A few days” generally means three to five business days, Ms. Selbitschka. The lab work needs to be processed and I need time to review the results thoroughly. The office staff will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We will discuss the results in person, as it’s much easier to explain them with visuals and answer any questions you may have. I understand medical terminology can be… confusing, and I’ll make sure to explain everything in a way you can understand. We won’t just read off numbers; we’ll talk about what they mean for your health. However, a preliminary phone call to let you know when the appointment is scheduled is certainly possible. I’ll make a note to have the office schedule the follow-up appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. A follow-up appointment is perfectly acceptable. And the preliminary phone call to schedule it… yes, that would be very helpful. I just… I prefer to be prepared, you understand. No, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for your thorough examination and your clear explanations. I hope the blood tests reveal something… manageable. I suppose I’ll be on my way, then. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane.
DOCTOR: Very well. The office will be in touch shortly. Remember to monitor your blood pressure and reduce your sodium intake. And don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Have a good day, Ms. Selbitschka.
