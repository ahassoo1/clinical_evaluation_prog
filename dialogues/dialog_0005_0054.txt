DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Sorry, I... I keep coughing. A lot. And I feel very tired all the time. Like, really tired. And my nose… it gets blocked up a lot. I think I get sick… like a cold… a lot too. I don’t really know what to tell you. It’s just… been going on for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. "A while now" is… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Um… a few months, I think? Maybe longer. It's hard to say. I don't really keep track, you know? It just... started and hasn't really gone away. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. My wife tells me I cough in my sleep too. I don’t remember that though.
DOCTOR: Right. Months. And you said tiredness and a blocked nose as well?
PATIENT: Yeah, the tiredness is bad. Like, I can’t even… I get home from work and just sleep. And I still feel tired. And the nose… it’s always stuffy. I have to blow my nose a lot. Sometimes my head hurts too, when it's blocked up. It's just… annoying, you know? I do tire work all day, and I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: "Tire work"?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. I fix tires. And change them. At the shop. You know, cars… wheels… I work with tires all day. It's hard work, lifting and everything. That’s why I’m tired all the time maybe? But I was tired before the lifting got so bad too… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, tire work. And this cough, nose blockage, and tiredness… is it worse at any particular time of day, or after doing certain things?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it gets worse at night. The cough, mostly. It wakes me up sometimes. And when it’s dusty at the shop, it's really bad. The dust… it makes me cough a lot more. I try to wear a mask, but… it’s hot, you know? Hard to breathe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had a fever, chills, any body aches, or lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: Fever… I don't think so. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing bad. No chills, no body aches… I don’t think. Weight… I don’t know. My wife says I eat less now, but I haven't weighed myself. It's hard to say. Everything feels… blurry. I just feel tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't know. I think I sometimes sneeze when there are flowers, but… everyone sneezes around flowers, right? I haven't ever been to a doctor about it. I just… try to avoid them. Does that count? I don't know what I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I take something for headaches, like paracetamol, when my head hurts bad. But that’s it. Nothing for the cough, or the nose. I just… try to rest. My wife gives me some… some cough syrup sometimes, but it doesn't really help. I don't know what's in it. She buys it from the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I don’t like feeling tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll listen to your lungs and take a look at your throat. Please take a deep breath when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… okay. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath... and another one. Your throat looks a little irritated, not severely, but definitely some inflammation. And your lungs sound… a little congested, some wheezing in the lower lobes. Do you ever experience any chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… not really. Sometimes it feels tight, but I just thought it was from lifting the tires all day. Shortness of breath… maybe a little when I walk up the stairs, but I'm not very fit, you know? I just figured it was because I was tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your temperature and blood pressure. Temperature is slightly elevated at 37.8 Celsius, and your blood pressure is a little high at 140/90. Hmm. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s possible you have a respiratory infection, likely bronchitis, although the persistent nature of it and your slightly elevated blood pressure are concerning. I’m going to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything more serious and some blood tests to check for inflammation and rule out other possibilities. Do you have any known heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, I don’t think so. Never been told I had any. My wife always tells me to slow down, but… I just thought she was worrying. I get out of breath easily, but I just thought it was from the work. X-ray? Blood tests? That sounds… serious.
DOCTOR: It’s best to be thorough, Mr. Tati. We need to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. The X-ray will help us see if there’s any inflammation or fluid in your lungs. The blood tests will give us a better picture of your overall health. I’m going to write you a referral for those tests. I also want you to start using an inhaler to help with your breathing. It’s a bronchodilator—it opens up your airways. And for now, try to get as much rest as possible and drink plenty of fluids. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Inhaler… okay. Bronco… what did you call it? It helps me breathe? And rest… I try. But I need to work. How long will the tests take? And will they hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: The bronchodilator—the inhaler—will help you breathe easier by opening up your airways. It doesn't hurt. You just puff it into your mouth. As for the tests, the blood tests are relatively quick—a few minutes. The X-ray is also painless—it's like a quick scan. It won't hurt. As for how long it will take to get the results… usually a couple of days. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. Mr. Tati, I also recommend you see a cardiologist, just to rule out any underlying heart issues. Your blood pressure is a little high, and we need to investigate that further. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Cardio… a heart doctor? Is something wrong with my heart? I thought I just needed rest! And… I don’t have insurance, Doctor. I can’t afford all these tests… and doctors. I just… I need to work to pay the bills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Tati. It’s not necessarily that something is wrong with your heart, but your slightly elevated blood pressure and the persistent shortness of breath warrant further investigation. It’s best to rule everything out. And I understand the financial burden. Let me see what resources are available in the area for uninsured patients. We can explore some options for financial assistance with the tests and potential cardiology consult. There are programs out there. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for the inhaler, and we can focus on getting you some relief from your breathing symptoms. And please, try to take it easy as much as possible. Do you have any family history of heart problems or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… um… my father… he had high blood pressure. He was always tired too. And he… he had chest pains sometimes. He didn't go to the doctor much though. He just… rested. And my mother… she had coughs a lot when she got older. But that's all I remember. This doesn't sound good, does it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tati, it doesn’t. But knowing your family history is helpful. It reinforces the need to get this checked out. We're not jumping to conclusions, but we need to be thorough, given your symptoms and your father’s history. Alright, I’m going to write you the referral for the X-ray and a cardiology consult. I'll also give you a list of resources for uninsured patients and some information about managing your symptoms in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I just hope it's not too bad. And I hope I can afford it. I'll try to make the appointment as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Tati. We’ll do everything we can to help you figure this out. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and please follow up as soon as possible. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. Bye. .
