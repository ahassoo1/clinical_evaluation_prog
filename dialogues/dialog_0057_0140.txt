DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this, if you don’t mind a quick consultation. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. I have something… unpleasant in my mouth. It’s white, and it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I understand you're short on time, and I'll do my best to be efficient. And don't worry about embarrassment – we're here to help, and I assure you, I've seen it all. Okay, so you have a white patch or area in your mouth that isn't resolving. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. It’s…on my tongue, mostly. And it's…well, it looks like milk curds, if you understand. Very annoying, and it makes it difficult to taste things properly. I tried rinsing with mouthwash, but that hasn’t done a thing. I haven’t been feeling ill otherwise, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white coating on your tongue, resembling milk curds… and it's impacting your sense of taste. You've tried mouthwash without improvement, and you haven't experienced any other symptoms like fever or feeling generally unwell. When did you first notice this patch, Antoine?
PATIENT: About…oh, a week, perhaps a little longer. It started small, I didn't pay it much attention at first. Thought it was just something I ate. But it’s spread, and now it's quite noticeable. Honestly, my wife pointed it out. She has a… keen eye for these things.
DOCTOR: A week or so, starting small and progressing… and your wife brought it to your attention. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort associated with it?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It’s…more of a nuisance than anything. A slight burning sensation sometimes, if I eat something very acidic, but no real pain. It’s just… unsightly, and it’s affecting my enjoyment of food. I’m a man who appreciates a good meal, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. A nuisance that’s affecting your quality of life. No pain, just occasional burning with acidic foods. Have you noticed any other changes in your mouth, like redness, sores, or bleeding?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the white coating. And it’s… mostly on my tongue, though it seems to be spreading to the insides of my cheeks a little now. It’s not a large area, but it’s… growing. I assure you, I maintain excellent oral hygiene. I brush twice daily, floss… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's primarily on the tongue, but now also appearing on the insides of your cheeks. Despite good oral hygiene – brushing and flossing twice daily – it's still progressing. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you been experiencing any other symptoms recently – anything at all, even if it doesn’t seem related?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, nothing significant. Perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but that could simply be the heat. It’s been exceptionally warm lately. And…no, I can’t recall anything else. I don’t take any medication, if that’s relevant. I prefer to avoid pills whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medication, some fatigue potentially related to the heat. No other symptoms to report. And to confirm, you haven't noticed any fever, chills, or weight loss?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’m quite robust, generally. I eat well, I stay active. Weight loss would be…unacceptable. No, no fever, no chills. It’s just this…irritation. I’m a busy man, Doctor. Can we perhaps expedite this? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Antoine, and I'll be as efficient as possible. Let’s take a quick look in your mouth. If you wouldn’t mind opening wide for me. This will just help me get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with.
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There's a white coating on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks. It does appear to be removable with gentle scraping, and there’s some redness underneath. Based on this initial examination, it looks most likely to be oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida yeast. Now, this can happen for a number of reasons, even in healthy individuals. Have you ever used inhaled corticosteroids – like for asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Inhaled corticosteroids? No, absolutely not. I’ve never had asthma or allergies in my life. Perfectly healthy lungs, thank you very much. I am…rather particular about the air I breathe. I avoid pollutants whenever possible. Is this…contagious? My wife and I… well, we share close quarters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No history of inhaled corticosteroid use. And I understand your concern about contagiousness. While it can be spread through saliva, it's not highly contagious, and typically only spreads to those with weakened immune systems or other risk factors. Your wife is unlikely to be affected if she's healthy. Now, sometimes thrush can occur after a course of antibiotics, or if you have a weakened immune system. Have you taken any antibiotics recently, or do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: No antibiotics, Doctor. I avoid them like the plague. And I assure you, my immune system is perfectly functioning. I am a robust individual, as I mentioned previously. I eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly… no underlying conditions whatsoever. This is… rather baffling, isn’t it? To be perfectly frank, I find this whole situation… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: It is a bit unusual given your health history, Antoine. Sometimes it can occur even without a clear risk factor. It's possible your immune system just had a temporary dip. To be certain, we could take a swab to confirm the diagnosis with a lab test, but based on the appearance, I'm fairly confident it's thrush. I'm going to recommend an antifungal mouthwash – nystatin – to rinse twice daily for a week. That should clear it up. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if it worsens, we'll need to consider other possibilities and possibly do that swab. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An antifungal mouthwash… Very well. If it’s a quick solution, I suppose it’s acceptable. But I must reiterate, I have a very busy schedule. I cannot afford to be ill for an extended period. And is there any chance this… this mouthwash will affect my sense of taste? I enjoy a good wine with dinner, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Antoine. Nystatin mouthwash is generally well-tolerated, and the taste is… not the most pleasant, admittedly, but it shouldn't permanently affect your sense of taste. Some people experience a temporary alteration, but it usually resolves quickly after stopping the medication. I would recommend rinsing before dinner if you are concerned about it interfering with your wine. I’ll write you a prescription for nystatin oral suspension. Rinse with 10 milliliters twice daily for seven days. Swish it around in your mouth for about 30 seconds, then spit it out – do not swallow it. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. Simply the prescription, then. I trust this will resolve the matter quickly and efficiently. I have a meeting to attend. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. I'll have the nurse print that prescription for you right away. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. And thank you for coming in. Have a good day, and I hope your meeting goes well.
PATIENT: Good. Thank you, Doctor.
