DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, it's my ears. I've been hearing this ringing sound, like… a high-pitched whine, mostly. It's been going on for a bit now and it's pretty annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears, or tinnitus, is certainly annoying. “A bit now” – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It comes and goes, but it's been pretty constant the last few weeks. It’s worse at night, I think, when it’s quiet. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months with worsening in the last few weeks, and worse at night. Do you notice it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: It's… both, I think. It's hard to tell sometimes, but yeah, definitely in both ears. It feels like it's inside my head, not like something’s actually in my ear, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. It sounds like it's more of a central issue then. Have you noticed any hearing loss along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… not that I've noticed, no. Everything sounds normal, as far as I can tell. Maybe a little muffled sometimes, but I figured that was just because I work in a noisy restaurant all the time. It's pretty loud where I work, you know? Lots of chatter and music.
DOCTOR: Okay, working in a noisy restaurant could certainly be a factor. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No dizziness or feeling sick, and my ears don't feel blocked or anything. Just… the ringing. It’s just really frustrating. It keeps me up at night, like I said, and I can't really concentrate sometimes when it's loud.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent head injuries or been exposed to any really loud noises outside of work—like concerts or shooting firearms?
PATIENT: No head injuries, thankfully. And no, nothing like that either. No concerts or anything. Just the usual restaurant noise, you know? I haven’t been around any extra loud sounds that I can think of. It's just… been gradually getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I had a bit of a bad flu a couple of years back, but nothing serious, just a really bad one. I don't really go to the doctor much, to be honest. Just when I have to. I’m pretty healthy, normally. Divorced, work a lot, try to stay busy, you know? Is this about my blood pressure or something?
DOCTOR: No, not specifically. I’m just trying to get a complete picture of your health. Any past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. They just put a cast on it. Everything else I’ve just… shaken off. I’m a pretty tough guy, I think. Honestly, I just want to get rid of this ringing. It's driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. What about medications?
PATIENT: Not really. I don’t take any regular medication. Just… painkillers sometimes if I pull a muscle at work, but nothing consistently. Just the occasional ibuprofen, that's it. And I have private insurance, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Last question on medical history—any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything. So… what is this, then? Is it something serious? I’ve got work tomorrow, you know? I need to be able to hear the orders.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No allergies, no current medications. It’s good that you have private insurance, too. Alright, Jaylyne. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, nose, and throat, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be quick. Can you sit up here for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… please be quick, okay? I really need to get back to work tomorrow. I don't want to let my manager down. I'm the best waiter there, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to look in your ears now. Nothing to worry about. Hmm, the ear canal looks clear. And this one looks clear as well. No signs of wax buildup or infection. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal, and balance seems fine. Everything looks normal physically. It's hard to say what’s causing the ringing without further testing, but given your work environment, it’s possible it’s noise-induced tinnitus. Do you use ear protection at work?
PATIENT: Ear protection? No. No, we don’t. It’s a restaurant, you know? It’s pretty loud, but… we just deal with it. No one wears earplugs or anything like that. Everyone just… gets used to the noise, I guess. Should we be? Is that what you're saying? I’ve never even thought about it, to be honest. I just figured it was part of the job.
DOCTOR: It absolutely should be. Prolonged exposure to loud noise can cause permanent hearing damage, even if you don't immediately notice it. It can also cause tinnitus like you're experiencing. I recommend you talk to your manager about providing ear protection for all staff. For now, I want to order a hearing test, just to get a baseline and see if there’s any actual hearing loss. I'm also going to recommend a vitamin B12 supplement, as sometimes deficiencies can contribute to tinnitus. And I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication, just to help manage the stress and frustration that the ringing is causing. It won’t cure the tinnitus, but it might make it a little more bearable.
PATIENT: Okay… a hearing test, vitamin B12, and… anti-anxiety medication? Anti-anxiety? I’m not anxious! I just want the ringing to stop. Is it… serious? Like, am I going to go deaf? I really need to be able to hear, you know? It's my job. And what about my manager? What am I supposed to say to him about the ear protection? This is a lot.
DOCTOR: It’s okay. Let’s take this one step at a time. The hearing test is just to get information, to see if there is any measurable hearing loss. It doesn’t mean you're going deaf. And the low-dose anti-anxiety medication is just to help manage the stress that the ringing is causing – it’s a very common symptom of tinnitus. It’s not because you're necessarily anxious, it's just to help you cope. As for your manager, you can explain that you've seen a doctor about the ringing in your ears, and that the doctor recommended ear protection to prevent further damage. You can say you're concerned about your long-term hearing health. It's a reasonable request, and a responsible employer should be willing to provide it. I'll write you a referral to an audiologist for the hearing test, and a prescription for the vitamin B12 and the anti-anxiety medication. I'll also print out some information about tinnitus, so you have a better understanding of the condition. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… a referral, a prescription, information… I guess… no. Not right now. Just… how long will this take? How long until the ringing stops? And… will the medication make me sleepy? I have to be sharp at work, you know? I just… I need to be able to do my job. That's all. And what if it doesn't work? What if the ringing gets worse?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jaylyne. It's completely normal to feel worried in this situation. Let's address each of those questions. Unfortunately, there's no guaranteed timeline for the ringing to stop. The success of the treatment depends on many factors, including the cause of the tinnitus and how long you've been experiencing it. In some cases, it goes away on its own. In others, it can be managed with medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. The anti-anxiety medication I'm prescribing is a low dose, and it’s less likely to cause significant sleepiness. However, everyone reacts differently, so it’s important to start with a small dose and see how you feel. If it does make you sleepy, we can adjust the dosage or try a different medication. As for the ringing getting worse, that's why it’s important to protect your ears now. The sooner you start taking steps to prevent further damage, the better. This information sheet has resources on coping with tinnitus, including relaxation techniques and support groups. And remember, I’m here to support you through this process. If you have any concerns or questions, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Do you have any questions about the referral process or how to pick up your prescriptions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thanks, Doctor. I guess I’ll… I’ll try everything you said. I really appreciate it. And I’ll talk to my manager. Hopefully he’ll listen. Okay. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hopefully, he listens.
