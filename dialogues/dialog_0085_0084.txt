DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s…pleasant to meet you too. Well, it’s been…difficult to say exactly. I’ve been feeling rather…short of breath, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s not a sudden thing, more…gradual, I think. Though, honestly, remembering details is proving tricky.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual onset of shortness of breath and dry mouth… and you're having some trouble with your memory, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. The memory…it’s not gone, exactly. Just…foggy. Like trying to recall a dream. It’s frustrating, truthfully. I don't seem to recall when it started, only that it’s been…some time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this shortness of breath been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It’s…harder to walk longer distances, I suppose. And reading…I find myself needing to pause more often. Writing isn’t as bad, but even that feels…more tiring than it used to. It's…subtle, but it is noticeable. I do enjoy my work, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Kobler?
PATIENT: I am a writer, Doctor. Mostly stories, and…well, various things. It’s…a solitary occupation, generally. Though I enjoy it very much. It’s…how I make my living. I used to do more travelling for research, but…that’s become harder, lately. Because of…everything.
DOCTOR: I see. A writer - that’s wonderful. And it's good you're aware of how this is impacting your ability to do the things you enjoy. Let’s talk a little more about this shortness of breath. Would you say it's constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It…comes and goes, I believe. It’s not always there. But it’s…more frequent now. It seems to worsen with…exertion, naturally. And…when it’s very dry. The air, I mean. If the air is dry, it feels…particularly bothersome. Does that make sense? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. Dry air exacerbating it…and worse with exertion. Okay. Now, aside from the shortness of breath and dry mouth, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have been feeling… rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And…sometimes my eyes feel gritty, even with drops. Oh! And…I've been drinking a lot more water than I used to, because of the dryness. Is that…relevant? It just feels like I’m constantly thirsty.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very relevant. Increased thirst is good information to have. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to listen to your lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your eyes and mouth. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I just…want to understand what is happening, you see. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up here for me. Your lungs sound clear, though your breathing rate is a little elevated. Blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 88, which are both within normal limits. Your eyes appear a little dry, with some mild redness, and your mouth is also quite dry. I also noticed your salivary glands don't appear to be producing much saliva.
PATIENT: That’s…good to hear about my lungs, at least. It's unsettling feeling so…winded. And yes, the dryness has been quite persistent. I've tried various remedies, but nothing seems to offer much relief. Salivary glands, you say? I’m…not sure what that means, exactly. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that your lungs sound clear. We want to rule out anything more serious, of course. As for your salivary glands, they are responsible for producing saliva. Right now, they don’t seem to be working as efficiently as they should be, which explains the dryness in your mouth. Now, to get a better picture of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your past medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… That’s…difficult. I was divorced some years ago, if that is relevant? And I had a rather bad bout of the flu as a child. Beyond that… I don't recall any…diagnoses, specifically. I have always been… reasonably healthy, I believe. Though… my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize if I’m being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all. It’s okay that you don’t recall everything. We’ll work through it. Divorced and a childhood case of the flu aren't directly relevant to your current symptoms. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. No surgeries. I had all my childhood immunizations, if that matters. And… a rather unfortunate incident with a bee sting when I was younger, but it didn’t require surgery. Just a very painful swelling. Honestly, I’ve been quite lucky, health-wise. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you’ve had all your childhood vaccinations. Good. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother…she had some problems with her joints, as she got older. Arthritis, I believe it was. And my father…he was a fisherman, and he had… some breathing difficulties later in life. It might have been related to his profession, I’m not entirely sure. He worked in very harsh conditions. Beyond that… I don't recall much. My family wasn’t… very forthcoming with medical details.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and some breathing difficulties in your father, potentially work-related. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t taken any prescription medications in… years, I believe. Just… occasional over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches, but nothing regularly. I’ve always preferred to avoid medication if possible. I try to… manage things naturally. Though… that’s becoming increasingly difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to…anything, as far as I know. I’ve eaten a variety of foods throughout my life, and I’ve never had any problems. I’m…fairly certain I have no allergies. Though, again, my memory is… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that's infrequent. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a…rather quiet life, generally. Mostly writing, reading, and enjoying the outdoors when the weather permits.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, I want to ask about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do live alone. I was… divorced some years ago, as I mentioned earlier. I have a few…acquaintances, but no close family nearby. I generally prefer my own company, truthfully. It allows me to focus on my writing. It can be…lonely at times, but I manage.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, one final question about your history. Have you travelled outside of the country recently?
PATIENT: Recently… No, not recently. It’s been… years, I believe. I used to travel quite a bit for research, but that was before…everything. I haven’t left the country in a very long time. It's…difficult to recall the exact dates. My memory…is failing me. But no, not recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kobler, thank you for answering all of my questions. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms that could be related to a number of things. Dry mouth and shortness of breath, coupled with your memory issues, could indicate Sjögren’s syndrome, a autoimmune disorder. However, it’s also possible this could be related to medication side effects , dehydration, or even early signs of cognitive impairment. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your inflammatory markers, check your thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also want to check your salivary gland function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and checking my salivary glands… Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If it will help determine what is happening, then please proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… want to understand what is going on, and hopefully find some relief. Sjögren’s syndrome… it sounds… serious. What would that entail, exactly? And… what are the next steps, if it is that?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're asking questions. Sjögren's syndrome can be serious, but it’s also often manageable with treatment. It’s an autoimmune disorder, meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks certain glands in your body, leading to dryness in your eyes and mouth, fatigue, and other symptoms. The blood tests are quite straightforward - just a standard vial of blood drawn from your arm. The salivary gland function test involves collecting a sample of your saliva, which is a non-invasive procedure. If the tests come back positive for Sjögren’s, we’ll discuss treatment options. These typically involve medications to stimulate saliva production, artificial tears to relieve dry eyes, and other supportive therapies to manage your symptoms. We might also refer you to a rheumatologist, a specialist in autoimmune disorders, for further evaluation and management. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We need the test results first. I'll order the tests now. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try to stay well-hydrated, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and use artificial tears as needed to relieve your dry eyes. Do you have any questions about the tests or the next steps?
PATIENT: Stay hydrated… avoid caffeine… artificial tears… Yes, I can manage that. A rheumatologist… That sounds… rather daunting. Will the tests take long? And… what if it’s not Sjögren’s? What else could it be? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just…I’m rather anxious about this.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all with your questions – it's good you're asking them. It’s important to be informed and understand what's happening. The tests should take about a week to come back. We’ll call you as soon as they're available. If it’s not Sjögren’s, there are a number of other possibilities we’ll need to consider. It could be related to medication side effects, even though you’re not currently on any regularly. Dehydration could also be a factor, though you say you're drinking more water. Another possibility is early signs of cognitive impairment, though we’ll need to rule out other causes first. And in rare cases, it could be related to a neurological condition. That’s why it’s important to get a definitive diagnosis before starting any treatment. I’ll write you a prescription for artificial tears, and a list of things to watch for. If you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, rash, or severe fatigue, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Artificial tears…and a list… Yes, that’s helpful. It’s… reassuring to know that there are other possibilities, and that you’re considering everything. No, I believe that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I’ll just…wait for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the lab results come back. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
