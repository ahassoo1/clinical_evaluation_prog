DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I decided it was time to get tested for… HIV. I wanted to get it checked, really. I just… wanted to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health, Ms. Shaub. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit about what prompted you to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Honestly? It’s been on my mind for a while, but seeing a program about it on television… it just made me think I should finally do it. It wasn’t anything specific, just… a reminder, I suppose. My husband and I… we’ve been together a long time, but it’s always best to be sure, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It is always best to be sure, and it's very responsible of you to consider this, regardless of your long-term relationship. Have either you or your husband ever had any reason to be tested before – perhaps due to past medical history or concerns?
PATIENT: No, not really. We… we both were quite careful when we were younger. We didn’t have many partners, and… well, we haven’t really needed to, before now. It's just… things change, you know? I’m not saying anything happened, Doctor, just that I’d rather be safe than sorry. I suppose I just wanted peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. Peace of mind is a very valid reason. Okay, Ms. Shaub, we can definitely do the testing today. We typically use a blood test for HIV. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A blood test is perfectly alright. Is it a lot of blood? I… I don’t usually do well with needles, if I’m honest. Not that I faint or anything, just… a little uneasy.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a lot of blood at all, Ms. Shaub – just a few vials. And I understand completely about needles. We can take it slow, and the nurse is very good at making people comfortable. Before we proceed, let's go over a brief medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get the occasional mosquito bite that swelled up, but nothing serious. And… I think that’s it. I haven’t taken much in the way of medication over the years, honestly. Just over-the-counter things for headaches, occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even those over-the-counter headache remedies, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at the moment. I did use some ibuprofen a few weeks back for a bit of back pain, but that was just for a couple of days, and I've stopped now. Nothing regular, I assure you. I try to manage things with rest and heat packs when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any significant medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago, and I had a bit of a bad bout of pneumonia when I was in my twenties. But other than that, I’ve been quite fortunate with my health, really. I’ve always been a strong woman. Nothing major, I promise you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a little harder. My parents… they passed away quite a while ago, and I wasn't really involved in their medical details, if I'm honest. They weren't ones for sharing such things. I have a sister, though, who is still alive, but we aren’t very close. I don’t know much about her health either, unfortunately. I don't think there's anything major on either side, but I can’t be certain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Ms. Shaub. We can work with what you know. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. Never have, never will. My husband used to enjoy a little brandy on special occasions, but he's stopped now, years ago. He says it wasn't agreeing with his stomach. We both prefer a nice cup of tea, if we're being honest. A quiet life, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s very helpful. Now, just to complete the history, could you tell me your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s a bit embarrassing. I’m rather tall, I suppose. About six foot two, maybe? And… well, I’ve put on a little weight over the years. Around two hundred pounds, I’d say. Perhaps a bit more. I haven’t been on a scale in a while. It’s not something I dwell on, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub, that’s perfectly alright. Thank you for sharing. So, to recap: no allergies, no current medications, tonsillectomy as a child, pneumonia in your twenties, no significant family history you’re aware of, no smoking, alcohol, or drug use, height approximately six foot two, and weight around two hundred pounds. Now, before we proceed with the blood draw for the HIV test, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I mostly just want to get it done, really. Knowing is better than wondering, I suppose. I trust your judgement. Just… how long will it take to get the results? That's probably my biggest worry.
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to process the results. We’ll give you a call as soon as they're available. If we don’t hear back within a week, please give us a call to follow up. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you very much for your time and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I suppose it’s time for the blood draw.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shaub. I’ll have the nurse come in and take care of that for you. Just relax, and she'll make it as comfortable as possible. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
