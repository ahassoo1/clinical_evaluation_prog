DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. I see you're 90 years young – that’s wonderful! To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Petrimoulx, you say? A pretty name. What was I… ah. Yes. The cough. It's just… been hanging on. A dry cough. Seems to get worse when… well, I don't rightly remember when exactly. Just… a while now. It’s mostly just annoying, really. Doesn’t hurt, not much. Just…tickles and then… hack. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do know, Mr. Pavlovec. A persistent cough can certainly be bothersome. So, it's a dry cough that's been going on for a while now, and it doesn't seem to cause you pain, just irritation. Can you tell me a little more about when it started, even if it's just a general timeframe – was it weeks ago, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Months, I think. Maybe longer? It's hard to say. Things… blur, you know? After my wife… after Eleanor passed, everything sort of…lost its clear edges. I was probably busy with… arrangements then, and didn’t notice it starting. Then it was just… there. Not awful, just… a constant little bother. I tried some cough drops, the cherry ones. Didn’t do much good, though. Eleanor always had the good cough drops... the honey lemon ones.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovec. Losing Eleanor must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s very common for things to feel…less distinct during times of grief. It’s perfectly understandable that you might not remember exactly when the cough started. So, we’re looking at several months, at least. And the cherry cough drops haven’t provided much relief. Besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little…winded, sometimes. Just walking from the kitchen to the living room. But I’m an old man, Doctor. I figure that’s just… getting old. Not much energy, either. Been sleeping more. But… well, I always liked my naps. I don’t know if that's new or not. Nothing serious, I don't think. No fever, no chest pain… just tired and a little… wheezy, sometimes, when I try to take a deep breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Mr. Pavlovec. So, some shortness of breath with activity, increased fatigue, and a little wheezing when you take a deep breath, in addition to the cough. No fever or chest pain, which is good. Now, I'd like to ask a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a long time ago. I saw a doctor… when I was working, of course. Had to for the job. Automotive work isn't easy on the body. I think… I think they said my blood pressure was a little high, once. They put me on some pills for it. Red ones, I think. Took them for a while. Stopped taking them when I retired. Didn't see much point, then. No diabetes… Eleanor always worried about that one, but I never had it. Mostly just aches and pains, from bending over cars all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. So, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure that was treated with medication for a time, but you’re not currently taking anything for it. And generally just aches and pains related to your automotive work. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh! Yes. My appendix. When I was a young man. Very sick. They had to cut me open, of course. That was… a long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia repaired, too. Something about lifting heavy things… which I did a lot of. That was after the war. No, I don’t think… I don’t think I’ve had any other surgeries. Just those two. It was a simpler time, then. Doctors didn't do so much… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Appendix removal and a hernia repair, both in your younger years. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are your parents still living, or if not, do you know what medical conditions they had?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both gone now, a long time ago. My mother… she died young, from… I think it was pneumonia. Very sudden. My father… he lived to be quite old. But he had…trouble breathing, towards the end. The doctor said it was his lungs. Something about working in the mines when he was young. Lots of dust. He coughed a lot, too, towards the end. Not like mine, though. More… rattling, I suppose. And Eleanor’s mother… she had something with her heart, I think. But I never paid much attention to the details. Women's health… always a bit of a mystery to me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s common not to remember all the details of family medical history. So, your mother passed away from pneumonia, your father had breathing difficulties related to his work in the mines, and your mother-in-law had a heart condition. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I live alone, now. Been that way for… too long. I mostly stay inside. Read a bit. Watch some TV. Not much energy to do much else. I try to walk to the mailbox every day, but it gets harder all the time. I used to garden, but… well, my knees aren't what they used to be. I don't smoke. Never did. And I don’t drink much anymore, either. Just a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Eleanor always liked a glass of wine. I eat… well, I eat whatever’s easy. Canned soup, mostly. Frozen dinners. Not much cooking these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. So, you live alone, enjoy reading and watching TV, and try to stay active with short walks. You don’t smoke or drink excessively, and your diet consists mostly of convenience foods. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees. The arthritis, you know? It’s a cream, mostly. I rub it on at night. Helps a little. And sometimes I take a pain reliever… when they really bother me. Over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think. That’s all. Nothing regular, really. I don’t believe in taking a lot of pills. My wife always said they just mask the problem… and she was usually right about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a topical cream for arthritis and occasional ibuprofen for knee pain. Thank you for that information, Mr. Pavlovec. Alright, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds… sensible. Go ahead. I suppose poking and prodding is necessary, even if I don't much like it. Just be gentle, Doctor. My bones aren't what they used to be. And I might… might need a moment to get up. It gets harder every day, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovec. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We can take things at your pace, and I’ll assist you getting up or moving around as needed. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 85. And I’m hearing a slight murmur, which is common in people your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, listening to your lungs, I hear some wheezing, particularly when you breathe out. And I notice your breathing is a little bit labored. Your knees are a little swollen and tender to the touch. Okay, Mr. Pavlovec, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, likely exacerbated by your history of breathing difficulties and potential exposure to irritants. Your knee arthritis is also contributing to your limited mobility. However, further testing is needed to confirm this. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: COPD… That sounds… serious. My father had something with his lungs, you said. Is that what I have? And a chest X-ray… I haven't had one of those in… goodness, I don't even remember. Testing… well, I suppose it's necessary. If you think it's best. But I'm an old man, Doctor. I don’t know if… if poking and prodding is worth it at this age. Is it something that can be… fixed? Or is it just… going to get worse?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s natural to feel anxious about new diagnoses and tests, especially at your age. COPD can be serious, but it’s also manageable with proper treatment. Your father’s lung condition could certainly be a contributing factor, but we need the tests to confirm if that’s what you’re dealing with. And I completely understand your hesitation about further testing. However, these tests will help us determine the severity of your condition and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. It’s not necessarily about “fixing” it, but rather about slowing down the progression of the disease, managing your symptoms, and improving your quality of life. The chest X-ray is a relatively simple procedure and will give us a good initial look at your lungs. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a machine, and it will measure how much air you can inhale and exhale. If the tests confirm a diagnosis of COPD, treatment options include inhalers to open your airways, pulmonary rehabilitation to improve your breathing, and lifestyle changes like quitting smoking and avoiding irritants. We can discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: Inhalers… like my sister used to use. She had asthma, I think. And… avoiding irritants. What sort of irritants? Dust? I live in an old house, Doctor. There's dust everywhere. Alright… alright, schedule the tests. But… please, make it easy. I don’t do well with… complicated things. And… let me know the results as soon as you can. I don’t want to be left wondering.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovec. I will make sure the testing process is as easy and comfortable as possible. We have a very kind technician who will walk you through each step, and I’ll be available to answer any questions you have. We'll start with the chest X-ray, which can be done at the clinic next door. Then, we'll schedule the pulmonary function test for a few days later. As for irritants, dust is certainly one, but also things like strong perfumes, cleaning products, and even cold air can trigger symptoms. We can discuss strategies to minimize your exposure once we know the results of your tests. I will have my assistant schedule the tests for you now, and she will provide you with clear instructions and contact information. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. You should receive a call within a week. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not… dismissing me as just an old man. It’s easy to feel… invisible, sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Pavlovec. It’s my pleasure. You are not just an old man, and your concerns are very valid. I take the time to listen to each of my patients, and I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease, even if just a little. My assistant, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule those tests. Don’t hesitate to ask her if you have any questions. Please take care of yourself, Mr. Pavlovec. And remember, I'm here for you.
