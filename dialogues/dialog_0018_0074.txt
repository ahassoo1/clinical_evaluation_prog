DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Just call me Venna. Well, it’s my blood pressure. Been runnin’ a little high, the nurse said at the last check-up. She told me to come see you about it. I’m not much for fuss, so I figured I'd best get it looked at.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It’s wise to address these things promptly. “A little high” can mean different things to different people, so let’s get a better understanding. Do you happen to recall what the nurse said your blood pressure reading was at that last check-up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… numbers ain’t my strong suit, Doctor. I think she said somethin' like… one-hundred and forty-somethin’ over ninety-somethin’? But honestly, it all kinda blurred together. I mostly remember her lookin’ concerned. I bake a lot, see, and I get distracted easy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. Numbers can be confusing, and it’s much more important that you recognized her concern. Approximately 140/90 is what I need to know. We’ll confirm that here today, of course. Now, have you noticed any symptoms that might be related to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast, but I figured that was just my age catchin’ up to me. And sometimes a bit of a headache, but I get those too, from bein’ in the sun too long while I’m gettin’ berries for my pies. I don’t think either one’s been… bad enough to worry about.
DOCTOR: Dizziness upon standing and occasional headaches... thank you for sharing that, Venna. It’s good that you’re observant of these things. Those could be related to blood pressure, or they could be something else entirely. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Old Man Tiber, the doctor before Doctor Stilaire, he said I had a touch of arthritis in my hands years ago. But it mostly just aches a bit when it’s cold. And I had the flu real bad when I was younger, but everyone gets that, right? Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I reckon.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna. Arthritis and a past bout of the flu… noted. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. And I’ve been lucky enough to stay outta the hospital, thankfully. Always been able to patch myself up with a good poultice and some rest, or lean on my husband when he was still here. Though… he did break his leg once fallin’ off the roof, mendin’ it himself mostly, stubborn man he was. But that was him, not me!
DOCTOR: I see. Just to be thorough, I like to ask about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else that seems common?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a long story. My mama, she lived to be a good old age, but her heart gave out in the end. And my brother, bless his soul, he had somethin’ with his sugar, always eatin’ sweets, he was. High blood pressure… I don’t rightly know. We didn’t talk much about sickness back then. Folks just… dealt with it. Didn't have doctors visitin' all the time like now.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Venna. It’s helpful to know about your mother's heart condition and your brother's diabetes, even without a lot of detail. Now, could you tell me a little about your daily habits?
PATIENT: Habits, huh? Well, I wake up early, make a fire, and start bakin’ for the day. Pies mostly, but sometimes bread too. I walk to the store when I need supplies, though it’s gettin’ harder with my legs achin’. I drink a lot of water, and… I reckon I eat a fair amount of sugar, with all the bakin’. Can't make a good pie without it, now can ya?
DOCTOR: Certainly not! A good pie does require sugar. Now, do you use any tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Lord no, Doctor. Never touched a drop of liquor or any of that stuff. My mama always said it clouded the mind, and I need my mind sharp for bakin’. And tobacco… makes me cough just thinkin’ about it. No, just good clean air and a strong cup of tea for me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to nothin’. I eat most everything… except maybe those canned peaches. They just don't taste right. But that ain't an allergy, just a matter of taste, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. That’s all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure, of course. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've had doctors poke and prod at me before. Long as you're gentle, I suppose I can handle it. Just try not to make a fuss, alright? I get nervous easy.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let's take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… that’s good. Okay… Your blood pressure is currently 152/88. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit strong. I can hear some mild crackling in your lungs, which could be from a number of things. Your pulse is 78 and steady. Now, I’m going to listen to your back.
PATIENT: Cracklin’ in my lungs, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I reckon I ain’t been coughin’ much, just a little tickle sometimes. Is it somethin’ serious? I'm gettin’ a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking, Venna. The crackling is mild, and it’s not necessarily serious. It could be due to a number of things—like a little fluid buildup, or even just a previous cold. Because of your age and the blood pressure reading, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Before we get to that, though, I’d also like to draw some blood for a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. That will give us a better overall picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays and blood tests… oh my. Seems like a lot, Doctor. I don't like hospitals much, and I don't like needles any better. But… if you think it’s best, I reckon I can handle it. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try not to fuss. Is it gonna hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Venna. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood draw is quick – just a small pinch, and it will be over before you know it. And the X-ray is completely painless. The lab work and the X-ray can be done here at the clinic today. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to reduce your salt intake. Less salt can help lower your blood pressure. And I'd like you to keep a log of your blood pressure readings at home, if you’re able. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't have one of those fancy blood pressure cuffs. My nurse just checked it when I went for my yearly check-up. Salt, you say? Oh dear, that’s gonna be hard. I use salt in all my bakin'! But… if it'll help, I reckon I can try. I just don't know how I'll taste if I don't put enough salt in it. What about sugar? You said somethin' about that too.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask about the sugar. Reducing sugar intake is also important, but let’s focus on the salt first. Small changes can make a big difference. As for your baking… perhaps we can experiment with some salt substitutes or reduce the amount gradually. It may take some adjusting, but we’ll figure it out together. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for the blood tests and an order for the chest X-ray. The lab and radiology departments are just down the hall. Do you need me to call someone to come with you, or are you comfortable going on your own?
PATIENT: I reckon I can manage on my own. It’s just down the hall, you said? Old legs work alright for short distances. But… could you maybe write down the names of the places I need to go? My memory ain’t what it used to be, and I’m afraid I’ll forget. And... thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. It’s my pleasure. Here you go. The lab is first, it’s just around the corner to your left. They'll take a small sample of your blood. Afterwards, the radiology department is down the hall to your right, and they'll take the chest X-ray. After you have those done, please call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment. We'll review the results and discuss a plan of action. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I’ll go get those tests done now, and I'll be sure to call when I'm ready to come back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask the staff at the lab and radiology department if you have any questions. And remember, we’re here to help. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please, take care of yourself.
