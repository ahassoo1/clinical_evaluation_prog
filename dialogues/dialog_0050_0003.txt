DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, it’s this…shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been going on a bit, I suppose. Honestly, I don't remember when it started, but my daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come. She worries too much. It’s just…annoying, is what it is.
DOCTOR: Annoying, you say. I understand. However, even 'annoying' symptoms warrant investigation, Mr. Baide. To help me understand this shaking a bit better, could you describe it in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? It…wiggles. My hands wiggle when I try to do things. Like, if I'm trying to hold a fork…or sign my name. It’s worse when I’m nervous, I think. Or tired. Though, truthfully, I’m always tired these days. It’s not like it’s a big deal, you know? It’s just…makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Difficult is a useful descriptor, Mr. Baide. And frequency is helpful too. Is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… hmm. I… I really don't know. Honestly, doc, I don't sit around watching my hands shake all day! I have things to do. It’s there sometimes, and sometimes it isn’t. When I'm resting, I think it's better. But then again, I probably just don’t notice it as much. Look, is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, a thorough medical evaluation requires accurate information, and that includes your observations. Rest assured, I aim to be efficient. But rushing through this won't benefit either of us. Now, regarding other symptoms… have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain associated with this shaking?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Just…frustration. Stiffness… maybe a little in the mornings, but who doesn't get a little stiff in the mornings at my age? Honestly, doc, I'm a busy man. I used to be a big producer, you know. Directed a lot of things. Important things. This is all…well, it's silly. I'm sure it's nothing.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your willingness to minimize this, Mr. Baide, dismissing potential concerns based on a subjective feeling of 'silliness' isn't sound medical practice. Let's move on to a brief review of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Conditions? Oh, jeez. Let me think… My heart's a little…fluttery sometimes, the doctor told me years ago. Gave me some pills, I think. Don't really remember taking them for very long. And my knees… well, they ain’t what they used to be. Arthritis, probably. The usual old man stuff. Look, I get Medicare, if that helps. Honestly, I don't keep track of all this.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful information, thank you. And while "the usual old man stuff" is a common sentiment, Mr. Baide, it’s crucial to have specifics. Do you recall the name of the medication you were prescribed for your heart?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking too much! Name of a pill from twenty years ago? I haven't the faintest! Little white thing, I think. Or maybe it was blue? Honestly, doc, I had a life. I was running things, not memorizing pill colors. It's all a blur, alright? Is this going to involve poking and prodding? Because I really don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, a physical examination is a standard component of any medical assessment, and it will involve some observation and palpation. It is necessary to properly evaluate your condition. However, we can begin with a more general question. Have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination recently?
PATIENT: Balance? Well… I suppose I’m a little steadier on my feet now than I used to be. My daughter worries about me falling. Though that's just her being…overprotective. I haven't fallen, have I? No, I don’t think so. Look, I'm getting a headache now. Can we just wrap this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, your dismissive attitude and lack of detailed recollection are… unhelpful. However, I will proceed. Let's attempt a brief neurological examination. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect miracles, doc. These hands aren’t what they used to be. And if you try to make me hop or something, I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Baide, no hopping is required. Now, please keep your arms extended, palms up, and try to tap your thumb against each of your fingers in sequence. I am simply assessing your motor skills. …Now, can you tell me if you have any family history of similar shaking or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, jeez. My mother had… something. Her hands shook when she got old, I think. But she also drank a lot of coffee, so who knows? My father was a strong, silent type. Never complained about anything. Honestly, doc, my family wasn’t one for sharing feelings or medical details. Are we almost done here? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will conduct a quick assessment of your gait and reflexes. Please stand and walk a few steps for me. Now, please sit back down. I would like to check your reflexes. Based on my brief examination, and your provided history, I suspect you may be experiencing the early stages of essential tremor, possibly complicated by mild parkinsonism. However, further investigation is required to confirm this. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and potential imaging studies, such as a DaTscan.
PATIENT: Essential tremor? Parkinsonism? What are you even talking about? That sounds… serious. And a DaTscan? Is that going to cost me a fortune? Look, doc, I just want the shaking to stop. I don't need fancy tests and complicated diagnoses. Can't you just give me a pill or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. However, proper diagnosis is essential for appropriate treatment. Simply prescribing a "pill" without understanding the underlying cause could be ineffective, or even harmful. A neurologist can perform more specialized tests to determine the exact nature of your condition and recommend the most suitable course of action. I will provide you with a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist in the area. She will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I can prescribe a low-dose beta-blocker, propranolol, which may help to manage some of the tremor symptoms. However, this is merely symptomatic relief, and does not address the underlying cause. I will also provide you with a list of resources regarding essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Beta-blocker…fine. Whatever. As long as it helps. Honestly, I don’t need to read about diseases. I have a disease, apparently. And I really don’t have time for a lengthy discussion about it. Just… give me the prescription and the referral. I think that's enough for today, doc. I have a lunch appointment, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. As you wish. The prescription is for propranolol 40mg twice daily. Please follow up with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. I strongly advise you to read the information I provided, despite your stated reluctance. Understanding your condition is crucial, even if you choose not to acknowledge it. Should you experience any adverse effects from the medication, such as dizziness, fatigue, or shortness of breath, discontinue use and contact my office immediately. I wish you a pleasant day, Mr. Baide. .
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever. Don't bother calling, doc. I'll manage. .
