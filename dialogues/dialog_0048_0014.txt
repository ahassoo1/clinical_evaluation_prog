DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, everyone just calls me Ron. It’s… a bit hard to keep track of things these days, you know? I’m here about some paperwork, I think. Something about… time off? My wife helped me set this up.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Your wife brought you in for… what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, that's the thing. I think it’s for… taking some time away from work? I’m a director with… religious activities and education. It’s… it’s been a little difficult lately, remembering everything, keeping up with it all. I believe she said something about… FMLA? Or maybe disability? Honestly, it all blurs together. She was worried I was pushing myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Right. And… what specifically is difficult?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not one thing, exactly. More like… gaps. I’ll be in the middle of something – planning a lesson, organizing an event – and then… just poof. Can’t recall what I was doing, or why. It's frustrating, you know? It’s not like I'm completely out of it, but… things slip. Names, dates, details… They just don’t stick like they used to. And I’m getting tired… more tired than usual. It makes it hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It feels like it’s been creeping up on me for… well, a while now. Maybe six months? Maybe longer? It's hard to pinpoint, honestly. It started subtly, little things… forgetting where I put my keys, missing an appointment. Now… well, now it’s more noticeable. My wife definitely noticed first, kept telling me I was repeating myself. She’s got a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. I mean, I sleep alright, I guess. Appetite’s okay. No pain, no dizziness… just… forgetful. And tired. Really tired. Sometimes I feel a little… cloudy, like there’s cotton in my head. But nothing major, you know? I wouldn't say I'm sick, sick. Just… getting old, maybe? Though, my wife thinks it’s more than that. She’s usually right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother, she had some trouble towards the end, I remember. Not really sure what it was, though. Just… confused a lot. My father was pretty sharp right up until the very end. No, I don’t think so… not that I can recall, anyway. It’s been a while since I thought about family history, to be honest. My wife keeps track of all that stuff. She’s the organized one.
DOCTOR: And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see... . I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a Vitamin D supplement, my wife thought I wasn't getting enough sunshine. That's it. Nothing else. Just those two. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and fruit, but it's hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick cognitive assessment. Just a few simple questions, to get a baseline. It won't be extensive.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. That sounds… fine. I’m not very good with tests, if that’s alright. I always get nervous. But, sure. Whatever you need. Just let me know what to do. I hope it doesn't take too long. I'm not sure how much I can concentrate right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today’s date… August… let me see… is it the 1st? No… my wife told me… August 2nd, right? Yes, August 2nd. 2025, is it? I think so. It’s hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Three words… Okay, go ahead. I'll try my best. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Just tell them to me slowly.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay. Apple, table, penny. Apple… table… um… cherry? No… peanut? I can’t… I can't remember the last one! It was something… small and round… Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll stop there for now. I think we have enough to go on. It’s possible you’re experiencing some early cognitive changes. It could be a number of things. I’m not going to jump to any conclusions. But I do think it’s worth getting some further testing done.
PATIENT: Oh. Further testing? What kind of testing? Is it… serious? My wife will be very concerned. She’s been saying something wasn’t quite right for a while, but I didn't want to worry her. What do you think it is, doctor? Is it… the beginning of something bad?
DOCTOR: It's likely nothing severe, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation – some blood work and possibly an MRI. It's standard procedure. As for what it could be... it's too early to say. Could be stress, a vitamin deficiency, or simply age-related changes. Don't jump to conclusions. I’ll have my assistant schedule the appointment for you. It's best to get it checked out sooner rather than later.
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI? I’ve never had an MRI before. Is it… painful? And a neurologist… that sounds serious. My wife… she’s going to be so worried. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything to help my memory? I’ve been trying to write things down, but I keep forgetting where I put the list! This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The MRI is non-invasive, Mr. Limtiaco. It's just a scan. And the neurologist is simply a specialist. They'll provide a more detailed assessment. As for your memory… try to maintain a regular routine. That’s the best thing you can do. Avoid stress, eat a healthy diet, and get plenty of sleep. Writing things down is fine, but don’t obsess over it. I’ll provide you with a referral and some basic information about the neurologist’s office. My assistant will handle the details. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that's all. Just the paperwork for… time off, if you could. For my work. My wife will probably need to handle all the details, honestly. I'm not very good with paperwork. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your time. Even if it is… a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Right. My assistant will handle everything. Have a good day, Mr. Limtiaco. .
PATIENT: .
