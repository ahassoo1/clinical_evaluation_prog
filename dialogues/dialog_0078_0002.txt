DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Lessie Solero, and I'm one of the family medicine doctors here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Stoffregen is right. Zoie Stoffregen. Um… what was I saying? Oh, yes. It’s… the pee. It's hard to… go. It just takes a long time, you know? Not… painful, just… slow. It's been going on for… a little while now, I think. I don’t really keep track of those things anymore. My husband usually notices first.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t keep precise track. “A little while now” is helpful enough to start. So, it sounds like you've noticed it's taking longer to urinate, and it's not causing you any pain, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. No pain. Just… frustrating. Especially at night, sometimes. I don’t want to wake my Harold, you see. He needs his sleep. He's getting old too, you know? Not as old as me, but… still. And it feels like… I don't finish all the time? Like there's still some left in there, even when I think I'm done. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining it very well.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. You're explaining it very well. It sounds like you're experiencing difficulty starting your urine stream, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and it’s more noticeable at night. Those are all important details. And it's thoughtful of you to consider your husband's sleep. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about how frequently you're needing to urinate during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… how often? Hmm. Let me think. During the day… I suppose… normal? I drink a lot of water, you see. Harold makes sure of that. He always has a pitcher ready for me. I go… when I need to go, I guess. Not… a lot more than usual. Maybe two or three times before dinner, and then… once or twice after. I really couldn't say. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. Is that helpful? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s alright if it’s not a precise number. So, you're drinking a good amount of water, and the frequency hasn’t changed drastically. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, let me see… Not that I've noticed. Maybe… a little more tired lately? But that could just be old age, you know? Harold says I sleep a lot. He worries about me. Um… sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I get up too fast, but I always have since I was a young woman, so I don't know if that's related. And… oh! My feet swell up a bit at the end of the day, but that happens too. I don’t really keep track of what’s normal and what’s not anymore. It's all a bit much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been aware of some fatigue, occasional dizziness, and some swelling in your feet. Those are all important things to mention. And it's very common for things to change as we get older, so you’re right to consider that. Now, thinking about your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a hard one. Let me think… I had a bad heart once, a long time ago. They fixed it, though. A long operation. I don’t remember much about it. Harold says I have high blood pressure, but he manages my medicine. He’s very good with all those things. And… I think I had the flu a few times. Does that count? I've been to the doctor a lot over the years, of course, but I don't remember what for, mostly. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember everything. So, it sounds like you have a history of a heart condition that was treated surgically, and Harold manages your blood pressure with medication. That's important information. Do you take any other medications besides those for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me think. Harold gives me pills every morning. For my bones, he says. Something about keeping them strong. And sometimes a little something for my tummy. I get heartburn sometimes, you see. And a little blue pill, but that’s… different. That’s for… well, never you mind. Harold says they’re important, so I take them. I don't really ask what they are. He knows best. I just take what he gives me. Is that okay? I’m terrible at remembering all of this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. It's very common to have several medications, and it's good that Harold helps you manage them. We'll want to get a complete list to ensure everything is documented. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to get itchy when I touched poison ivy as a little girl, but that was a long time ago. Harold says I have sensitive skin, so he buys me special soap. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. No known allergies is helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Harold always says I should listen to the doctor. He's a very sensible man. I'm a bit cold, though. It's chilly in here. Would it be alright if I kept my sweater on? It’s my favorite, you see. Knitted it myself, years ago.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. Please, keep your sweater on. We can absolutely keep you comfortable. And it's a beautiful sweater – you did a lovely job. Okay, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern given your history. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does that cause you any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just… a bit of a rumble, sometimes. My tummy gets upset easily, you see. Harold says it’s my age. He gives me special tea. It helps a little. You’re pressing… right there… a bit tender, but nothing terrible. Like a little ache. It’s been like that for a while now, I think. Is that bad? I don't want to worry you.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Stoffregen. A little tenderness is not necessarily alarming, especially given your history. It’s helpful to know its location. I am now going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but again, that’s not necessarily a cause for alarm given your age. Now, I’d like to get a urine sample if that's possible. There's a cup in the restroom. It will help us rule out any infection. Do you think you’d be able to collect that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the pee again. Yes, yes, I can do that. It's just… embarrassing, you know? Having trouble. And going in a cup… But if you need it, I'll do it. I'll try to be quick. Harold always says I take too long in the bathroom. But that’s just because… well, never you mind. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. Take your time. There’s no rush at all. I’ll be right here when you're ready. And don't worry, this is a very common part of the evaluation process.
PATIENT: Here you go, dear. I did my best. It took a little while, you know? But I got it. I hope it’s enough. I feel a little silly, handing you my pee. But if it helps, then… well. Harold always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Thank you very much, Ms. Stoffregen. You did perfectly fine. It's perfectly normal to feel a little self-conscious, but you’ve been very cooperative, and I appreciate it. Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, the preliminary results of the urine test are back, and they don’t show any signs of infection, which is good. However, there is some protein in your urine, and there are a few white blood cells present. That could indicate inflammation in the kidneys, or it could be related to other factors. Given your history of a heart condition, the difficulty with urination, and these urine findings, I'd like to recommend a few additional tests. A blood test to check your kidney function, and a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. They are the specialists in urinary issues and can perform more detailed tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Tests and specialists… It all sounds a bit much, dear. I’m already so tired. And Harold… he gets so worried when I have to go to lots of different doctors. He likes to keep things simple. But… if you think it's important, then I suppose I should do it. I don’t want to get sicker. Is the blood test very painful? And… a urologist? What do they do? I don’t like the sound of that. I just want my pee to go back to normal. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The blood test is just a simple prick of the finger or the inside of the elbow – it’s quick and usually not very painful. A urologist specializes in the urinary system – they can perform tests to see exactly what’s causing your difficulty urinating and recommend the best course of treatment. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, and seeing a specialist is often the best way to get a clear answer. We can start with the blood test and then schedule an appointment with the urologist if the results warrant it. We don't have to make any decisions right now. Would you like me to order the blood test for you?
PATIENT: Yes… alright, the blood test. If it's quick, then I suppose I can manage that. And… don't schedule the urologist yet. Let's see what the blood test says first. Harold always says we shouldn't jump to conclusions. He’s very sensible, you know? And… will you explain everything to Harold? He gets so anxious when he doesn’t understand what’s going on. He worries about me constantly. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be happy to explain everything to Harold. I understand his concerns, and I will make sure he feels informed and comfortable with the plan. Okay, I've ordered the blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the sample anytime. They'll give you instructions on how to fast beforehand, if necessary. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water. And if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so, dear. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I just hope it’s nothing serious. Harold will be relieved to hear you’ll talk to him. He worries so much. Thank you for being so kind and patient with an old woman like me. It’s nice to know someone is looking out for me. I think that’s all for now. I should probably go home and rest. My bones are aching.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It was my pleasure to meet you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I will call Harold shortly to discuss the results and schedule a follow-up. Take care of yourself, and get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. .
