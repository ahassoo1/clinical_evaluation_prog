DOCTOR: Hi Candis, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's just get to it. I'm tired. Really tired. And I... well, it's embarrassing, but I've been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something's wrong. It just… tastes good, sometimes. Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: No judgment here at all, Candis. It's good you're being honest with me – that's the most important thing. Eating dirt... okay. That's certainly unusual, and we'll figure out what's going on. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a while now. Maybe a couple of months? It comes and goes, you know? Not every day. When I'm really, really tired, it's worse. And I haven't been eating properly, I suppose. No appetite, really. Just... not hungry. Though, I can’t say I’ve tried to eat much of anything. It all feels… pointless.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, and it seems linked to your fatigue. And you’ve noticed a decreased appetite as well. Can you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: It's just… everything is hard. Getting out of bed, walking to the store, even just… thinking. I used to be so active, always doing something. Now? I just want to sit. And sleep. But even that doesn't help much. I wake up feeling just as tired as when I went to bed. It’s… frustrating, to say the least. And don't tell me to "get more exercise." I've heard it all before.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly draining, and I definitely won’t suggest more exercise. It’s good you're telling me this. It sounds like this fatigue is really impacting your quality of life. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and the… dirt eating?
PATIENT: Dirt eating... you make it sound so clinical. Fine, pica. Happy? Honestly, it’s not the main problem, it’s just… there. Anyway, let me think. My stomach… it's been a bit off. Not constantly sick, but a little queasy sometimes. And I've been… colder than usual. Even in the summer. I used to run hot. Now I'm always wrapped in a blanket. Is that all you need to know? I really have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, not all, Candis, but that’s helpful. Stomach upset and feeling colder than usual – that’s good to know. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now you’re asking about… that? Really? Look, I’m a private person. But fine, if you must know, it’s been… different. Darker, I suppose. And not as often. Honestly, I try not to think about it. I don't need to discuss my bathroom habits with a doctor, thank you very much. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Candis, and I apologize for asking personal questions. But these details are important. Darker and less frequent bowel movements...okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. And weight loss… maybe a little? I haven’t really been keeping track. Clothes fit a bit looser, I suppose. But I haven’t been eating much, so that makes sense, doesn’t it? I don’t have a scale and I certainly don't go around weighing myself. I’m not obsessed with my weight, if that’s what you’re thinking. Can we please get to the point? Is this a vitamin deficiency or what? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Okay. It could be a vitamin deficiency, possibly iron related, given the pica and fatigue. However, we need to rule out other causes, as well. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and then order some blood tests, if that's alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to sit here all day. And don't bother explaining every little thing you're doing. Just… do it. I have a life, you know. And if it's just going to be a bunch of needles and poking, just let me know now. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your abdomen. I'll also take your blood pressure. I will let you know what I am doing before I do it, and I will try to minimize any discomfort. First, let's just take your blood pressure. It's a simple cuff around your arm. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, I don't see what poking and prodding is going to do. I’m tired, not broken. But fine, whatever. Just… don’t take all day. And don’t tell me to breathe deeply. I know how to breathe.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 102 over 68. A little on the low side, but not terribly concerning given your overall presentation. Now, if you'll allow me, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. It’s just placing the stethoscope on your chest. Can you take some nice, normal breaths for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry up. I have a feeling this is going to be a waste of my time. I’m perfectly healthy, I just need a good rest. Honestly, all this fuss over a little dirt… It’s ridiculous. sigh Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are clear, but a little fast. Your lungs sound good – nice and clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. I'm just checking for any swelling or masses. Okay, your abdomen feels a little tender here on the left side, but otherwise feels normal.
PATIENT: Ugh. That was unpleasant. Honestly, you're making me more anxious than I was before. Look, can we just skip the blood tests and give me something for the fatigue? I’m not asking for anything fancy, just something to make me feel normal again. I haven't got time for endless tests and poking and prodding. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I'm being treated like a child.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. However, I can't prescribe medication without knowing the cause of your fatigue and other symptoms. Blood tests are necessary to rule out serious conditions like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. Without that information, I could potentially be masking a more serious underlying problem. We'll just need a small sample of blood. It's a quick procedure, and it will give us valuable information. We can check your complete blood count, iron levels, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: Fine. But I'm warning you, if it turns out to be nothing, I'm not paying for it. And don’t expect me to come back if it's just a waste of my time. Honestly, all this fuss over being a little tired and eating dirt...It’s ridiculous. Just get it over with. Quickly. And try not to miss. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll let you know exactly what I'm doing before I do it. And I assure you, I’m very skilled at drawing blood. We'll start with a small sample, and it will only take a few minutes. Okay, just relax your arm for me. You might feel a brief pinch, and then it will be over.
PATIENT: Just… hurry up. And don’t look at me like I’m a child. I'm perfectly capable of handling a little prick. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is just… awful. I need a nap. A long nap. sigh Get it over with. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. Here’s a bandage. You did great. Now, the lab should have the results back in a few days. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. We can then discuss the results and decide on a plan. In the meantime, I recommend getting some rest, and eating a well-balanced diet, if you can. And I want to reiterate, I take your concerns seriously, Candis. We're going to figure out what's going on. .
