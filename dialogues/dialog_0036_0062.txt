DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. I am a Protective Service Worker, and there's been a new requirement… about masks. I’m hoping to discuss getting an exemption, if that’s possible. I’ve found them… difficult to tolerate.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A mask exemption for your work as a Protective Service Worker. That's definitely something we can explore. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a bit more about why you’ve found them difficult to tolerate?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to explain, truthfully. It’s not a matter of discomfort, precisely. More that I feel… disconnected. A bit suffocated, even though the mask itself isn’t tight. I work with people in vulnerable situations, and being able to see their faces, to read their expressions, is very important to my job. It helps me build trust, and assess how they’re really doing. With the mask on, I feel like… a barrier is up. And it affects my ability to do my work effectively. It’s something I noticed right away when the new rule came down. I’ve been trying to adapt, but it’s proving… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. That makes a lot of sense, especially given the nature of your work. Building trust and accurately assessing someone’s emotional state is crucial, and being able to see facial expressions is a big part of that. It’s not just about physical comfort, but about your ability to do your job well. So, to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any physical symptoms while wearing a mask – things like shortness of breath, dizziness, or headaches?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. No, not exactly. I haven’t experienced any… dramatic physical symptoms. A little warmer, perhaps, and my glasses fog up, which is… inconvenient. But it's not like I’m struggling to breathe, or getting lightheaded. It’s more of a… feeling. An anxiety, almost, about not being able to connect properly. It's unsettling, and it makes me… less effective at my job. It's hard to explain – it's a very subtle thing, but it's there. I can wear the mask, technically. It's just… not ideal. It affects my work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the primary issue is the psychological impact – the feeling of disconnection and the impact on your ability to build rapport and assess situations accurately, rather than a physical inability to wear the mask. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed if this feeling is worse in certain situations – for example, when working with children, or with individuals who are particularly traumatized?
PATIENT: Yes, you are very perceptive, Doctor. It is worse with children, definitely. They rely so much on nonverbal cues, and I rely on reading theirs. It feels… wrong, almost, to have that obscured. And with individuals who have experienced trauma… well, trust is already fragile. The mask adds another layer of… distance. It makes it harder to establish a connection, and that can be detrimental. It's not that I can't try to connect, it's that it's significantly more difficult. It requires a lot more effort, and it’s exhausting. And I worry it impacts their sense of safety, even subconsciously. It’s something I’ve noticed repeatedly over the past few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s very insightful, and it paints a clearer picture of the challenges you're facing. It sounds like the mask is actively hindering your ability to perform your job effectively, specifically due to the nature of the population you serve and the importance of nonverbal communication in those interactions. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally quite healthy. I’ve not had any major illnesses or surgeries. I do have… mild hypertension, managed with a small dose of medication. Otherwise, nothing significant. I’ve always been active, and I try to eat well. I haven't been hospitalized in… decades, truthfully. No history of anxiety or depression, though I've experienced grief, as many of us do. I have Medicare, and I see my primary care physician regularly for check-ups. He can verify this, if needed. I don’t have any allergies, and I haven’t had any… unusual reactions to medications in the past. I’m Lakota Sioux, and while we have some family history of diabetes, I’ve managed to avoid it so far. I try to stay healthy, both physically and mentally. It’s important for my work, and for myself.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. So, mild hypertension, well-controlled with medication, otherwise healthy. No history of anxiety or depression. That’s good to know. Let's talk about your current medications. What are you taking for your hypertension, and what's the dosage?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I take Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once daily. I've been on it for about five years now, and it's been very effective at managing my blood pressure. I have it right here, if you'd like to see the bottle. It’s prescribed by Dr. Ramirez, my primary care physician. He’s in Rapid City. I get a refill every three months, and I’ve had no side effects. My blood pressure is usually around 130/80, give or take a few points, when I check it at home. I try to monitor it regularly, as Dr. Ramirez recommends. It's not a large dosage, and I haven't had any issues with it. I make sure to take it every morning with breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily, well-controlled blood pressure, no side effects. That’s good. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’m quite comfortable with those procedures. I assure you, I’m generally in good health. But I appreciate your diligence. I'll just... sit here quietly while you perform the examination.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds good so far. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within a reasonable range, given you were just describing a stressful situation. Heart and lungs sound clear, and your oxygen saturation is excellent. I’m going to ask a few more clarifying questions, then we can discuss potential options for your mask exemption. Do you have any concerns about the physical act of wearing a mask, even a surgical mask, for extended periods, like during a workday?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. As I mentioned earlier, the physical discomfort is minimal. It's not the tightness, or the breathing, or anything like that. I can wear a mask all day if necessary. It’s the… psychological effect. The disconnection. It's difficult to explain. I feel like it's… hindering my ability to do my job effectively. It's like… a barrier between myself and the people I'm trying to help. I’m not physically unable to wear one, I just… feel it impacts my work too much. It feels wrong, and it makes it harder to build trust, which is… essential in my line of work. It's not about can I wear it, it’s about should I, given the nature of my responsibilities. I hope that clarifies my position.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies it perfectly. You’re able to physically tolerate a mask, but the feeling of disconnection it creates significantly impacts your ability to perform your job effectively, specifically due to the nature of your work with vulnerable populations. Given your description, and the lack of any underlying physical or psychological conditions that would preclude mask wearing, a full medical exemption may be difficult to obtain. However, we can explore a reasonable accommodation request. Have you discussed this with your employer?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. I spoke with my supervisor, Ms. Henderson, last week. She was… understanding, but she also explained that the new policy is mandated by the county. She suggested I speak with you to see if there was any medical basis for an exemption. She's willing to consider reasonable accommodations if possible. We discussed things like… increased distancing, or potentially working with clients in outdoor settings, when feasible. She also mentioned that she’s open to exploring other options, if you have any suggestions. She is a good supervisor, and she wants to support her team, but her hands are tied by the county regulations. She requested a formal statement from you, outlining my concerns and any potential recommendations you might have. That’s why I’m here today, hoping for your guidance.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know that your supervisor is willing to work with you. Given the circumstances, and based on my examination and our conversation, I can write a letter outlining your specific concerns – the psychological impact of mask wearing on your ability to build rapport with vulnerable clients, and the potential negative impact on your work. I can also recommend exploring reasonable accommodations, such as increased distancing, outdoor settings when feasible, and potentially utilizing clear face shields as an alternative, if appropriate and county regulations allow. A clear face shield might offer a compromise – it provides some physical protection, while still allowing you to see facial expressions and build trust. Would you be open to that as a potential option?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a clear face shield sounds like a very reasonable compromise. It would allow me to see facial expressions, which is so important for building trust and assessing a client’s emotional state, while still providing some degree of protection. I would be happy to explore that option. I haven’t considered that before, but it seems like a good solution. I would need to ensure it meets the county’s regulations, of course, but I believe that would be a viable alternative to a traditional mask. I’m very grateful for your guidance, and for your willingness to write a letter outlining my concerns. That would be a tremendous help. I would appreciate any advice you have regarding how to best present this request to Ms. Henderson and the county officials.
DOCTOR: Okay. I will draft a letter outlining your concerns, recommending the use of a clear face shield as a potential accommodation, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining rapport with vulnerable clients in your role as a Protective Service Worker. I'll also include a statement regarding your well-controlled hypertension and lack of any underlying conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, should that be necessary. As for presenting the request, I recommend focusing on the effectiveness of your work and the potential impact of mask wearing on your ability to serve your clients effectively. Highlight the importance of nonverbal communication in building trust, and explain how a clear face shield would allow you to continue providing high-quality care. You can also mention my recommendation as supporting evidence. Would you like me to send the letter directly to Ms. Henderson, or would you prefer a copy for yourself to deliver?
PATIENT: A copy for myself would be preferable, Doctor. I would like to review it before submitting it, and I feel more comfortable delivering it directly to Ms. Henderson. That way, I can explain the situation in person and answer any questions she might have. I appreciate you offering to send it directly, but I believe a personal touch would be more effective in this case. I’m happy to provide her contact information, if needed. I’m very grateful for your time and your assistance with this matter. You’ve been incredibly helpful, and I feel much more confident about presenting this request to my supervisor and the county officials. Is there anything else I need to do today?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will prepare a copy of the letter for you to review. I’ll have it ready for you by the end of the day. I’ll also include a brief summary of my findings from today’s examination, just for your records. No, there’s nothing else you need to do today. Just review the letter at your convenience, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you the best of luck with your request. I’m confident that your supervisor will consider your concerns and work with you to find a reasonable solution. If you experience any changes in your health or have any other medical concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Bacy. I appreciate your kindness and your thoroughness. I will certainly keep you informed of the outcome. You have a good day as well.
