DOCTOR: Bula! And hello, Chelise. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Kimm. It’s very nice to meet you too. Well, my regular check-up showed my cholesterol is a little high, the nurse said. Hyper… something. I don't remember the whole word, but she said I should talk to a doctor about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're getting it checked out. Hyperlipidemia – that’s the longer word the nurse likely mentioned. It just means you have higher than ideal cholesterol levels. We'll definitely take a closer look at that today. First, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, hyper…lipidemia. I’ll try to remember that. As for my health… well, I think I’m pretty good, for my age. I don’t get sick much. I walk every day, usually around the park near my apartment. And I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables. I’ve never really had any serious problems, honestly. Do you want to know about… family health, too? My mother had some trouble with her heart when she was older, but I don’t know all the details.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re active and prioritize a healthy lifestyle! That makes a big difference. And yes, family history is very helpful, so any details you can recall about your mother’s heart trouble would be great. Even just a general idea of what she experienced is a good start. While you think about that, let's quickly go through some basic questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, allergies… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Nothing I know of, anyway. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my grandmother in her garden, and she grew all sorts of things, and I never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I did have a bit of a rash once when I was a child, but my mother said it was just from poison ivy. Does that count? As for medications… I haven’t taken anything regularly in years, except for a vitamin D supplement in the winter. It gets pretty gray here!
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the vitamin D. And no known drug allergies, that’s helpful. The poison ivy rash doesn’t count as a true allergy. Now, let’s talk a little bit about any medications you do take, even occasionally. You mentioned the vitamin D. What dose do you take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, right, the vitamin D. It’s… let me see, I have the bottle here somewhere… …Ah, here it is! It’s 2000 IU, and I take one tablet every day during the winter months. So, from November to March, usually. It helps with my bones, the doctor told me years ago. I don't really pay attention to why, just that I should take it when it’s dark. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you. 2000 IU daily from November to March – good. Now, before we get to your mother's health, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual things, you know, colds and flu, a broken arm when I was a teenager – I was very clumsy! – but nothing serious. I’ve had regular check-ups with my family doctor for years, and he always said I was perfectly healthy. He retired a few years ago, that’s why I haven’t seen anyone regularly since then. I don't think he ever mentioned any problems. I always felt pretty good, so I didn’t really worry about it. Does that make sense? I’m not a very medical person.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, and it’s good you haven’t had any major health concerns. No previous diagnoses, that’s helpful to know. You mentioned your mother had some heart trouble. Do you recall what specifically she was diagnosed with, or any treatments she received?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my mother… it was a long time ago now. She had… something with her heart rhythm. It wasn’t regular, the doctors said. She got very tired easily, and she would sometimes feel dizzy. She ended up having a… a little device put in her chest to help her heart beat properly. A pacemaker, I think it was called. She had to go to the hospital for that, and then she went for check-ups every few months. She lived for quite a few years after that, but she wasn’t ever really the same. I remember she had to be careful about what she ate, and she couldn’t do too much strenuous activity. It was very sad. I was still quite young then, so I don’t remember all the details. Is that helpful? I feel bad I can’t be more specific.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A pacemaker for an irregular heart rhythm – that gives us some important information. It sounds like she had a condition called arrhythmia. Now, let's quickly cover your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother didn’t smoke either, and she always said it was very bad for your health. I always agreed with her. I don't even like the smell of it! I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Is that something you need to know? I’ve never been a big drinker.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Occasional wine is fine. Now, how about exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, I mentioned I walk every day! Usually around the park. It’s not a very strenuous walk, maybe an hour or so at a comfortable pace. I like to people-watch, too, so I often stop and chat with my neighbors. It's good for the soul, you know? I used to go swimming more when I was younger, but the pool closed a few years ago. Do you want to know how far I walk, exactly? I could try to estimate… it’s probably around two or three miles, I think.
DOCTOR: Two to three miles daily is excellent! That's very good for your heart health. Okay, and finally, just a quick question: Are you currently experiencing any stress or anxiety in your life?
PATIENT: Hmm, stress… well, life has its ups and downs, doesn’t it? I live alone since my husband passed away a few years ago, and sometimes I miss him very much. But I have good friends and family, and I keep busy. I volunteer at the local library, and that keeps my mind active. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly stressed, but… sometimes I feel a little lonely. It’s nothing major, though. Is that the kind of thing you mean? I try to stay positive, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very good that you have a good support system and stay active. It’s completely normal to feel lonely after a loss, and it's good you’re acknowledging that. Okay, that gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a quick look at your throat. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just sit up on the examination table and loosen your clothing, that would be perfect. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your lungs sound clear. Your heart sounds normal, but I do hear a very faint murmur. It’s quite subtle, so it’s not necessarily cause for alarm, but it’s something we should investigate further. Your throat looks clear as well. Now, given your cholesterol levels, your family history of arrhythmia, and the faint heart murmur, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, I’d like to do an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels in more detail, and a complete blood count just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A murmur… that doesn’t sound good, does it? But you said it's faint, so that’s good. And an EKG and blood tests… yes, that sounds sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust you. I just want to make sure everything is alright. Where will I have these tests done? And do I need to do anything to prepare for them? I don't want to mess anything up!
DOCTOR: You're right to ask questions, and it's good you're being proactive. The murmur is faint, and many murmurs are harmless. But it's always best to investigate. The tests will be done right here at the clinic. The nurse will draw your blood for the lipid panel and complete blood count. And she’ll attach some electrodes to your chest for the EKG – it's completely painless. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. For the EKG, try to avoid caffeine for a few hours before your appointment, just to keep your heart rate stable. The nurse will schedule those tests for you now. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good. Caffeine… I can definitely avoid caffeine. I usually just have one cup of tea in the morning, so that won't be a problem. And the nurse will schedule everything? That's very convenient. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I was quite worried about the cholesterol and the murmur, but you've explained everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chelise. It's my pleasure. I understand it can be worrying when you hear something unexpected, and I'm glad I could reassure you. We'll get those tests done, review the results, and come up with a plan together. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule your tests. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and I feel much better knowing what’s going on. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You’re a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very kind. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all before your next appointment. Take care, Chelise, and I'll see you soon.
