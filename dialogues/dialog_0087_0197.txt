DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need to get a card... a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or a taxi. I'm getting a little older and they want me to make sure I'm still okay to drive folks around. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sciarotta, that’s something we can certainly assist with. It sounds like you’re referring to a Commercial Driver Medical Certificate, or a CDMC. We perform the necessary examinations to determine eligibility. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, a CDMC, right. That's a mouthful. Okay, overall health… hmm. Well, I’m seventy, so things aren't perfect. I have a little arthritis in my knees, nothing too bad. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, that's why I wear these glasses. I had a divorce a few years back, which was stressful, but I'm doing alright now. Otherwise… I think I’m pretty good for my age. I try to stay active, you know? I like gardening. Do you need to know about any specific illnesses?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Arthritis and changes to your vision are good to know. And it's good you're staying active – that's important. Yes, if you could tell me about any specific illnesses you've been diagnosed with, or any hospital stays you’ve had, that would be very helpful. Also, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… let me think. I used to take something for high blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it a while ago. Said my numbers were good enough on their own. I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s about it, I think. No hospital stays in… oh, goodness, maybe twenty years? I broke my wrist when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Is that enough? I hope I’m not forgetting anything.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Ms. Sciarotta. Don't worry about forgetting things; it's perfectly normal. We can go through everything carefully. Just to confirm, you said you used to take medication for high blood pressure, but it was discontinued?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Discontinued. Dr. Yamamoto, he was a good doctor, he said my lifestyle changes were working well enough that I didn't need it anymore. I started walking more and watching what I eat. It was a long time ago though, maybe five or six years? I’m trying to remember exactly… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But he definitely said I could stop taking it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Sciarotta. It’s good that you were able to manage your blood pressure with lifestyle changes. And no worries about the timing, we can verify with Dr. Yamamoto’s office if needed. Now, could you tell me about any family history of significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or any neurological issues?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… that's a tough one. My mother, she had diabetes, but she lived a long life. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was fairly young. I don't really remember much about it. My brother is still alive, but I haven’t spoken to him in years. I don’t know what he’s got going on. Honestly, we weren’t a very close family. Is it important to know about my brother? I don’t want to bother him if it’s not necessary.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Sciarotta. Knowing about your mother’s diabetes and your father’s heart trouble is helpful. We don’t necessarily need information about your brother, especially if it would be difficult to obtain. Finally, could you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve had a few mosquito bites in my time, but that’s about it! I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. I'm glad I don't have any allergies, it makes life easier. Is that everything? Can we get to the actual exam now? I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Sciarotta. No allergies is great! Yes, let's move on to the physical exam. I just need to check your vision, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. We’ll also do a brief neurological assessment, just to make sure everything is functioning properly. First, let's check your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Vision it is. Let me adjust my glasses... okay. Um… is that an E? Yes, definitely an E. And then… F, P, T… oh, and L. Is that right? I’m not very good at this, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Sciarotta. It’s common for vision to change with age. You're doing great. Okay, let’s try this line now... can you read the first letter on this line for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That one’s… blurry. Really blurry. It looks a little like… a V? No, maybe a B? I’m really not sure. Honestly, Doctor, I think my glasses need updating. This is difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does appear your vision is quite diminished. It's possible your prescription has changed. We can certainly write a referral for you to see an optometrist for a full eye exam. For the purposes of this CDMC exam, we’ll need to document this finding. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. A new prescription is probably a good idea. Blood pressure… alright. Just let me know if it feels tight, okay? I don't like things feeling too constricted. And please, hurry if you can. I really need to get to my meeting.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated, Ms. Sciarotta. We'll need to monitor that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? Is that bad? I haven’t felt any chest pain or anything. My lifestyle changes should have helped with that, shouldn’t they? There. Is that alright? My breathing is usually pretty good. Just a little out of shape from gardening, maybe.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs. These crackles could be due to a number of things, Ms. Sciarotta, and aren't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but we should investigate further. Now, I’m going to do a brief neurological assessment. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Crackles, you say? Oh dear. More things to worry about. I suppose it’s better to know, though. Alright, neurological assessment it is. Follow your finger, you say? Just… don’t move it too fast, okay? My eyes aren’t what they used to be. And please, let’s hurry. My gardening club meeting starts in less than an hour.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: It’s a little hard to keep up, Doctor. But I’m trying. There. Is that tight enough? My arthritis is acting up today, so it’s not as strong as it normally is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sciarotta, that’s helpful. Based on my examination today, there are a few things we need to address before I can clear you for a Commercial Driver Medical Certificate. Your vision is significantly impaired, your blood pressure is elevated, and you have some weakness in your grip. I recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure and grip strength. I also strongly recommend a comprehensive eye exam with an optometrist. And, while not directly related to the CDMC, it might be useful to get your arthritis evaluated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So… I can’t get the card? Not yet? All this trouble… I just wanted to drive a few people around. Questions… hmm. Will I ever be able to get the card? Is this something serious? And… will driving be dangerous if I don’t get these things fixed? I don’t want to risk anyone’s safety. And… how long will this all take? I really need to know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, it's not that you can’t get the card, it’s just that we need to ensure you meet the necessary health requirements for safe driving. It's my responsibility to prioritize your safety and the safety of others. Regarding your concerns, the elevated blood pressure and weakened grip could potentially increase your risk while driving, but these are things we can address with proper medical management. As for the vision, that needs to be corrected for safe operation of a vehicle. To answer your questions directly: it’s difficult to say when you'll be able to get the card without knowing the results of the follow-up appointments. However, with appropriate treatment and correction, it's very possible. I recommend scheduling appointments with your primary care physician and an optometrist as soon as possible. Once you have those results, please bring them back to me, and we can re-evaluate your eligibility. I can provide referrals for both if you'd like. In the meantime, I strongly advise against driving until you've addressed these concerns. I understand this is frustrating, but your safety and the safety of others are paramount. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: Alright… referrals would be helpful, yes. Thank you. It’s just… driving is important to me. I like being independent. And I enjoy meeting new people. I suppose I have no choice, though. Safety first, as you say. Okay. Referrals, please. And… thank you for being honest with me. It's not what I wanted to hear, but I appreciate your candor. I think that’s all for now. I need to go make some phone calls.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. I’ll have my assistant prepare the referrals for your primary care physician and an optometrist. She'll also give you a summary of our discussion today, as well as the documentation of my exam findings. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns as you navigate these appointments. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again once you have the results. Have a good day, Ms. Sciarotta.
