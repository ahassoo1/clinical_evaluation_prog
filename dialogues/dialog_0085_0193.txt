DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Lahn. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, really. I am having a problem with… passing gas. A lot of gas. It’s… excessive, you understand? It makes me feel… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Mr. Goodstein. Digestive issues are very common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. “Excessive gas” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, it happens… pretty much all day. After I eat, certainly, but also… just randomly. It doesn’t always smell, but sometimes it does, and that is… not pleasant. It's been going on for… maybe three weeks now? I am not sure of the exact date, but around then. I haven’t changed what I eat, I don’t think. I eat the same things as always. Mostly… sandwiches, and soup. And sometimes a little bit of potato chips. Do you need to know what kind of sandwiches?
DOCTOR: No, not yet. Just knowing you haven’t noticed a significant change in your diet is helpful. Three weeks is a reasonable amount of time to be experiencing this. And it's good you're noticing the frequency and whether or not it’s associated with odor. To get a better picture, could you describe a typical day's meals for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… Usually, for breakfast, I have… toast. Just plain toast, with a little bit of butter. Sometimes, I have a banana. Then, for lunch, like I said, a sandwich. Ham and cheese, usually, on white bread. Or sometimes turkey. And then, for dinner… it varies. Sometimes soup – tomato soup is my favourite. Other times… leftovers from lunch, if there are any. Or another sandwich. I drink… water, mostly. And sometimes a little bit of apple juice. Is that… helpful? I’m trying to remember everything. I don’t eat anything fancy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you. It sounds like a pretty standard diet. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… Well, sometimes my stomach feels a little bit bloated, yes. Not always, but after I eat, sometimes it feels… full of air. And… occasionally, a little bit of cramping. Not very bad cramping, just… uncomfortable. It goes away pretty quickly, though. I haven’t had any… nausea, or vomiting, or anything like that. And I haven’t noticed any… change in my bowel habits. If that makes sense. I go to the bathroom… regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s all good information, Mr. Goodstein. “Bloating” and “occasional cramping” are important to note. And it’s good to know your bowel habits haven’t changed. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, not ever. I don’t really… go to the doctor very often. I’ve always been… pretty healthy, I think. Just a little bit of a cold now and then, but nothing serious. I’ve never had any… operations, or anything like that either. I take… nothing. No pills, no medicine, nothing at all. Except… sometimes a little bit of vitamin D in the winter, but that’s it. Medicare covers it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know. No prior medical conditions, no surgeries, and no regular medications – that’s helpful information. And the occasional vitamin D is fine. Now, let's talk a little about your family. Are there any digestive issues – like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, or celiac disease – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. Let me think. My mother… she sometimes had a little bit of heartburn, I think. But nothing serious. And my father… he had some stomach problems when he was older, but I don’t really know what. He didn't talk much about it. He… passed away a long time ago. I don't think anyone else in my family had anything… specific. My sister is very healthy, as far as I know. We don’t talk very often, though. So, I don't really know much about her medical history. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Goodstein. You've given me a good amount of information already. It sounds like there’s no strong family history of digestive issues. Just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. Never have. And I do not drink alcohol. It doesn’t agree with me. And I certainly do not use any… recreational drugs. I am a very… simple man. I don’t do any of that. I am trying to live a healthy life. I like my sandwiches, and my soup, and my water, and that is about it. I promise.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for being so honest. That gives me a good picture of your overall lifestyle. Alright, now I’d like to listen to your abdomen and do a quick abdominal exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I am a little bit nervous, but I want to figure out what is wrong. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down on the table, that would be wonderful. I’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then gently press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness. It might be a little uncomfortable if you are particularly sensitive, but I will be as gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here I go. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Goodstein. I’m listening now. Take some nice, deep breaths. I don’t hear anything particularly concerning – no unusual sounds. I am feeling some slight tenderness in your lower left abdomen, but it’s not severe. No guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen is soft. Okay, that's good information. It doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning. Now, sit up when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. So… what do you think is wrong? Is it serious? The tenderness… that doesn’t sound good. I am starting to feel a little bit worried. I thought it was just gas, but now… Is it something I ate? Or is it… something else? I appreciate you examining me so carefully. I just want to know what is going on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Goodstein. However, based on the exam, it doesn't seem like anything acutely serious. The tenderness I felt is mild, and there were no other concerning signs. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, the most likely explanation is excessive gas, possibly related to diet or how your digestive system is processing food. It could also be related to a slight imbalance in the gut microbiome. It's not uncommon, especially with changes in diet or stress levels. To rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I would like to order some simple blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. We can also check a stool sample for any signs of inflammation or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If that is what you think is best, then I agree. Blood tests and a stool sample… alright. Whatever you need. I just want to know what is going on and how to fix it. And if it is something related to my diet, then I can try to… eat differently. Maybe less sandwiches. Do I need to schedule another appointment for the results? And where do I… do the stool sample? I’ve never done that before. I hope it’s not… too difficult. I appreciate your patience with me, Doctor. I am not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Goodstein. It’s perfectly normal to be unsure about these things. Yes, we’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results – about a week from today should be good. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll handle the blood draw. As for the stool sample, they will give you a collection kit and detailed instructions. It’s not as difficult as it sounds – it's just a matter of collecting a small sample in a clean container. The lab technician can walk you through the process if you need help. I will print out the lab order and instructions for you now. Do you have any questions about the tests or the collection process?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. The instructions look… pretty clear. And I can ask the lab technician if I get confused. Thank you for explaining everything so carefully. It makes me feel… much better. So… a week from today. I’ll write that down. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid eating? Or any over-the-counter medications I can take to… relieve the gas? I just want to be prepared. And I’m very grateful for your help, Doctor Lahn. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. In the meantime, try to avoid foods that are known to cause gas, like beans, broccoli, cabbage, onions, and carbonated drinks. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can also help. Over-the-counter simethicone or activated charcoal may provide some temporary relief, but I wouldn’t recommend taking them long-term without discussing it with me first. Mostly, try not to stress too much. Stress can actually worsen digestive issues. And we’ll get to the bottom of this. Here are the lab orders. Please let the front desk know you need to schedule a follow-up appointment when you’re done at the lab. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. You have been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And I will try not to stress. Easier said than done, but I will try. I think… I am ready to go now. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day too, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
