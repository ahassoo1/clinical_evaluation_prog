DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s this pain, you see. Lower down… in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it is here, it’s quite… unpleasant. I believe that’s what prompted me to schedule this visit. It’s been… a while since I’ve felt anything quite like it. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do know it has something to do with… a condition I have. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I believe the name is?
DOCTOR: Right, thank you for sharing that, Alese. Lupus can certainly cause a variety of symptoms, and abdominal pain is one of them. It’s good you remembered that. Let's talk about this pain a bit more specifically. When did it first start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It feels like… a few months, perhaps? Though, it’s hard to be certain. Time seems to slip away these days. It wasn’t constant at first. Just… little twinges. But lately, it’s been more frequent… and stronger. I can’t pinpoint an exact date, I’m afraid. Is that… helpful? I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Alese, it's perfectly understandable. Many things can affect our memory, and it’s more important to get a general idea. So, a few months of intermittent pain, now becoming more frequent and stronger. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… It’s… a cramping sensation, mostly. Like a very tight squeezing. And sometimes… sharp. Not constantly sharp, but it comes in waves, you see? And it seems to radiate… towards my back a little. It's not… debilitating, not usually. But it’s certainly uncomfortable enough to disrupt things. I find myself needing to lie down sometimes. Does that… make sense? I hope I’m being clear.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Alese – cramping with sharp waves radiating to your back. And it's disrupting your daily activities. Okay. Now, does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmmm… Warm baths seem to help a little. Just… soothing it, you know? And lying down, as I mentioned. But honestly… I haven’t noticed anything that reliably makes it worse. Sometimes it just… comes on. Though, I think… perhaps if I’m overly stressed it flares up? But I’ve been rather… calm lately, so I’m not entirely sure. It’s all a bit… hazy, really. I do try to eat regular meals, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, warmth and lying down provide some relief, potentially stress as a factor, and you maintain a regular diet. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Well… I’ve been rather tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes a little breathless. But I chalked that up to my age, mostly. And… occasionally, a bit of a rash. Not a large one, just… small patches. Mostly on my arms, I believe. And… oh! My joints have been a little achy. But again, that’s not uncommon for me. I have… had issues with my joints for quite some time. Is any of that… relevant, Doctor? I’m afraid I’m not very good at listing things out.
DOCTOR: Yes, Alese, all of that is relevant. Fatigue, breathlessness, a rash, and joint aches, especially in the context of a Lupus diagnosis, are things we need to consider. Just to clarify the rash – can you describe what it looks like?
PATIENT: It’s… not raised, thankfully. More… flat, reddish patches. Small, really. No bigger than a coin, perhaps. And they come and go, much like the pain. Mostly on the backs of my hands and forearms, as I said. And… sometimes a little on my cheeks. But it’s not a full-blown… butterfly rash, if that makes sense. Just… small patches. It doesn’t itch, usually. Though, sometimes it feels a little… warm to the touch. I haven't taken a picture, I'm afraid. Would that have been helpful? I should perhaps start doing that… to aid my memory, and yours, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea to start documenting things, Alese. Flat, reddish patches on your hands and forearms, sometimes on your cheeks, no itching. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history a bit more broadly. You mentioned Lupus – do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I have… had high blood pressure for some time. I take medication for that, regularly. And… arthritis, as I mentioned with the joints. That’s not a surprise, I suppose. And… oh! I had a bout of pneumonia a few years ago. That was rather unpleasant. But I’ve recovered fully, thankfully. And… I believe that’s all. I think. My memory is so frustrating sometimes. Do you have a record of my medications, Doctor? I worry I’m forgetting something important. I do see a rheumatologist regularly for the Lupus, of course.
DOCTOR: Yes, Alese, I'm seeing your history of hypertension, arthritis, and a past episode of pneumonia. And it's good you see a rheumatologist for your Lupus – that’s very important. I do see a list of your medications here… Lisinopril for the blood pressure, and a few others. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness you have a list. My memory is just… No, no supplements or herbal remedies, Doctor. Just the Lisinopril, and… Let me see… there's also… Meloxicam, for the arthritis. And… occasionally, I take a pain reliever. Just over-the-counter, something simple like ibuprofen when the arthritis flares up particularly badly. But that’s it, I assure you. Nothing else. I try to be careful about mixing things, you see. And I always tell my rheumatologist everything I’m taking, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril and Meloxicam regularly, and ibuprofen as needed. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I am allergic to penicillin. Quite severely, actually. I had a… rather unpleasant reaction to it when I was younger. And… I believe that's it, Doctor. No food allergies, thankfully. Just the penicillin. It’s been… many years since that happened, but I always make sure to tell doctors, of course. It’s not something I want to experience again.
DOCTOR: Okay, a penicillin allergy. That’s important to know, thank you. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I believe in living a healthy lifestyle, as much as my… condition allows. I find that regular, gentle exercise helps, and a good diet, of course. And… keeping my mind active. Though, that’s becoming more challenging these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, non-smoker, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… complicated. My mother had… arthritis, quite badly. And… My grandmother… on my father’s side, she had… something autoimmune, I believe. I don’t recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. And… I believe my uncle had… heart problems. But beyond that… I don’t really know much. My family wasn’t… very good at keeping track of things, you see. It’s rather frustrating, actually, when it comes to medical history. I apologize for my vagueness. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of arthritis and something autoimmune in the family, and heart problems. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s go back to your current symptoms. To summarize, you’ve been experiencing intermittent abdominal pain for a few months, now becoming more frequent and stronger. It’s cramping with sharp waves radiating to your back, relieved somewhat by warmth and lying down. You’ve also noticed fatigue, breathlessness, a rash on your hands and forearms, and joint aches. You have a history of Lupus, hypertension, and arthritis, and you’re currently taking Lisinopril and Meloxicam, with occasional ibuprofen as needed. You’re allergic to penicillin. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your joints. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I understand the need for a physical exam. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to remain still and answer any questions you may have. It's… a bit disconcerting to think about what might be causing all of this, but I trust your expertise. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just… be gentle, if you would. My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Alese, I'm listening to your heart now. Everything sounds regular, no murmurs or unusual sounds. Taking a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult, to be honest. My lungs haven't been the same since the pneumonia. But I’ll do my best. Is everything alright? Do you hear anything unusual? I apologize if I'm making this difficult. I do try to take care of myself, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, Alese. A little reduced breath sound on both sides, which is consistent with some mild scarring from the pneumonia, but nothing concerning at this moment. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay… and how about here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes… that’s… tender. Not excruciating, but definitely… uncomfortable. It’s… a sharp pain, really. And… it seems to radiate a little towards my back, as I mentioned earlier. Does that… tell you anything, Doctor? I do try to be stoic, but it’s hard to hide the discomfort, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting some tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. And yes, you’re right, it does seem to radiate to your back. Now, I’m going to check your joints. I'm going to gently move your arms and legs and see if you feel any pain or stiffness. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, but definitely… stiffness and ache. My wrists have been particularly troublesome lately. And my knees… they seem to swell up after I’ve been on my feet for too long. It’s… a familiar sensation, unfortunately. I’ve had arthritis for years, as I mentioned. It’s just… seems to be worse lately. Do you… detect any swelling, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Alese, I'm detecting some mild swelling and tenderness in both wrists and knees. The range of motion is slightly limited as well. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are normal. Alright, Alese. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam and your history, we have tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side, some swelling and stiffness in your wrists and knees, and a history of Lupus and arthritis. Given your history of Lupus, abdominal pain could be related to several things, including inflammation of the lining of the abdomen , inflammation of the intestines , or even a flare-up of your Lupus affecting other organs. However, other causes also need to be considered, such as diverticulitis or even a urinary tract infection. To help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker called CRP, and a urine analysis. I also think it would be beneficial to get an abdominal CT scan to visualize your organs and rule out any structural abnormalities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your careful consideration. Blood work and a CT scan… yes, that seems prudent. I trust your judgment. I understand the need to rule out various possibilities, especially given my Lupus. I’m… somewhat apprehensive about the CT scan, to be honest. But if it’s necessary, then I’ll gladly comply. Will the CT scan require any… contrast dye? And are there any preparations I need to make before the blood work? I want to be as cooperative as possible, you see. I just want to get to the bottom of all this, and hopefully find some relief.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, the CT scan will likely require contrast dye to get a clearer image. We’ll need to check your kidney function first to make sure it’s safe to administer the dye. As for the blood work, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except for water. We’ll give you a lab order and instructions when you leave. While we await the results, I want to emphasize that these tests are just to help us determine the cause of your pain. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s something serious wrong. Given your current symptoms and your Lupus history, I'm also going to prescribe a low dose of prednisone, a steroid medication, to help reduce the inflammation and provide some symptom relief. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Prednisone… yes, I’ve taken that before, during previous Lupus flares. It… helped, but I do worry about the side effects, of course. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. I understand the need to manage the inflammation. And you’ll be monitoring me closely for any side effects, I presume? And will the prednisone interact with any of my other medications? I just want to be sure, you know. I just want to feel better, and I appreciate your careful approach.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll monitor you closely for any potential side effects of the prednisone, such as increased blood sugar, elevated blood pressure, mood changes, and fluid retention. We will check your blood pressure and blood sugar regularly. Prednisone can interact with some medications, but it doesn’t typically interact with Lisinopril or Meloxicam. However, it’s always best to be cautious, so we’ll review your medication list again to make sure everything is safe. I’m going to write you a prescription for prednisone, and I’ll also give you some instructions on how to take it and what side effects to watch out for. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review your blood work results, CT scan results, and your response to the prednisone. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and informative. I appreciate your careful consideration of my Lupus and my other medical conditions. Perhaps… just one question. What if the CT scan does show something concerning? What would be the next steps then? I know it’s a bit morbid to ask, but I prefer to be prepared, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Alese, and it’s good you’re thinking ahead. If the CT scan shows something concerning, the next steps would depend on the specific finding. For example, if it shows diverticulitis, we might start you on antibiotics. If it shows something more serious, like a tumor, we would likely refer you to a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or oncologist, for further evaluation and treatment. We would discuss all of your options with you in detail and help you make the best decision for your health. It’s important to remember that a concerning finding on a CT scan doesn’t necessarily mean the worst. It just means we need to investigate further to determine the cause and best course of action. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and seeing what the results show. I’m confident that we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Here are the prescriptions and lab orders. The nurse will review the instructions with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I feel much more hopeful now. I’ll be sure to follow the instructions carefully and call the office if I have any concerns. Thank you, Doctor Auelua. I appreciate your kindness and expertise. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Alese. You take care now, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I wish you a good day as well.
