DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I read your… credentials. You seemed competent enough, which is rare these days. I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. I don’t want any complications. Is that so much to ask? I’m… not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Shteynberg, I appreciate your… directness. And, no, it isn't too much to ask to want a straightforward pregnancy. However, as you likely understand, even in the most optimal circumstances, biology isn't always… cooperative. Let's start with some details, shall we?
PATIENT: Details. Of course. Always details. Fine. Ask away. But I assure you, my health is excellent. I cycle regularly, I eat… reasonably well, and I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My ex-husband, now there was a man with questionable habits. But that's neither here nor there. I just want to know what steps I need to take to make this happen, quickly.
DOCTOR: Cycling regularly is a good start. "Reasonably well" is… vague, but we'll circle back to that. And thank you for the… personal anecdote. Now, let’s be a little more specific. Could you tell me how regular is “regular”?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Every twenty-eight days, like clockwork. Always has been. I keep meticulous records. Honestly, it’s astounding how unreliable women are these days. They don't manage things properly. But me? I’m… organized. You can ask anyone. And it's not an estimate, Doctor. Twenty-eight days. Precisely.
DOCTOR: Twenty-eight-day cycles… noted. And you’ve been tracking this for… how long?
PATIENT: Since I started menstruating, naturally. Do you need me to calculate the exact number of years? Because I can, but I find the question rather… insulting. It's been a lifetime. A very long lifetime, filled with… disappointments. But we're not here to discuss my personal life, are we? Just the facts, Doctor. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Have you been trying to conceive for a specific period of time?
PATIENT: Trying? Not exactly. I just… assumed it would happen. I mean, I’m a healthy woman! And it hasn’t. That’s why I’m here, wasting my valuable time. It's been… a few months. Not terribly long, but I’m not foolish. I understand the… biological clock. And frankly, I don’t want to be waiting years.
DOCTOR: A few months of actively trying. Alright. And is your partner… involved in this process?
PATIENT: Partner? Doctor, are you implying something? I’m divorced. Have been for… well, it doesn’t matter how long. I am pursuing this on my own. A perfectly viable option, might I add. These days, everything is possible with… science. But I'd like to get on with it, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shteynberg. My apologies. I simply needed to clarify. Single parenthood is certainly an option, and a perfectly valid one. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Honestly, the questions! Very well. I had a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis when I was thirty, and my wisdom teeth were removed, rather traumatically, at twenty-two. Otherwise? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I’m remarkably robust. I take vitamins. And I walk. A great deal. Do you really need a complete listing of every sniffle I’ve ever endured?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shteynberg, a complete listing isn't necessary. Just ensuring there are no underlying issues. Any surgeries beyond the wisdom teeth removal?
PATIENT: No. None. Absolutely not. I've always taken excellent care of myself. I've never indulged in risky behaviours. Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my lifestyle? I assure you, it’s… impeccable. Perhaps if more people adopted my habits, there wouldn’t be so many… complications.
DOCTOR: I am simply gathering information, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s standard procedure. Now, let's discuss any medications you currently take, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. You mentioned vitamins, could you be specific about those?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. A multivitamin, naturally. Vitamin D, it’s dreadfully lacking these days. And… a calcium supplement. I’m quite particular about my bone density. And sometimes, if I feel a cold coming on, I’ll take zinc. Is that sufficient detail for your… records? I assure you, nothing remotely… recreational.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, Vitamin D, calcium, and zinc as needed. Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I’m Hungarian! We practically invented resilience. No, I have no allergies. None whatsoever. I eat everything. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything in my life. Honestly, I’m starting to wonder what the point of this entire exercise is.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, infertility issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… a tragic mess, honestly. My mother had… nerves. My aunt had a terrible bunion. And my grandfather… well, let's just say he wasn't particularly careful with spicy food. Nothing remotely relevant to… conception, I assure you. They were… complicated people. It’s best not to dwell. I'm the healthy one, the successful one.
DOCTOR: History of nerves, bunion, and spicy food intolerance in family. Alright. Now, Ms. Shteynberg, I would like to perform a physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a pelvic exam. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Doctor, are you serious? I've already told you, I'm perfectly healthy. I don’t require… poking and prodding. Honestly, it's rather insulting to suggest that. I came here for a solution, not an… investigation. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time. Unless you have something concrete to offer me, I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, a physical exam is a standard part of evaluating fertility. It allows me to assess your overall health and identify any potential issues that may be affecting your ability to conceive. While you may feel healthy, there may be underlying factors we wouldn't otherwise be aware of. I understand your discomfort, but it is necessary. Without it, I cannot provide a proper assessment. We can discuss your concerns and I will ensure your comfort. However, I cannot proceed without a basic evaluation. Do you wish to reschedule for a time when you are more comfortable with proceeding with a complete workup, including a physical exam?
PATIENT: Reschedule? Doctor, you are remarkably… persistent. And frankly, rather condescending. I came to you expecting expertise, not a lecture and an… invasion. I will find another doctor. One who respects my time and my… obviously perfect health. You are wasting mine. .
DOCTOR: Patient declined physical exam and further evaluation. Expressed dissatisfaction with standard procedures and concerns about time. Recommend patient seek alternative care if further investigation is desired.
