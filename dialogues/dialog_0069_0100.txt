DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, was it? Hmm… what brought me in… right. Well, it’s this… test. For, uh… substances. Yes, that’s it. A substance test. Someone said I needed one. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare wanted it, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, a substance test. That’s perfectly alright, it can be a bit confusing navigating those requests. And you said Medicare was involved, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A lot of paperwork… and calls. My late husband, bless him, always handled all that. Now… it just sort of gets done. I get letters, fill out things… and then people ask me to come places. It’s all very… roundabout. I don’t really remember being told specifically why they want the test, just that I needed to come. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, Ms. Hughston, especially with recent changes. It's not uncommon for these requests to come with a lot of paperwork and not a clear explanation. To help me understand, do you know if this test is related to a specific doctor’s visit or a new medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A new medication… let me think. I take something for my arthritis, has for years now. And a little something for my blood pressure. But nothing new, not recently. A doctor's visit… I see Doctor Lewis sometimes, for my knees. But… no, I don’t think it was because of him. Honestly, Doctor, it's all a bit of a blur. My memory isn't what it used to be. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, please don't apologize at all, Ms. Hughston. Memory issues are very common, and it's perfectly fine to take your time. Let’s try a different approach then. Do you have a list of your current medications with you, or do you remember what you take for your arthritis and blood pressure?
PATIENT: I do have this, yes. See? Little colorful pills. Um… the blue ones are for my knees, I think. Doctor Lewis gave them to me. And the white ones… oh dear. I should know this. They're for my… pressure. Yes, blood pressure. I take one in the morning. Sometimes two, if I'm feeling a bit… fluttery. But I couldn’t tell you what they’re called, exactly. Sorry again. It’s awful not to remember these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. We can figure it out. Do you happen to know the dosages of either medication?
PATIENT: Dosages… now that’s a tricky one. I just… take them. Like the blue ones, for my knees… I think it’s just one a day. Maybe two if it's a bad day. And the white ones… I usually take one. But sometimes I look at the bottle and it says… hmm. Something like… 20? 20 milligrams? Is that right? I’m not good with numbers, Doctor. It all looks the same after a while. I mostly just try to remember to take them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, one or two of the blue pills for your knees as needed, and one or two of the white pills, potentially 20 milligrams, for your blood pressure. To clarify, when you say "fluttery," can you describe what you feel when you take two of the white pills?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, fluttery. It's… like a little bird flapping in my chest, maybe? A quick, unsteady beat. Not painful, just… unsettling. Like my heart is trying to escape. It happens sometimes when I’ve been on my feet a lot, or if it's very hot. That's when I take an extra pill. It usually helps calm it down. I try not to worry about it too much. It's just… a little bit of a scare. But, really, I don't know much about it. Doctor Lewis just told me to take another one if I felt that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like you’re experiencing some palpitations, a quick or irregular heartbeat, which you manage by taking an extra dose of your blood pressure medication. Now, going back to the substance test request… do you recall if anyone specifically mentioned what they were testing for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I really don't. There were words… something about making sure I was safe? And… and something about my driving, maybe? I do a bit of driving, to get to the shops, to see my friend Agnes. But I don’t remember anyone saying what substances they were looking for. Just that it was… routine? Or important? It all feels very hazy, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s frustrating not to remember these things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Hughston, you’re being very helpful. It sounds like this test may be related to your driving, potentially as part of a routine check or to ensure safety. Since you are unsure of the specifics, I would like to take a look at your Electronic Health Record to see if there's any documentation about the request. Just one moment while I pull up your file… Okay, here we are. It appears Medicare requested a urine drug screen as part of a comprehensive wellness review, and it is linked to maintaining your driver’s license. It’s a fairly standard procedure for people over a certain age. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history to get a better overall picture?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes… a little more sense. My driving, yes. I do enjoy my independence, you see. A comprehensive review… well, that sounds sensible. Questions about my history? Yes, yes, that’s fine. I'll try my best to answer them. Although, I warn you, my memory is… unreliable, as you know. But go ahead, Doctor. I'm here, and I'm happy to cooperate. Just don't ask me anything too complicated!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. We’ll take it slow. Let’s start with past medical conditions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions other than arthritis and high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other conditions… well, I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, many years ago. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. And… and I had a bit of a problem with my back a few years back, but that cleared up with physiotherapy. Other than that… I think that's it. Nothing major, I hope. I always try to stay healthy, you see. Lots of fresh air and… and trying to avoid stress. Although, these tests aren’t helping with the stress, are they?
DOCTOR: No, I understand they can be stressful. Thank you for sharing that. Pneumonia, gallbladder removal, and back problems. Good to know. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than those issues?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me see. No, I don't think so. Not that I can recall, anyway. The gallbladder came out as a day procedure, so that wasn't a hospital stay. And the pneumonia was when I was very young, I barely remember it. I had a lovely doctor then, very kind man, but it was a long time ago. No, I haven't been in hospital for anything else. Not recently, at least. I try to avoid hospitals if I can. All those germs, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, moving on to medications. You mentioned taking something for arthritis and blood pressure, and you've told me the pill colors. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Vitamins… yes! I take a multivitamin, a little one every morning. And sometimes, when I’m feeling a bit run down, I take vitamin C. For the immune system, you see. And… and I used to take something for my cholesterol, but Doctor Lewis took me off it a few years ago. He said my numbers were looking good. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, if I can avoid it. It all feels a bit… overwhelming, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, a multivitamin, vitamin C occasionally, and you used to take something for cholesterol but are no longer on it. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me think. No, I don't think so. Nothing serious, anyway. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes with pollen, but that's not a proper allergy, is it? And I used to get a rash with certain soaps, but I just stopped using them. No, I haven't had any serious allergic reactions. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, at least. I’m quite lucky, really. I seem to be able to eat and take most things without any problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother lived to a good age, I think she was in her eighties. She had a bit of trouble with her heart towards the end. And my father… he died when I was quite young, of a stroke, I think. My brother… he had high blood pressure, like me, and he had to watch his diet. Other than that… I don’t know much about my family history. My parents didn’t really talk about it much, and I never really asked. It wasn’t something we did, you see. Just kept things quiet, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. So, your mother had heart trouble, your father died of a stroke, and your brother had high blood pressure. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. Horrible habit, you know. My husband used to smoke, but he gave it up years ago. Said it wasn't doing him any good. No, I don’t smoke. And I don’t use any tobacco products. Never have. I like fresh air too much.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one, a white wine, usually. It helps me relax. But nothing heavy, you know. I don't drink every day. Maybe two or three times a week, if that. It's just a little treat, you see. Nothing excessive. I don’t have a big appetite for alcohol. It makes me feel a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, can you tell me a bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, my activity level… well, I try to stay active, you see. I walk to the shops when I can, it’s a good walk. And I do a bit of gardening, it keeps me busy. I used to do more, when my knees were better. I used to go swimming, but that’s been a while. Now, I mostly just potter around the house and garden. It’s not very strenuous, but it keeps me moving. I try to avoid sitting down for too long, you know. It’s important to keep the circulation going.
DOCTOR: Okay, walking, gardening, and trying to stay active. That gives me a good picture. Ms. Hughston, thank you for answering all those questions. I know it was a lot, and you said your memory isn’t always reliable. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the information in your chart, it seems appropriate to proceed with the urine drug screen. Do you have any questions about the test itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’ve asked a lot, haven’t you? And I’ve probably rambled on a bit! No, I don’t think I have any questions about the test. Just… what happens now? Do I need to do anything special? And how long will it take? I have an appointment with Agnes for tea at three, and I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: No, you haven't rambled at all, Ms. Hughston. And you're not late yet, it's just past one. The test itself is very simple. You’ll simply provide a urine sample in the restroom just down the hall. It should only take a few minutes. Once the sample is collected, it will be sent to the lab, and the results usually come back within a few days. We will contact you to discuss them. Do you need any assistance getting to the restroom?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds simple enough. No, thank you, I can manage. I’ve used a restroom before! Just… a few minutes, you said? I do hope it doesn’t take too long. Agnes makes a lovely lemon cake, and I wouldn't want to miss it. Alright, then. Here goes… Thank you, Doctor Andraca, for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. Take your time. I’ll be here when you get back. And enjoy your lemon cake!
