DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. Been going on for a couple weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad. Not a sharp itch, more… persistent. Like a really annoying feeling you can’t quite scratch away.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. Itching all over, for about two weeks. And you describe it as persistent, not a sharp itch...more of an annoyance. Alright. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… not really. I mean, life’s been pretty routine, you know? I lost my wife, bless her, about a year ago, so things are… quieter now. I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, no new laundry stuff. I haven't been anywhere different, no vacations or anything. I eat the same things, mostly. Oh! Wait... there was that new brand of tea I tried a few weeks back. Some herbal blend, supposed to be good for sleep. I stopped drinking it a couple days ago, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good catch. You tried a new herbal tea a few weeks ago, stopped a couple of days ago. We'll definitely keep that in mind. And this itching... is it worse at any particular time of day, or after doing anything specific?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky one. I don’t think it’s worse at a certain time, no. It seems… constant. But, now that I think about it, it’s definitely worse after I shower. The warm water… it just feels… more intense afterwards. And I use pretty mild soap, really. Nothing fancy. I always have, even before this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching is constant, but exacerbated after showering, even with mild soap. Alright. And has anything else changed with your skin?
PATIENT: Hmm… no rashes, no bumps, no blisters. Just… itchy skin. It doesn’t look different, honestly. Maybe… a little dry? But I live in a dry climate, and I always have to moisturize. It’s hard to tell if that’s new or just… normal for me. I've been putting lotion on it regularly, like always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no visible rash, bumps, or blisters. Possibly some dryness, but you regularly moisturize. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had high blood pressure for a bit, but that’s been under control with medication for years. Other than that… nothing major. I'm on Medicare, so they do regular check-ups, you know? They haven't found anything… concerning. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that’s ancient history.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and had your appendix removed as a child. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. I get the refill automatically from the pharmacy, so I don’t always remember the exact dosage, but I'm pretty sure it's ten. I’ve been on it for… oh, must be five or six years now. And I take it every morning, same time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, no trouble with shellfish or nuts or anything like that. I’ve even had a flu shot every year, no problems. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any skin conditions or allergies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had eczema when she was a child, but she outgrew it. And my grandmother… she had something, a sensitivity to the sun, I think. Always wore a hat and long sleeves. Nothing else really. My father was pretty healthy, actually. Long lived, strong man. No history of major allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, eczema in your mother as a child, and sun sensitivity in your grandmother. And finally, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped after my wife passed. Didn't seem right, you know? And no, definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Alright, Brendan. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Great. If you'll just sit up on the table for me. I'm going to take a look at your skin all over, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or hives. The skin looks…relatively normal in terms of color and texture. A little dry, as you mentioned. No visible lesions here either. Skin is a bit flaky on your upper back, but that's common with dryness. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80 today. Everything seems to be within normal limits on the physical exam, which is good. Given your history, the timing of the itching, and the fact that it's worsened after showering, I suspect this might be a case of dry skin, possibly exacerbated by something in the water or a mild irritant in your soap, despite it being a mild formula. Sometimes even the slightest change can cause a reaction.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I do live in a dry place. And it is getting worse after the shower. What do you recommend? Should I try a different soap altogether? Or maybe some sort of lotion? I've been using the same one for years, a basic unscented one.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's try a few things. I'm going to recommend switching to a fragrance-free, dye-free cleanser specifically designed for sensitive skin. Something like Cetaphil or Cerave. And continue using an unscented lotion immediately after showering while your skin is still damp. That helps lock in the moisture. Also, avoid very hot water. Lukewarm is best. And pat your skin dry instead of rubbing. We could also consider a short course of a topical steroid cream, like hydrocortisone 1%, to help calm the inflammation, but I’d like to try the more conservative measures first. If that doesn't improve your symptoms within a week or two, we can revisit that option.
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I can definitely switch soaps and be more careful with the water temperature. And I’ll remember to pat, not rub. I'll give that a try for a week or two and see if it helps. If it doesn’t get better, what would I do about the cream? Do I need an appointment, or can I call the office?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad that sounds manageable. If the itching doesn’t improve after two weeks of consistent use of the new cleanser and careful moisturizing, please call the office. We can schedule a follow-up appointment, and I can prescribe a mild topical steroid cream to try. We'll start with a small amount, just to see if it helps alleviate the itching. However, if you develop a rash, blisters, or if the itching becomes unbearable, please call us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I feel much better knowing what to try. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. Here’s a printout with the recommendations we discussed—the cleanser types, moisturizing instructions, and when to follow up. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. You too. .
