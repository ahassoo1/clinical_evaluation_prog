DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Laury, please. I want to… find out more about where my family come from. My people, you know? I hear now you can do test with… with spit, to see old history? I want to try that.
DOCTOR: Spit test… right. You’re referring to genetic ancestry testing, I believe. It's becoming more popular. It can provide some information about your ancestral origins, yes. Though, it's important to understand it isn't a perfect science, and it doesn't give a complete picture. Before we discuss that further, could you tell me a little more about why now?
PATIENT: Why now…? Well, I’m old, Doctor. Eighty-five! And I think a lot about the past now. My parents… they never talk much about before they come to the islands. Just say hard times. I want to know… where from hard times? My kids, they ask too. They want to know about great-grandparents, and I… I don't have much to tell them. It would be good to have something real. Something… not just stories.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's natural to want to connect with your roots, especially as you reflect on life. And it's wonderful that your children are interested. Okay. So, you're primarily interested in tracing your ancestry through genetic testing. Before we order anything, let's go over a little bit of your medical history, just to make sure everything's okay. It doesn't usually affect these tests, but it’s standard procedure. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not really. I get itchy sometimes from mosquito bites, but everyone does, right? And I… I can't eat too much sugar now, makes my tummy hurt. But that's not an allergy, is it? Doctor, I don't take much medicine. Just what the nurse gives me for my bones, you know, to keep them strong. Does that… does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful. Mosquito bites aren’t a medical allergy, and avoiding sugar due to stomach upset is good to know. And the medication for your bones… yes, that matters. Could you tell me the name of that medication, if you remember it?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a hard one. The little white pill? No… the nurse, she always bring it. She say it’s for… for the bending. You know, to stop the bending. I don't… I don't remember the name. It starts with a… with an 'A', maybe? Or a 'B'? I'm sorry, Doctor. Old brain doesn't work so good anymore. Maybe you can look it up in the computer? From my… Medicare?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. We can certainly look it up. That’s what the electronic health record is for. Let me just pull up your information… Ah, here we are. It appears you’re taking Alendronate. That’s a medication for osteoporosis, which is what causes the bending you mentioned. Good. Now, have you had any serious illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Serious…? Hmm… When I was a young man, I got very sick with the fever. The bad fever, everyone got. But I… I got better. And once, I broke my arm when I was climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. And… and nothing else, I think. Just the usual colds and… and aches. Old age aches, you know. I don’t think I ever had… surgery. Never had to cut me open, thank goodness. Does that… does that help? It's hard to remember so far back.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. The fever… was that dengue fever, do you recall?
PATIENT: Dengue…? I don't know that name. Just… the bad fever. Everyone on the island got it. We all sick, very weak. But we all got better. Old woman, she give us tea, made from leaves. That help, I think. It's… it's a long time ago, Doctor. I was just a boy. I don't remember much about what kind of fever it was. Just that it was bad. And we all sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll just note "unspecified fever as a child." And no surgeries. Do you have any family history of serious illnesses - heart problems, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… My mother, she got very tired at the end. Doctor, she just… stopped. My father, he was strong until the day he died. But he… he had trouble breathing. Like… like the water in his lungs. But I don't know what that was. And my sister… she had many babies, but she didn’t live very long. She got sick after one of them. That's… that's all I really know. Nobody talk much about sickness. Just… sad when someone gone. It’s hard to… to remember what made them sick. I don’t think they had doctors on the island back then. Just the old women with the tea.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mother with fatigue, father with breathing difficulties, sister with illness after childbirth. We'll note that as a family history of unspecified cardiac and respiratory issues, and potential postpartum complications. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never touched it. And no drink either. My parents, they say it’s bad for you. Makes you weak. And… and I never liked it. Too strong. Just… tea, that’s all I drink. And sometimes, a little bit of juice. But mostly tea. That’s all. I don’t need anything else. A simple life is good, Doctor. A simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker, no alcohol use. That’s excellent. Now, before we get to the ancestry testing, just one last thing. Are there any medications you are currently taking, besides the Alendronate, or any supplements, vitamins, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the bones pill, the Alendronate. And sometimes, the nurse she give me something for my tummy. When it’s really bad. It’s a… a pink liquid. But not all the time. Just when I eat too much sugar, maybe. And… and sometimes, I drink the tea. Like I told you, the old woman’s tea. It helps with everything. But it's not medicine, really. Just… tea. That’s all, Doctor. I think. I’m an old man, I forget things. But I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, Alendronate for osteoporosis, occasional pink liquid for stomach upset, and herbal tea. That gives me a good picture. Now, let's talk about this ancestry testing. It involves sending a saliva sample to a lab, and they analyze your DNA. It can tell you about your ethnic origins, and potentially connect you with relatives. However, it’s important to remember that it’s not always completely accurate, and the results are estimates. It doesn’t tell you everything about your family history, and it’s not a substitute for traditional genealogical research. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail and discuss the potential costs involved?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me more. I want to know how it work. And how much it cost. I don’t have much money, you know. But if it can tell me something about my people… something real… then maybe it’s worth it. Just tell me everything, Doctor. Everything you know. About the spit test. And the money.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. The test itself is quite simple. You’ll receive a kit in the mail. It includes a tube that you spit into, filling it to a certain line. Then you seal the tube and mail it back to the lab. The lab analyzes your DNA, which is in your saliva, and compares it to a database of genetic markers from people all over the world. The results come back in a few weeks, usually online. It will give you an estimated breakdown of your ethnic origins - for example, percentages of ancestry from different regions of Asia, the Pacific Islands, Europe, or Africa. It also might identify potential relatives who have also taken the test. Now, the cost varies depending on the company you choose. The most basic tests, which give you an ethnic origin breakdown, can cost around $100 to $200. More comprehensive tests, which include health reports and relative matching, can cost $300 or more. I can give you a list of reputable companies and their pricing. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. The results are estimates, not definitive answers. And the database is not complete, so it might not accurately represent all populations. Also, there's a small chance that the test could reveal unexpected information about your health or family history. Are you comfortable with those potential risks?
PATIENT: Unexpected information…? About health…? I don’t know… I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t need to know bad things about my health. I just want to know… where my people come from. If it can tell me that, and not tell me bad things… then maybe. But I don’t want surprises, you understand? I just want to know my history. Is there a test that just tells me history? Not about sickness, or family secrets? Just… where I come from? That's all I want, Doctor. Just my history.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Scobie. It's important to be fully informed. You're asking about a test that focuses specifically on ancestry, without delving into health risks or family history. Those are harder to find, as most companies offer comprehensive packages. However, there are a few companies that offer basic ancestry tests, focusing solely on ethnic origins. Let me see... 23andMe has an ancestry-only service, as does AncestryDNA. They both cost around $99. They won’t provide any health information, and the relative matching is optional. However, even with these tests, there is always a small risk of incidental findings. For example, the test might reveal that you carry a gene that is associated with a certain disease, even if you haven't specifically asked for health information. I can’t guarantee that you won’t encounter any unexpected information, but these tests are less likely to provide it. Before you decide, I want to be sure you understand the potential risks and benefits. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Incidental findings…? Too many big words, Doctor. I just… I just want to know about my people. If it shows me where they come from, and doesn’t tell me bad things… then maybe. But I don’t want to worry about things I can’t fix. I’m old, you know? I just want peace. And maybe… maybe to tell my kids something real. About where they come from. $99… that’s… that’s a lot of money for me. But… maybe. Can I think about it? And… can you write down the name of the company? And how to get the test? So I can ask my son about it. He's good with the computer.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. That’s a very sensible decision. Take your time and discuss it with your son. Here's the information: AncestryDNA: [Writes down the website address] Phone number: [Writes down the phone number] They have a good reputation, and they offer a basic ancestry test for $99. It focuses solely on ethnic origins, and you can opt-out of relative matching. They also have a customer support line you can call if you have any questions. I'll also write a brief note here in your chart about our conversation, and about your concerns regarding incidental findings. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you for explaining everything. You were very patient with me. I’ll talk to my son, and see what he thinks. And… thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure. Take your time, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. Have a good day, and I hope you and your son come to a decision that feels right for you. .
