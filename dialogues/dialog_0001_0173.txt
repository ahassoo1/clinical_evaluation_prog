DOCTOR: Alright, so… you’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Yeah, um, I’ve just been getting chills. Not like a fever chill, just… cold. It's been happening on and off for a few days now. It’s kinda annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Chills, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. And I feel a little tired, but I don’t know if that’s just… life, you know? I’ve been busy with work. It’s just… the chills are new.
DOCTOR: Busy with work. Right. Lots of people are "busy." When did these chills start, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was probably… Tuesday? Maybe Wednesday? I had a really long meeting on Tuesday, and I think I started feeling it that evening. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little shiver, but it’s been happening more since then. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tuesday… Wednesday. Okay. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… not really. No cough, no sore throat, no aches. Just… cold, and a bit tired. I haven’t taken my temperature or anything, I didn’t think it was that serious. Should I have? I mean, is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Should you have?
PATIENT: I don’t know! That’s why I’m here, right? I usually just try to push through things, but these chills are… persistent. And I don’t want to get anyone else sick if it is something. My mom's been a little under the weather lately, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's just do a quick listen to your lungs, okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Is that all you need to do? I was kind of expecting… a question about where I've been or something? Like, if I’ve traveled recently?
DOCTOR: Travel?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t travelled anywhere. Just work and home, mostly. Oh, and the grocery store. But… not out of the country or anything. I just thought, sometimes they ask about that stuff. Is it important? I read online about all sorts of things causing chills. It’s kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Online, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah, you know how it is. Dr. Google. I probably shouldn’t have, but… it just makes me anxious when I don’t know what’s going on. Everything seems to point to something awful. Is my breathing okay? You didn’t say anything while you were listening.
DOCTOR: Breathing's… fine. Look, you're young. Probably just a little virus. Happens all the time. We can run some basic blood work if you want, just to be sure, but honestly, I doubt it'll show anything. It’s August 2nd. Flu season's months away. You probably just need some rest and fluids.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. That makes sense. Blood work sounds… good, actually. Just to rule things out, you know? It would just give me peace of mind. I don’t want to worry my mom if I’m bringing something home to her. And… if it is something, it’s better to know, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will come get you for blood work. Don't bother looking up your results online. They're complicated. You'll hear from us if anything comes back abnormal. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I probably will look them up, but I’ll try not to freak out. And I’ll let the nurse know. Thank you, Dr. Pehrson.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. Next.
PATIENT: Okay. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: .
