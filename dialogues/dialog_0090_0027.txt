DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my stomach. Keeps… well, things come back up. Food, mostly. It’s unpleasant. Been happening a while now, really. Don't know why I even bother coming in for it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” you say. That’s not terribly helpful, Mr. Altine. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, doc, do you need a calendar entry for every bite of food? A few months, alright? Maybe six. It’s not like it’s a new thing. Happens a few times a week, usually after I eat. Big meals mostly. And lying down...that's when it's the worst. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Six months, a few times a week, worse with larger meals and when lying down. And you say it’s… food coming back up?
PATIENT: Yes, food! What else would it be? I eat dinner, and then…it tries to make a second appearance. It’s not pleasant, I’ve told you that. And it brings a bad taste with it, naturally. Honestly, it’s a waste of a perfectly good meal.
DOCTOR: "Naturally." Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this… regurgitation?
PATIENT: Regurgitation? Is that what you call it? Fancy word for throwing up. Look, no, not really. Just… heartburn sometimes. A bit of a burning feeling in my chest. Not every time, mind you. And it's not like it’s crippling, alright? Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I eat just fine, thank you very much. I might’ve gained a little during the winter, actually. My wife keeps telling me I need to watch my portions. But no, no weight loss. And frankly, I'm not here to discuss my eating habits.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you take any medications regularly, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Just the usual. Blood pressure pill. Small dose. Been on it for years. Nothing else. And I don't go for all those fancy over-the-counter things. Never really worked for me. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve eaten everything under the sun, haven’t had a problem. Dust bothers me a little, but that’s it. A normal amount, you know? Everyone gets a little bothered by dust. This is getting ridiculous. Are we getting anywhere, doc?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure. Lie down on the examination table, please. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Listen to my abdomen? Fine. Just get it over with, alright? Don’t expect miracles, I’m telling you. I’m a perfectly healthy man… apart from this stomach thing, naturally.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, and I'll listen to your abdomen in a few different spots. Try to relax. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. No obvious tenderness to palpation at this time. I'll listen to your chest as well, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Thorough, alright. All this poking and listening... Honestly. Chest? What’s the chest got to do with my stomach? You doctors always do this, don’t you? Find something that isn’t even related just to make yourselves feel better.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. It’s important to rule out other possibilities, Mr. Altine. Now, I'm going to ask you to sit up and I’ll check your throat, quickly. Throat appears normal. No signs of irritation.
PATIENT: Irritation? Of course not! I told you, everything’s perfectly normal! Look, is this going to lead to anything or what? I've got things to do, you know. And I'm getting a bit tired of lying around getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD, commonly known as acid reflux. The regurgitation, heartburn, and timing with meals are all suggestive. However, to confirm this and rule out other potential causes, I recommend an upper endoscopy. It will allow us to visualize your esophagus and stomach directly. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What’s that involve? Sounds… unpleasant. And expensive, I’ll wager. I don’t need any fancy tests. It’s just a bit of indigestion, that’s all. My father had the same thing, and he just took some baking soda. Worked fine for him. You really think I need to be stuck with a tube down my throat?
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached being gently inserted down your esophagus to view the lining. It’s not entirely comfortable, but it’s generally well-tolerated and allows us to identify any inflammation, ulcers, or other issues. While baking soda can provide temporary relief, it doesn’t address the underlying cause of the reflux and can actually worsen symptoms over time. I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine, but given the duration of your symptoms, it’s prudent to investigate further. If we don’t identify the cause, we can’t offer appropriate treatment. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist – Dr. Kowalski is excellent. He can discuss the procedure in detail, answer your questions, and determine if it’s the right course of action. Would you like me to provide a referral?
PATIENT: Kowalski… hmm. Polish name, that's good. Alright. Fine. Give me the referral. But I'm telling you, if this turns out to be a waste of time, I'm holding you personally responsible, doc. And don’t expect me to jump through any hoops. I haven't got time for all these tests. Just get it done quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I will prepare the referral to Dr. Kowalski and have it sent to your insurance provider and to you directly. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here you are. It includes his contact information and details about the procedure. I recommend you call his office as soon as possible. In the meantime, I suggest avoiding large meals, especially before lying down, and elevating the head of your bed slightly. I’m also going to recommend a trial of an over-the-counter proton pump inhibitor, like omeprazole, to help reduce stomach acid production. Do you have any further questions before we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… alright, alright. I’ll look into it. Just… get me out of here now, doc. I’ve wasted enough time already. Thanks for… nothing.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I trust the gastroenterologist will be able to provide you with a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. If you experience any worsening symptoms, or develop new concerns, please do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day. .
