DOCTOR: Hi Aron, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Um, it's my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but... yeah, my chest. It's kinda strange, 'cause... I'm a man. But it hurts, like... when you touch it.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. I understand. And you said it hurts when you touch it, so it’s tender to the touch?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Tender. That's a good word. Not like... a sharp pain all the time, more like... ouch, when I press it. It's on this side mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly on the left side. And has anything caused this to start?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I do a lot of roofing, you know? Lifting stuff, working in the sun... maybe that? But it didn't start right after a hard day. Just... started a few weeks ago. I don’t remember anything special happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks ago, and you do roofing work, so physical labor. Any pain radiating anywhere – like your arm, neck, or back?
PATIENT: No, no pain anywhere else. Just... here. It doesn't go up my arm or anything. Just… local. Like a sore muscle, but… not really? I don’t know. It's hard to explain. It feels... inside, a little bit?
DOCTOR: Alright, “inside” is good to know. And you said it feels a little different than just a sore muscle, can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yeah. A muscle... you know, if you lift something heavy, it gets sore, and it feels... on the surface, right? This feels... deeper. Like... it's not in the muscle, but behind it. And sometimes, it kinda feels... itchy? Not always, but sometimes. It's strange. I haven't told my wife about the itchy part.
DOCTOR: Okay, “deeper” pain and occasional itchiness. That’s helpful. Have you had any fever, cough, shortness of breath, or any recent illness at all, even a cold?
PATIENT: No, no fever, no cough. I haven't been sick. Not even a little cold. Everything else feels normal. I eat okay, sleep okay... just this chest thing. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything, but it worries me, you know? Especially 'cause... I'm a man. It's not something you hear about.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Aron. It’s good to get things checked out, regardless of gender. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. My legs are fine. I walk a lot at work, so I usually check 'em out. No swelling, no pain. Everything seems normal down there too. I try to keep an eye on things, working up high and all. You gotta be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat about the same. Maybe a little less when it's really hot, but... that's just the heat. And my weight... pretty much the same. I'm always skinny, even when I eat a lot. My wife always tells me to eat more! But no big changes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications. Never take anything. And no allergies that I know of. My wife says I’m too tough to be allergic to anything! I just… haven’t had any bad reactions to anything before. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your chest to see if we can pinpoint the source of the pain. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Sounds good. I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, okay? I don’t like being poked and prodded much.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath… and out. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on different areas of your chest. Please tell me if you feel any pain, and where exactly it’s located. Does this hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, right… there. When you press… yeah, that’s it. Not a sharp pain, but… definitely hurts. And a little bit here too. It kinda… radiates a little bit when you push on that one. It's not bad, but… I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting that tenderness on palpation at approximately two inches inferior to the left nipple and slight radiation with palpation slightly superior and lateral to that point. No palpable masses. I also noticed you mentioned being quite lean, Aron. Have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been skinny, like I said. Maybe a pound or two, but that’s just when it gets really hot, I don't eat as much. It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything. My wife worries about me, but I’m just naturally thin. Always have been. It’s hard to put on weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Given your description of the pain, the tenderness on palpation, and your general health history, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on without further investigation. It could be a musculoskeletal issue – something with the muscles or cartilage in your chest wall – but the occasional itching and your description of the pain feeling "deeper" warrants further investigation. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart, and the blood work will check for any signs of inflammation or infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. X-ray and blood work… If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then let’s do it. I want to know what’s going on, you know? I just… I don’t want it to be something bad. I guess it's better to be safe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Aron. It’s always better to be safe. I'll write the orders for the X-ray and blood work now. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, and you can give a blood sample at the lab next door. I'll also have the nurse provide you with instructions on how to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity that might aggravate the pain. If the pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like shortness of breath, fever, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty clearly. X-ray, blood work, no hard work… and go to the hospital if it gets worse. Okay. Just... when will I get the results? How long does it usually take? That’s probably a silly question. I just wanna know.
DOCTOR: That’s not a silly question at all, Aron. The X-ray results usually come back within a few hours, and the blood work typically takes 24-48 hours to process. The nurse will give you instructions on how to access the results online through the patient portal, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the blood work is available to discuss everything in detail. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. And don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… it’s good to know someone is taking it seriously. I’ll go do the X-ray and the blood work now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aron. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the instructions and get you set up. And remember, rest and take it easy. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
