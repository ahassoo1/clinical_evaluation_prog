DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… it’s a bit embarrassing, frankly. It’s about… a problem. A personal problem. I don't usually discuss these things, you understand. It's a discharge… from my… well, from him. My son, that is. He’s a bit… careless, you see. He’s 32, still living at home. A good boy, really, but… this is just not acceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay… I understand. So, you’re saying your son is experiencing some sort of discharge, and you’re concerned about it?
PATIENT: Concerned is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s… unsanitary, for one. And what if he gives it to someone else? It’s just… poor judgement, really. He should be more careful. I’ve told him, repeatedly. It’s not a nice thing to look at, either, I must say. Honestly, the youth of today… No respect for hygiene. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know. A week, maybe? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right, a week or so. And is he experiencing any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I haven’t exactly examined him, Doctor. You expect me to do that? I simply noticed it. He hasn’t complained of anything. Though he has been a bit… quieter than usual, now that you mention it. He’s been staying in his room more. Perhaps he’s ashamed? It would be sensible, wouldn't it? He should be, at least. It’s a dreadful situation.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no reported pain, burning, or discomfort, and he’s just been a bit withdrawn. I understand you haven't examined him, and that's perfectly alright. It would be helpful to know what the discharge looks like though, if you could describe it. Is it clear, cloudy, yellow, green, any blood?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You want details now? Really, Doctor? It’s… unpleasant to recall. It’s… whitish, I think. A bit thick. Not bright yellow, certainly. More… off-white. And there’s… a bit of odor. Not terrible, mind you. But noticeable. It’s not like roses, certainly. More… stale, perhaps? Honestly, I’d rather not dwell on it. It’s quite disturbing, you understand. I’m not a medical professional; I simply noticed a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for describing that, Jinnie. That’s helpful. It sounds like it could be a few things. It's important for your son to be seen by a doctor to figure out exactly what's going on. It could be something simple, or it could be something that needs treatment. Would he be willing to come in for an examination?
PATIENT: Oh, him? I doubt it. He’s a bit… stubborn. Thinks he knows everything, you see. He'll probably say it's nothing, just a bit of… irritation. He’s very good at making excuses. Honestly, I’ve tried to convince him, repeatedly, but he just rolls his eyes. He’d rather stay in his room playing those… video games. I suppose I could try again, but I’m not optimistic. Perhaps if you called him? A doctor’s opinion carries more weight, I suppose. Though he might just ignore the call. Honestly, it’s a lost cause, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can certainly try to reach out to him. We have a process for encouraging patients to come in for evaluation, and sometimes a call from the office does help. I’ll make a note to have a nurse contact him directly. However, without a proper examination, it’s difficult to say what’s causing this. It could be a sexually transmitted infection, a bacterial infection, or even something else. It’s really important to rule things out. I'm concerned that delaying a proper diagnosis could lead to complications. Would you be comfortable providing me with his date of birth so we can locate him in the system?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. It's… embarrassing, of course. Giving out my son's personal information like this. But if it gets him to see a doctor… Fine. Here. It’s August 12th, 1993. But honestly, I don't think he'll cooperate. He’s a very private person, you see. And he gets very defensive when anyone questions his… lifestyle choices. Don't tell him I told you that, of course. It would be dreadful. Really, I'm just doing my duty as a mother. But I doubt it will amount to anything. He’s a lost cause, I tell you. A lost cause.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jinnie. I’ve located his record. I see some previous visits with… some notes regarding potential risk factors. Given that, and the symptoms you’ve described, it’s even more important that he be evaluated as soon as possible. I’m going to have a nurse contact him and strongly encourage him to schedule an appointment within the next 48 hours. We can also offer him a confidential appointment if that would make him more comfortable. Would you like me to document your concerns in his chart as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please do document my concerns. Perhaps if he knows I’m worried… it might sway him. Confidential, you say? That’s a good idea. He’s very sensitive about… these things. Honestly, I don’t know what I’m going to do if he refuses. It’s a dreadful situation. But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying. I suppose all I can do is hope for the best. And pray. Yes, pray that he finally takes responsibility for his actions. It’s all I can do. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a cup of tea. A very strong cup of tea. This has been quite stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. We’ll do everything we can to encourage him to come in. I understand your concerns, and I’m glad we could discuss this. We’ll document everything, and the nurse will be in touch. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any further questions. And yes, a strong cup of tea sounds like a good idea. Would you like me to write you a note summarizing our conversation for your records?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Just… a brief summary, mind you. I don't want anything too detailed. Just enough to remind me what we discussed, and what the nurse will be telling him. And thank you again, Doctor. You've been very… understanding. I appreciate it. Honestly, I was dreading this visit. It's not something one discusses easily, you understand. Now, if you'll excuse me... I really must be going. I think I need to lie down. This has been… quite draining.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. Here’s the summary. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any further concerns. We’ll keep you updated. .
