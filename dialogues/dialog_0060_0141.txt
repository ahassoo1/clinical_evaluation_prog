DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doctor. It's... well, it's just this itching. Everywhere, really. It started a couple weeks ago, maybe three, and it hasn’t let up. It’s driving me a bit mad, honestly. Not painful, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Itching, hmm?
PATIENT: Yeah. It's hard to explain. It’s not like a bug bite or a rash, at least not one I can see. It feels… under the skin, almost. And it comes and goes, different spots each time. I tried some lotion, just regular stuff, but that didn’t do a thing. I was hoping you’d have some idea what it could be. I haven't changed anything in my routine, no new soaps or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right. And you say it’s everywhere?
PATIENT: Pretty much. Back, chest, arms… even my legs a little. It's not constant constant, like I said, but it feels like it moves around. It was worse on my back at first, but now it’s… well, everywhere. It’s just a nuisance, really, but a very persistent one. It keeps me up at night sometimes, scratching. I don’t know if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Well, persistent itching can be… a lot of things. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. No fever, no tiredness more than usual. My appetite’s been okay. I guess… maybe a little more thirsty than usual, but it’s been hot, you know? August heat. I haven’t noticed any changes in my… well, in my bathroom habits, if that’s what you’re thinking. Just the itching, really. It's the main thing, and honestly, it's starting to worry me because I can’t pinpoint anything that might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this started three weeks ago?
PATIENT: Roughly, yeah. It was right around… July 10th, maybe 12th. I remember because I was helping my neighbor with his garden then, and it started a day or two after that. He was using some new fertilizer, come to think of it… but I didn’t touch it myself. I just held the hose. I doubt that’s it, though. It feels… deeper than a chemical reaction, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Holding the hose… hmm. Alright. Let’s have a look at your skin. Could you please take off your shirt and have a seat?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. I hope you don’t mind, I haven't been keeping it spotless with all this gardening. It’s just a bit of a hot mess, honestly. I’ll try to be quick.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. Just get comfortable on the table, and we'll take a look. I’ll need to examine your back, chest, and arms. Just let me know if anything is tender.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Like I said, it doesn’t really hurt, just… itch. It's hard to describe. And it’s moving around, so you might not see anything at first.
DOCTOR: Hm. I’m not seeing any obvious rash or lesions, no hives. Skin is… generally normal in appearance. A little dry, perhaps, but that’s not uncommon. Arms look the same. No visible signs of irritation. Any recent insect bites you recall?
PATIENT: No, nothing I can remember. I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt most of the time when I was helping my neighbor. And I haven't been in the woods or anything like that. I live in town, mostly stick to the garden and the house. I did get a scratch on my arm a couple of weeks ago, from the rose bush, but that healed up pretty quickly. It wasn't itchy, just… a scratch.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the absence of any visible skin changes is… interesting. Itching without a rash can be caused by a number of things. We could consider allergies, though you say you haven't changed anything in your routine. It could also be something internal. Do you have any history of kidney or liver problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had my check-ups regularly, and nothing like that has ever come up. My doctor, Dr. Volkov, he’s retired now, always said I was as healthy as a horse, for my age. I mean, I have a little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I guess. I haven't taken any new medications either. I just take a little ibuprofen sometimes for the arthritis. Internal… that sounds serious.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean it is serious, but we need to rule things out. Given your history and the lack of any obvious external cause, I'd like to order some blood work. We’ll check your liver and kidney function, your complete blood count, and a few other basic markers. That will give us a better idea of what might be going on.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Blood work. Okay. I guess that's the next step. Will it be a lot? I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest. And will it take long to get the results? I’m hoping this isn’t something… too bad.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard panel, a few vials of blood. It shouldn't be too painful, and the phlebotomist is very good. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to send them over. We'll give you a call as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to moisturize your skin, and avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. You'll need to take this to the lab on Elm Street. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Elm Street… yes, I know where that is. Moisturize, avoid harsh soaps… okay. That’s… manageable. No, I don’t think so. Just… three to five days. That feels like a long time to wait, but I understand. So, it's just the blood work for now, and then we’ll see what it says? And you’ll call me?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Blood work for now, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And yes, my office will call you as soon as they’re available. Try not to worry too much, it’s likely something minor. But it's best to be thorough. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. Three to five days… I’ll try not to worry. And thank you for being… thorough. It means a lot. I’ll head to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome. Have a good day. .
