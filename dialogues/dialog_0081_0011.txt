DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, I ain’t got all day. I need a paper signed. Something about… getting a little work done. Cosmetic, they called it. A friend said I needed to get clearance from a doctor first. Don't rightly remember the details. Just need the form filled out so I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: A clearance form for cosmetic work. Right. And what kind of cosmetic work are you considering, Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… minor. A little somethin’ to tighten things up, you understand? Around the face. Lookin’ a little… droopy, if you must know. Doesn’t matter much what they do, long as they do it. Just need the paper signed so I can get it over with. Really, is that so hard? I don’t have time for a long discussion about it.
DOCTOR: It’s not that it’s hard, Mr. Honcoop, it’s that I need to understand the procedure to ensure it’s safe for you. Simply signing a form without knowing the details would be… irresponsible. Now, can you tell me the name of the facility where you’re getting this work done?
PATIENT: Facility? Hmm… Now see, that’s where my memory gets fuzzy. Some fella I met at the… the phone store, maybe? He told me about it. Real nice place, he said. Down… south somewhere? Look, I don’t remember the name. They got good prices, that's what matters. And he said I needed this here form. Is a signature all you need, or are we gonna be here all day?
DOCTOR: “Good prices” isn’t a substitute for medical oversight, Mr. Honcoop. It's concerning that you don’t know the name of the facility. Tell me, do you have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doctor, I'm sixty-four years old! What don't I have? A little arthritis, maybe. High blood pressure, probably. But nothing that’ll stop me from getting a little… touch-up. Look, I don’t go to doctors often. Never needed to. And I certainly didn’t come here to list off every ache and pain. Just sign the paper, please. I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: “A little arthritis” and “probably high blood pressure” are significant medical issues, Mr. Honcoop. Both can impact the safety of even minor procedures. Do you take any medications for either of those, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I used to take somethin’ for my knees, but I stopped. Can’t recall the name. And a little somethin’ for sleep, sometimes. But that’s it. Mostly just try to get by. Look, I'm tellin’ you, doctor, this is all unnecessary. You’re makin’ a big deal out of nothin’. Just sign the form. I don’t understand why this is so complicated!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need to know what medications you’re taking. Stopping medications without telling a doctor can be dangerous. And undergoing a procedure without proper medical evaluation could be even more so. What was the name of the medication you took for your knees?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't remember! It was a little white pill. Maybe blue. Something like… Aleve? No, that’s for pain, not… what I was takin’. It was years ago, doctor! Why does it matter now? This is ridiculous. I’m wastin’ my time here. If you won't sign the form, just say so. I’ll find another doctor. This is a complete waste of my day. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I cannot, in good conscience, sign this form without knowing more about your medical history and current medications. It would be unethical and potentially harmful. Given your lack of recall regarding important medical details and your unwillingness to provide further information, I recommend you consult with a specialist—a dermatologist—who can perform a thorough evaluation and determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure. I will provide you with a referral. Additionally, I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to review your medical history and medications. I believe that is the most responsible course of action.
