DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome! I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Rosanova! It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be honest, I've been thinking a lot lately about… mindfulness, or meditation, maybe? I keep hearing about it, and people saying how helpful it is, and I thought I'd see if it's something you think could be good for me. I work out on the tracks, you know, fixing signals and switches, and it can be… a bit stressful, even though I generally enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable, Liza. It's good you’re thinking proactively about stress management. We definitely can discuss mindfulness and if it might be a good fit for you. But first, to get a better picture, let’s talk a little bit about what’s been going on – what specifically makes your work stressful?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not usually one big thing, you know? It's more… the responsibility, I guess. If something goes wrong with a signal, it's not just a minor inconvenience. It could be… serious. And there’s always a bit of a rush to get things fixed quickly, so trains aren't delayed. I don't mind the physical work at all, honestly. I’m quite strong! But keeping everything safe and on schedule… that’s what gets to me sometimes. And sometimes the weather isn’t cooperating, which adds to it. It's just a lot to keep in your head, all at once.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That is a lot of responsibility, and the time pressure sounds significant. It’s good you recognize that. So, you’re not necessarily experiencing anxiety attacks or anything like that, but more a general feeling of being overwhelmed and stressed by the demands of the job?
PATIENT: No, no attacks, definitely not. It’s not like that at all. It's more… a constant sort of low-level worry. Like, I’m always checking and re-checking things in my head, even when I’m not at work. And I have trouble switching off, you know? I’ll be trying to relax, and then I’ll suddenly remember something I need to check, or a possible problem I need to think through. It’s exhausting, if I’m being honest. It doesn't keep me up all night, but it makes it hard to really relax and enjoy my downtime.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Liza. Sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of anticipatory anxiety, constantly thinking ahead and preparing for potential problems. It’s very common, especially in high-responsibility jobs. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this worry?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been a bit more… irritable lately, maybe? Snapping at people a little bit more than usual, which I feel terrible about. And I guess I haven’t been sleeping as well, even though I’m not exactly tossing and turning all night. Just… not as restful. And, oh! I’ve been eating more sweets, probably just as a way to comfort myself, but that can’t be good. Chocolate is my weakness, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, irritability, slightly disrupted sleep, and increased comfort eating… those can definitely be linked to stress and anxiety. And it sounds like you’re aware of those patterns, which is a really good first step. Now, let’s get a bit of a broader picture. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, a small dose, every day. And… oh! I had a knee replacement about five years ago, but it’s healed up nicely, and doesn’t bother me too much. Just a little stiff sometimes if the weather is cold. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else major. And I’m on Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for hypertension, knee replacement five years ago, and Medicare. Excellent. And, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Not to any foods, medications, or anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! Although, chocolate doesn't agree with me if I eat too much of it, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a consequence.
DOCTOR: No, that definitely doesn't count as an allergy! Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any mental health conditions, like anxiety or depression, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My grandmother, on my father’s side, was… a bit of a worrier, I suppose. Always very anxious about everything. And my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had a bit of trouble with sadness after my uncle passed away, but she didn’t really get any treatment for it, back then. They didn't talk about these things so much in Bulgaria, you know? But nobody was ever officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. It was more… just a tendency to worry a lot, or to get down sometimes.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. It's common for those patterns to run in families, even without a formal diagnosis. Okay, and just a few more questions. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all! I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol very often, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs! I’m a very sensible woman, you see. I need a clear head for my work, you know? Too much responsibility for anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. Alright, Liza, that gives me a good overall picture. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing persistent worry related to the responsibility of your job, some irritability, slightly disrupted sleep, increased comfort eating, and a family history of anxiety. You have managed hypertension, a history of knee replacement, and no allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other contributing factors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to figure out how to manage this stress a bit better, you know? I'm glad I came in to talk about it. Lead the way!
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse, just to get a baseline. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll take a quick look at your throat and ears, just to be thorough. If you could just sit up here for me, that would be great. Okay, just relax your arm… Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not dramatically so, considering your history. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation on both sides. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Ears are clear as well. Okay, everything sounds and looks good so far. Any pain or discomfort while I was doing that?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Everything felt perfectly fine. You were very gentle. It’s good to hear everything sounds okay. I always worry it's something physical going on, you know? It's good to rule that out. So, what does all this mean? Is it definitely stress, then? And… what can I do about it? I'm really hoping this mindfulness thing will help, but is there anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, Liza, based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it does sound like your symptoms are primarily related to stress and anxiety. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to keep an eye on, but it's not surprising given your history and the current stress you're experiencing. Mindfulness is a great place to start, absolutely. It can be very effective in helping you manage those racing thoughts and reduce your overall anxiety. But it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and sometimes a combination of strategies works best. We could also discuss some cognitive behavioral techniques, which help you identify and challenge those negative thought patterns. And if those aren’t enough, we can explore medication options, although that’s usually a last resort. What are your thoughts on starting with mindfulness and perhaps a referral to a therapist specializing in CBT?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I definitely want to try the mindfulness first, before resorting to medication. I'm not keen on taking pills if I can avoid it. And a therapist… well, I've never seen one before, but if you think it would help, I'm willing to try. I suppose talking it through with someone might be useful. I just… I don't want to feel like I'm overreacting, you know? It’s just… work. But you've explained it so well, it sounds like it’s more than that. So, how does the mindfulness work, exactly? And what kind of therapist would you recommend?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel hesitant, and you’re not overreacting at all. These feelings are valid, and it’s good you’re seeking help. Mindfulness is essentially about paying attention to the present moment, without judgment. There are lots of different ways to practice it – meditation, deep breathing exercises, even just focusing on your senses – the smell of coffee, the feel of your feet on the ground. The idea is to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings, without getting caught up in them. There are lots of great apps and online resources to get you started. As for a therapist, I'd recommend someone specializing in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT. They can help you identify those negative thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms. I have a list of referrals here I can give you, with therapists in the area who accept Medicare. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. A list of referrals would be a great help. And the information about the apps and online resources… that's good to know. I suppose I can start practicing on my own, and then see a therapist if I need more guidance. You've really put my mind at ease, Dr. Rosanova. Thank you. It's good to know there are options. And… is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything to help manage the stress right now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Liza. I'm glad I could help. In the meantime, focus on self-care. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep – even if it’s not perfect – and try to incorporate some regular physical activity, even if it’s just a short walk. Avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol. And practice deep breathing exercises whenever you feel overwhelmed. Just take a few slow, deep breaths – in through your nose, out through your mouth – and focus on your breath. It sounds simple, but it can be surprisingly effective. I’ll print out that referral list and some resources for mindfulness apps for you. And I'll put a note in your chart to monitor your blood pressure at your next appointment. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Rosanova. You’ve given me a lot to think about, and I feel much more hopeful now. I’ll definitely try those breathing exercises. And I'll take a look at those apps. I appreciate your time and your help. I think… I think I’m ready to get started. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Liza. Remember, it takes time and effort, but you can manage this. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please schedule a follow-up appointment in a month or two, just to check in and see how you're doing. Here’s that referral list and resource sheet. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
