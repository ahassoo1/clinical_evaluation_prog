DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day, Doctor. I woke up this morning and… well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I don’t usually bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, "alarming" is a good word to use when something changes suddenly. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… that does need to be checked out promptly. It's good you came in. Let's not worry about time right now, we’ll get this sorted. To start, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the hearing loss and the facial drooping?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you that. Around… seven, maybe? When I went to get ready. I was brushing my teeth and realized I couldn’t hear properly in my left ear. Then I looked in the mirror and… well, it’s obvious, isn’t it? One side of my face isn’t working right. It’s just… inconvenient, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, you did mention this morning. Seven o'clock. And you noticed it simultaneously—the hearing loss and the facial weakness?
PATIENT: Not exactly simultaneously. I heard the muffled sound first, then I went to look at myself in the mirror. Maybe five minutes apart. It’s not like I was doing a detailed self-assessment, Doctor. I just noticed something was wrong. Honestly, I expected more from a clinic in a…nice area like this. More efficiency, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve had the usual colds, a bit of the flu now and then, but nothing like this. I haven’t been sick recently, if that's what you're getting at. I keep myself quite healthy, actually. I eat well, and I don’t go around associating with… unwell people.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. A bit of a headache, perhaps. But I get those occasionally. Nothing… debilitating. And my taste is a little off, but that could be the coffee I had this morning. It was rather weak. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure why we’re going through this exhaustive list. It’s clearly something serious.
DOCTOR: It is serious, you are right to be concerned. And that's why I’m asking these questions. Even seemingly small details can be important. The headache... is it a typical headache for you, or is it different in any way?
PATIENT: It's… harder to describe. It's not a throbbing headache. More of a… pressure. Behind my eye, I think. And it's on the same side as the ear that's bothering me. But honestly, I don’t spend my time analyzing my headaches. I take a pill and move on. Look, are we going to do something, or are we just going to keep chatting?
DOCTOR: We are going to do something, Ms. Nissenbaum. But I need to gather information first. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I take care of myself. I told you that. Look, I’m a radiologist, Doctor. I know about health. I don't have health problems. I haven’t needed to see a doctor in years, apart from a routine check-up, which I only did because someone insisted. Honestly, I find this whole process rather…degrading.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate you sharing that. And I respect your profession. However, even radiologists can experience unexpected medical issues. It's important to gather all the information to ensure we reach the correct conclusion. Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I've been fortunate enough to avoid all of that. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, if you want to count that. It was decades ago. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite unwell just sitting here. Is this examination going to take much longer? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, then we’ll do a quick examination. Family history – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: My mother had… high blood pressure, I suppose. And my brother had something with his heart, a long time ago. But they both lived long lives. Honestly, I don't keep track of all of that. It's not my concern. People get sick, that’s just life. I’m more concerned about my health at the moment. And frankly, I'm not feeling any better.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take medications. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. I take care of myself. Look, are we finished with the questioning yet? I really need to get going. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. I have enough information for now. Given your symptoms – the sudden hearing loss, facial drooping, and the pressure behind your eye – and the quick onset, I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke. We need to rule that out immediately. I’m going to need to do a brief neurological examination and then I'll order some imaging, specifically an MRI of your brain. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I proceed?
PATIENT: An MRI? A stroke? Good heavens. This is… alarming. No allergies. None whatsoever. But…an MRI will take a long time, won’t it? And what if it is a stroke? What does that even mean? Honestly, I should probably call my… never mind. No, just… let's get it over with. Just please be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you don’t have any allergies. An MRI will take about 30-45 minutes, and it's the best way to determine what's going on. I will explain everything to you as we go. And we'll discuss the implications of the results when we have them. First, let’s start with a quick exam. Could you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But I warn you, I have a bad back. I spend far too long looking at scans. And please be gentle. I’m not used to being… prodded. Honestly, this is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your vision. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can see perfectly well. Don’t patronize me, Doctor. I examine images all day! Move it left… right… up… down. Perfectly clear. Honestly, I think this is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me when I touch your forehead, and then your cheeks, on both sides?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel it. Perfectly normal sensation. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite… faint. Are you sure you’re qualified to do this? This is all very… unsettling. And my back is killing me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s try one more thing. I’m going to ask you to smile for me. And then I want you to raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. Please try to resist me as I try to open your eyelid. This will check the strength of your facial muscles.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is ridiculous. I told you my face feels droopy! You're just confirming what I already know. This isn't helping. It’s making me anxious, and frankly, I feel…quite humiliated. Are we going to get to the MRI soon, or are you going to continue… poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are right. Based on your symptoms and the brief exam, I am even more concerned. The weakness on one side of your face, combined with the sudden onset hearing loss, is very concerning. We need to rule out a stroke, or a similar neurological event, as quickly as possible. I'm going to arrange for you to have an MRI right away. I’ll also be consulting with neurology to get their opinion. In the meantime, I’m going to ask a nurse to take your blood pressure and pulse. Do you have anyone we can contact for you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. An MRI. Neurology. It's all so… alarming. No, don't contact anyone. I… I’m alone. My husband… passed away a few years ago. And my son… he lives overseas. I don’t want to worry him unnecessarily. Just… just do whatever you need to do. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll take very good care of you, Ms. Nissenbaum. The nurse will be in shortly. I’ll explain the MRI procedure to you again while we wait, and I’ll be back to answer any questions you have. We’ll get through this. Just remember, we're acting quickly, and that’s the most important thing. We’ll have a better understanding of what’s happening soon.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…please hurry. I… I don’t like feeling like this. It’s… terrifying. .
DOCTOR: I understand. We will. I’ll be right back with the nurse. .
