DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need one of those cards to drive for a ride-share company. You know, Uber, Lyft… things like that. I understand I need a medical card for commercial driving? I'm 70, so… things are a little different these days.
DOCTOR: Right. A commercial driver's license… or, a medical certification for commercial driving, yes. I see. So you’re looking to get certified to drive for a ride-sharing service. And you’re… anticipating a problem with the medical exam due to your age?
PATIENT: Not necessarily a problem, Doctor. Just… I imagine you'll want to check a few extra things. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I wear glasses. And my knees… well, let's just say logging equipment isn't kind to the joints after all these years. I mostly want to be upfront about everything so there are no surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Honesty is good, Mrs. Sciarotta. We will need to do a thorough exam. It's not just about whether you can drive, it's about ensuring the safety of yourself and others on the road. We'll check your vision, reflexes, musculoskeletal health… a standard cardiovascular assessment as well. Do you have a list of any medications you’re currently taking, or any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I have my glasses case here with a list my daughter made for me. Here it is. Just a blood pressure medication – Lisinopril, 20mg daily – and something for my arthritis, Celecoxib. No allergies that I know of. Though, I did have a bad reaction to penicillin when I was a little girl, but that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril and Celecoxib. Good to know. And the penicillin allergy – we'll certainly keep that in mind. Have you had any other significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out about 15 years ago. And a hip replacement ten years ago, on the left side. That’s about it, really. Nothing major since then. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy fifteen years ago and a left hip replacement ten years ago. And you mentioned arthritis, is that primarily in your knees?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly in my knees, but my hands get a little stiff sometimes too. It flares up depending on the weather, you know? Cold weather makes it worse. But it's manageable with the Celecoxib and I try to stay active when I can. I don’t want to just sit around!
DOCTOR: Staying active is good, Mrs. Sciarotta, but we have to be realistic about what that means in light of the demands of commercial driving. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. A little creaky, but I’m standing. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to check your vital signs first. Blood pressure, pulse… Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72 and regular. Not bad, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It’s a little awkward, my hips aren’t as flexible as they used to be. But they’re crossed. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are… diminished, but present bilaterally. A little slower than I’d like, but not alarming. Now, let’s check your vision. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here they are. Everything looks a little blurry without them, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay. With glasses… your vision is 20/30 in the right eye and 20/40 in the left. That’s… acceptable, but we might want to consider a referral to an optometrist for a more comprehensive exam. Now, let’s check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, Doctor. Not anymore. My knees just won’t allow it. It's very limited. I can reach my shins, maybe. But definitely not my toes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited range of motion in the lumbar spine and hips, as expected. And you mentioned pain with movement. On a scale of zero to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain in your knees right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? Probably a 3 or 4. It's not constant, but it's always there, you know? Especially when the weather is changing. It’s a dull ache, not sharp. And it gets worse when I try to do anything strenuous.
DOCTOR: Alright, a 3 or 4 with a dull ache. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds… regular. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Not concerning, but we’ll keep it in mind. Okay. Final question: have you had any episodes of dizziness or loss of consciousness in the past year?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I haven't had any dizziness or anything like that. I get a little lightheaded sometimes if I stand up too quickly, but nothing serious. Just old age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. We've covered a lot of ground. Based on my examination, there are a few things we need to address before I can clear you for commercial driving. Your vision, while acceptable with glasses, is borderline. Your limited range of motion and pain in your knees are concerning. And the diminished breath sounds, while not alarming, warrant further investigation. I'm going to recommend a referral to both an optometrist for a comprehensive eye exam and a pulmonologist for a full lung function test. I also think you should see a rheumatologist to evaluate your arthritis and discuss potential treatment options. I'm not comfortable clearing you for commercial driving at this time. It would be a liability.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Well… that’s not what I hoped to hear. I understand, Doctor. Safety is important. So… that means I probably shouldn’t even try to apply for the card right now, then? It’s just… I was hoping to supplement my income a little.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Mrs. Sciarotta. Applying for the card at this time would be… premature. It’s better to address these underlying health concerns first. I understand your desire to supplement your income, but operating a vehicle requires full physical and cognitive capacity. We can reassess after you’ve seen the specialists and received their recommendations. I’ll write you the referrals now. And I want to be clear: I’m not saying it’s impossible for you to drive commercially in the future, but you need to be in optimal health. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. It's just… a lot to take in. How long do you think it will take to get appointments with the specialists? And… will my Medicare cover these visits? That’s probably a silly question.
DOCTOR: It can take a few weeks to get appointments with the specialists, depending on their availability. I’ll have my staff assist you with scheduling. As for Medicare coverage… yes, thankfully, Medicare should cover most of the cost of these visits, assuming they are deemed medically necessary. However, there may be co-pays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. My staff can also help you verify your coverage. I’ll write a detailed summary of my findings for each specialist to expedite the process. Here’s the referral paperwork. And I'll have the staff print out a list of resources for seniors in the area. Do you have any other questions before you leave today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for being honest with me. It’s… disappointing, but I understand. I'll call and get those appointments scheduled. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Mrs. Sciarotta. And don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. .
