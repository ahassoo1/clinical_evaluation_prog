DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s nice to meet you too. Dr. Glowka, you say? Well… it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling poorly for a bit now. It’s hard to explain… I just don’t seem to be able to eat much, and when I do eat, I feel full awful quick. And then… well, then I feel sick. It’s been going on for a few weeks, I reckon. Longer maybe? Time… time just slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It can be difficult to keep track of time, and it's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the exact duration. So, it sounds like you're experiencing a decreased appetite and early fullness, often accompanied by feeling unwell after eating. Could you describe what you mean by "feeling sick"?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. Decreased appetite… that sounds fancy! Feeling sick… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like I’ve broken anything. It’s more… queasy. Like I might… well, you know. And sometimes it comes up, sometimes it doesn't. It just feels… unsettled. And tired. I get awful tired after trying to eat, even if I only have a little bit. It's… uncomfortable, to say the least. I mostly just nibble on things now, things I think will stay down. It's not much, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea and occasional vomiting, along with fatigue after eating, and you've noticed it's led to eating less. You mentioned you're trying to stick to foods you think will stay down – can you give me a few examples of what those are?
PATIENT: Oh, land. Let me think… Well, toast. Plain toast. That usually stays down alright. And… crackers. Saltines. And sometimes… a little bit of broth. Chicken broth. Not too hot, though. Anything heavy… anything with a lot of flavor… that’s when the trouble starts. I used to love a good stew, but… not anymore. Makes me feel dreadful. It’s been a while since I’ve had a proper meal, I’ll tell you that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so plain toast, saltine crackers, and chicken broth seem to be the most tolerable foods for you right now. And heavier, more flavorful foods tend to worsen your symptoms. Have you noticed any other triggers for the nausea or vomiting – anything besides the type of food?
PATIENT: Hmm… Triggers… well, not really. I don’t think so. I used to be able to eat anything, anytime. Now… it just seems random. Sometimes it’s fine, sometimes it’s not. Maybe… maybe when I get excited? Like, if I’m looking forward to something, and then… it doesn’t go right. Then it acts up. But that might just be my imagination. It’s hard to say. My old bones don’t work like they used to, that’s for certain. And sometimes… I get a little dizzy too. Not often, but… it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the symptoms can be somewhat unpredictable, and potentially linked to excitement or anticipation, although you’re right, it could be coincidental. And you've also experienced some dizziness at times. Ms. Kelder, do you have any other symptoms – anything at all – that you haven’t mentioned yet?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Well… I’ve been losing weight, I reckon. My clothes are a little looser than they used to be. And… I get tired easily, even without eating. Just… generally run down. Oh! And my tummy… it sometimes feels bloated, even when it’s empty. Like it’s full of air. That’s… unpleasant. And… now that you mention it, I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. Not like I used to be. Sorry to be so blunt. It's just… everything feels off, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re not being blunt at all, Ms. Kelder. It’s very helpful for me to have a complete picture of what you’re experiencing. So, to summarize, you've noticed unintentional weight loss, general fatigue, abdominal bloating, and a change in your bowel habits. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. I haven't taken my temperature in… well, I don't rightly remember the last time I took my temperature. Chills… sometimes I get a little cold, but that’s just the old bones acting up. And night sweats… no, I don't think so. I sleep pretty soundly, usually. Though I do wake up a couple of times during the night, just to… use the restroom, mostly. But no sweats, no. Just… tired. Awfully tired. And… now that you mention it, my appetite… it started getting worse around the same time I started feeling more… anxious. I don’t usually get anxious, but things have been… unsettling lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like we have a good amount of information now. Decreased appetite, early fullness, nausea, occasional vomiting, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, abdominal bloating, changes in bowel habits, and you've linked the onset of these symptoms to increased anxiety. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My past medical history… Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must be… forty years ago now? And I had a hip replacement a few years back, that went alright. Other than that… I haven’t been too sick. I’ve always been pretty healthy, up until recently. I see Dr. Miller for my arthritis, he keeps me going with the medication. And… I had some skin cancer removed from my arm a while back, but that’s all been taken care of. I'm on Medicare, if that's important. I used to have a good strong constitution, but… I don't know what's going on now. It’s just… different. And… my husband, bless his soul, he passed away five years ago. It’s been lonely since then.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Kelder. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. So, you've had your gallbladder removed, a hip replacement, you’re treated for arthritis by Dr. Miller, and a history of skin cancer that's been removed. And you’ve experienced a loss with the passing of your husband five years ago. I'm very sorry for your loss. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides those for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It was a long time ago, but… you never quite forget, do you? No, just the arthritis medication. Dr. Miller prescribes it. It’s a little blue pill, I take it twice a day. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my knees, if they’re acting up. But that’s it. Mostly just the blue pill, twice a day. I try to take it regularly, but… sometimes I forget. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? I don't take anything else regularly. And… I try to eat healthy, but… it’s hard when you don’t feel like eating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking medication for arthritis prescribed by Dr. Miller, and occasionally an over-the-counter pain reliever for your knees. And you mentioned some difficulty with remembering to take your medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. No allergies to food, no allergies to medications… I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I was a kid, but that was just poison ivy, I reckon. Nothing serious. No, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder, thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and a general assessment. It’s just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. I haven’t had a proper exam in a while, so… it’ll be good to know what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? Whatever you need to do, just let me know. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. General appearance is within normal limits, though some mild weight loss is apparent. Okay, Ms. Kelder. Based on the exam and the history you’ve provided, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your symptoms – decreased appetite, early fullness, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss – could be indicative of several things. Given your age and the diminished bowel sounds, we should rule out any potential issues with your gastrointestinal tract. I recommend we start with some blood work and a stool test to assess your overall health and check for any inflammation or infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… thorough. Blood work and a stool test… Well, if that’s what you think is best, dear. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I don't mind the tests, as long as they help figure out what’s wrong. Inflammation… infection… that doesn’t sound good. But if that’s what it is, then it’s best to know, right? Yes, go ahead and do the tests. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. Will the tests take long? And will they be painful?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Kelder. The blood work is fairly standard – a simple draw from your arm. It will take just a few minutes, and there might be a slight pinch. As for the stool test, it involves collecting a small sample, which you can do at home. We’ll provide you with instructions, and it’s a very straightforward process. It won’t be painful at all. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss the next steps. While we wait, I would also like to recommend some dietary changes. Eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding fatty or spicy foods, and staying well-hydrated can help manage your symptoms. I want to assure you that we're taking a cautious approach, and we’ll rule out any potential serious causes. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, smaller meals… I've already been doing that, mostly. And avoiding fatty foods… that's been hard, but I've been trying. Staying hydrated… yes, I can do that. Water's good. So, blood work and a stool test… and then we wait. That sounds… manageable. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, dear. It makes me feel a lot better, knowing what to expect. And I appreciate you taking your time with me. It's just… lonely sometimes, you know? Having someone listen. Yes, let's do the tests. And thank you, Dr. Glowka. Thank you for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It’s my pleasure. And please know that you’re not alone. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Now, my nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the instructions for the stool test. If you have any questions at all before then, please don’t hesitate to ask. We also have some informational brochures on managing digestive health that I can provide for you. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, dear. Information brochures… yes, that would be lovely. And… no, I don’t think so. I believe that’s all. Just… thank you again. For listening, for explaining, for being so patient. It's… nice to have someone care. I think I’m ready for the nurse now. Just… let me take a deep breath. Yes. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you think of anything else. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll let you rest now, and the nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder. And remember, we’re here for you.
PATIENT: .
