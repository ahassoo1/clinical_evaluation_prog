DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Seil. The pleasure is all mine. I am here… because things have been… not as they should be with my memory, recently. It is… troubling, and my blood pressure has been quite high. I want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Alvara. It’s good you’re addressing these concerns. Memory issues and high blood pressure are definitely things we want to investigate. Let’s start with your memory concerns. Could you describe what you mean by “not as they should be”?
PATIENT: Well, it is difficult to explain precisely. I remember… everything, usually. Dates, names, little details… But lately, I find I… misplace things more often. Not important things, not yet. But I will be speaking with someone, and… a word will simply vanish from my mind. Or I will go into a room, and forget why I went there. It is… unsettling. It does not happen all the time, but it happens enough to worry me. And it feels… different than simply being absentminded.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating and concerning, especially when it feels different from typical forgetfulness. It’s good you’re noticing these changes and bringing them to my attention. To help me get a better understanding, can you tell me roughly when you first started noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… three, maybe four months ago? It began very subtly. I thought it was simply stress, at first. There was… a great deal happening. But it has not improved, and… if anything, it is becoming more frequent. It is not a sudden change, Doctor. A gradual one.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s helpful to know. A gradual onset is important information. Now, you also mentioned high blood pressure. Do you know what your readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Yes. My… neighbor, she is a retired nurse, very kind woman. She checks it for me regularly. Last time… it was 160 over 95, I believe. And sometimes it is even higher. I do not take medication for it. I try to watch my salt intake, but… it is difficult. I enjoy cooking, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good you’re monitoring it and trying to manage it with diet. 160 over 95 is elevated, and consistent monitoring is very important. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the high blood pressure – headaches, dizziness, vision changes, chest pain, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Let me see… Headaches, yes, sometimes. Not severe, but a dull ache at the back of my head. Dizziness… occasionally, when I stand up too quickly. And… …my vision has been a little blurry, yes. I thought it was simply my age, to be honest. No chest pain, no shortness of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. A dull headache, occasional dizziness upon standing, and blurry vision along with the elevated blood pressure and memory concerns are all things we want to investigate. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I have had… the usual things, I suppose. A cold here and there. The flu, once. But no… serious illnesses. I was a very healthy child, and I have always tried to stay active. I enjoy gardening, and I walk every day, when the weather permits. My late husband… he had some heart trouble, but that was… years ago. It did not affect me, directly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. Knowing your husband had heart trouble is also helpful family history information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. Perhaps… twenty years ago? It was a… routine procedure. And… I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That was… a difficult time. But both procedures went well, and I recovered fully. No complications, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. I prefer… natural remedies, when possible. A little chamomile tea for sleep, sometimes. But nothing… prescribed. I try to avoid pills, if I can. I believe in… letting the body heal itself, when possible.
DOCTOR: I understand and respect your preference for natural remedies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to anything. My husband… he was allergic to bee stings, quite severely. But I myself… no allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Ms. Alvara, thank you for providing all of this information. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever is necessary. I want to understand what is happening, and I trust your judgment. Please, proceed. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Ms. Alvara, I’m going to take your blood pressure again. Try to relax. Okay, your blood pressure is 162 over 98. A bit elevated, as we discussed. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, a little strong, but no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and do a brief cognitive assessment. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… It is… August second. August second, 2025. Yes, that is correct. Is something wrong? I… it felt a little difficult to recall, just now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Alvara. It’s normal to hesitate sometimes. Now, can you repeat after me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please proceed. I am ready to repeat whatever you say.
DOCTOR: Okay. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
PATIENT: “The… quick… brown… fox… jumps… over… the… lazy… dog.” Did I… say it correctly? It felt a little… slow, perhaps. I apologize if I am not performing this… test properly.
DOCTOR: You said it perfectly, Ms. Alvara. No need to apologize. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. What city are we in?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. This is a… rural area, is it not? I do not recall the name of the city… or even if we are in a city. I know I travelled some distance to get here… from my home. But… the name escapes me. I apologize. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Alvara. Don’t apologize. It’s important to understand what's going on, and we are working through it. Okay. Let's move on to a final quick test. I’m going to show you three objects - a pen, a key, and a coin. I’ll ask you to remember them for a few minutes. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A pen, a key, and a coin. I can remember those. I am trying very hard to concentrate. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, now I’m going to ask you to tell me what three objects I just showed you. Take your time.
PATIENT: There was… a pen, yes. And a… a key. And… I… I can’t remember the third object. It is… on the tip of my tongue. It was something small… metal… but the name… it escapes me. I am so sorry. This is… very unsettling.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Alvara. Don’t be sorry. This is valuable information. Okay, that’s enough for the quick assessment. Based on what I’ve seen during the physical exam and the cognitive testing, you have some memory impairment, specifically with recent recall. Your blood pressure is elevated as well. Given your symptoms and the findings today, I suspect a couple of possibilities. The memory issues could be related to the high blood pressure – it can affect blood flow to the brain. However, other causes such as early stages of dementia or medication side effects need to be ruled out. I recommend a few further tests. We'll need some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out other causes for the memory issues. I also want to order a CT scan of your brain to get a better look and rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I’d like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation of your memory and cognitive function. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and blood work… and a neurologist… That sounds… extensive, Doctor. But if it is necessary to understand what is happening… then yes, I agree. I want to know what is causing these memory problems. Whatever you recommend, Doctor, I will do. I trust your judgment. But… how long will this take? And will these tests be… painful? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Alvara. It's good to be informed. The blood work is a simple process – we’ll just draw a small sample from your arm. It should only take a few minutes, and there’s minimal discomfort – just a brief pinch. The CT scan is a bit more involved. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It's painless, but you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes. We'll provide you with clear instructions and make sure you’re comfortable. As for how long it will take, getting the results of the blood work usually takes a few days, and the CT scan results will be available in about a week. We can schedule an appointment with the neurologist as soon as possible – likely within the next couple of weeks. I’ll write up the orders for the blood work and CT scan, and my nurse will schedule those for you. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a low-sodium diet, regular exercise , and stress reduction techniques. I'm also going to prescribe a medication to help lower your blood pressure. It’s a low dose, and we’ll monitor your response closely. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A low-sodium diet… regular exercise… stress reduction… and medication… Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. I can try to implement those changes. I enjoy cooking, but I suppose I can adjust my recipes. And I do enjoy walking, so that shouldn't be difficult. But… what if the medication has side effects? And what if the tests reveal something… serious? I apologize for being so… anxious. It is simply… unsettling, not knowing what is happening.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Alvara. It’s never easy facing uncertainty. We’ll discuss potential side effects of the medication before you start taking it, and we’ll monitor you closely for any adverse reactions. Most people tolerate blood pressure medications very well. As for the test results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and create a plan together, whatever they may show. We’ll face it together, and I'll be here to support you every step of the way. This medication is called Lisinopril, 5mg once daily. Start with one tablet in the morning. I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible, and write down your readings. We'll review those at your follow-up appointment. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions about the referral or the medication?
PATIENT: Dr. Anya Sharma… No, I do not have any questions at the moment, Doctor. But… If I experience any… unusual symptoms after taking the medication… what should I do? And how often should I check my blood pressure? I do not want to cause any unnecessary worry, but I want to be prepared. This is all… a great deal to take in.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Alvara. If you experience any unusual symptoms after starting the Lisinopril – such as dizziness, lightheadedness, persistent cough, swelling of the face or throat, or difficulty breathing – stop taking the medication immediately and contact my office or go to the nearest emergency room. As for checking your blood pressure, I recommend checking it twice a day – once in the morning before taking your medication, and once in the evening. Write down your readings each time, and bring them with you to your follow-up appointment. I’m also going to give you a patient information sheet about Lisinopril, which includes a more detailed list of potential side effects and instructions. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Twice a day… morning and evening… and bring the readings to the follow-up… No, Doctor, I do not think I have any other questions at the moment. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I feel… a little overwhelmed, but also… reassured. Knowing that there is a plan… it helps. Thank you, Doctor Seil. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Alvara. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, we'll face this together. My nurse will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again. I will… be in touch. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Alvara. Take care. .
