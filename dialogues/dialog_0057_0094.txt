DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. My name is Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... good morning. I think... my husband said I should come. Something about... learning things? I don't really remember. It's just a check-up, right? Not... anything bad?
DOCTOR: It sounds like this might be a bit of a general check-up, yes. And it's perfectly alright if you're not sure why you're here – sometimes it's good to just get things checked out. We can definitely do a full check-up. Before we start, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately...? Oh. Work is... work. Sheet metal is heavy. My back gets sore, sometimes. And I get tired. But everyone gets tired, right? I don’t… I don't know what you want me to say lately. It's just normal stuff.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. "Normal stuff" is a good place to start. You mentioned your back gets sore from work – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It's just... achey. Like, after I lift a lot of the metal. Especially the big sheets. It's not… sharp pain. Just… heavy. And it doesn't go away after I rest sometimes. My husband, he rubs it, but... it doesn't really help, you know? It's been happening for... a while now. Maybe months? I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, months of back soreness, especially after lifting at work. And rubbing it doesn’t seem to provide much relief. Do you notice anything that does make it feel better, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Hmm... Not really. Maybe... when I'm not at work? Just sitting. But then I'm just… sitting. That's not really doing anything, is it? I don't know. I just try to ignore it, mostly. My husband tells me to take pills, but I don't like taking pills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're trying to manage it, and it's okay that you prefer not to take medication if you don't want to. We can explore other options. Before we go further, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms...? Like... what kind of symptoms? I feel... normal? Tired, like I said. Sometimes my hands get a little numb, but that's from the metal, I think. Holding the shears all day... it cuts off the feeling. Is that a symptom? I don't know what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we'll figure it out. You mentioned numbness in your hands – that could be related to the work, or it could be something else. Just trying to get a full picture. Do you experience any pain anywhere besides your back?
PATIENT: Well... sometimes my shoulder hurts. The one on this side. It feels… tight. Like a knot. I just thought it was from sleeping funny. I don't really pay attention to it unless it gets really bad. It's probably nothing. Is it bad if my shoulder hurts?
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulder pain on your right side, feeling tight like a knot. It’s good you’re telling me about this. No, it’s not necessarily “bad” that it hurts, but it's good information for us to have. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats lately?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't been sick. Chills... maybe when it's cold outside? But everyone gets chills when it's cold. Night sweats? I don't... I just sleep. I don't really notice. My husband would probably know if I was sweating a lot. He says I snore, but that's not sweating, is it?
DOCTOR: No, snoring isn't sweating! It sounds like you haven’t been experiencing fever, chills, or night sweats. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or supplements?
PATIENT: No! I told you, I don't like taking pills. I don't take anything. Not even for headaches. I just... deal with it. My husband keeps offering me stuff, but I refuse. He takes a lot of things, though. Vitamins and... I don't know, all kinds of things. But I don't.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies...? Hmm. I don't think so. I eat everything. My husband is the picky eater, not me. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when I'm working with the metal, but that's just the dust, right? Everyone gets itchy from dust.
DOCTOR: It's possible the itching is from the metal dust. So, no known medication or food allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic…? Like… long-term sickness? No. I’ve always been healthy. Well, mostly. I get tired, like I said, but everyone gets tired. My husband, he worries too much. He says his mother had something… with her blood, but I don't remember what. I’ve never had anything serious, though. Nothing the doctor ever told me about.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known chronic medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? I don't think so. Maybe when I was little? My mother said something about my tonsils, but I don’t remember it. It was a long time ago. I haven't had any surgeries as an adult, definitely. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible tonsillectomy as a child, but no surgeries as an adult. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or grandparents – has any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she died a long time ago. I don't remember what she died of. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He was always tired. And my husband's mother… she had something with her blood sugar. He worries about that a lot. That's all I really remember. We don't really talk about it. It's sad.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's alright. It's common not to know all the details. Okay, so a history of heart problems in your father and blood sugar issues in your husband’s mother. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. That's terrible. My husband smokes, but I tell him to go outside. Alcohol… sometimes, a little bit of wine with dinner. But not much. And drugs? Absolutely not! I would never. What kind of question is that?
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was uncomfortable. I just need to get a complete picture of your health. So, you don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol, and don't use any drugs. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Like I said, I work with sheet metal. It’s heavy. I cut it, bend it, put it together. It's… hard work. I've been doing it for… a long time. Ten years, maybe? It's not a fancy job, but it pays the bills. I'm on my feet all day. Lots of lifting. And it's loud. Very loud. Sometimes my ears ring. But you get used to it.
DOCTOR: Ten years of working with sheet metal, lifting heavy materials, and exposure to loud noise. Okay, that's very helpful. Airam, I think it’s time to do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your back and shoulders to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? I don’t like doctors touching me… but… I guess. If you have to. But be gentle, okay? And don’t take too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and we will take our time. We'll start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… but hurry, please? I don't like being in here for too long. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relaxing your arm for me. 140/90. That's a little elevated. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally for me, in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, but you're taking slightly shallow breaths. Now, I’m going to need to examine your back and shoulders. Could you please bend forward at the waist and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Ouch… that’s… not easy. It hurts when I bend like this. See? My back. It's always sore. It’s much better when I’m sitting. Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. There's definite tenderness along your lower spine, and some muscle tightness. I’m also feeling some trigger points. It seems like you have a strain in your lower back muscles. And your right shoulder… there's also tenderness and tightness here. You may have some inflammation in the rotator cuff. Based on the exam, it looks like you’re experiencing both lower back strain and possible rotator cuff inflammation in your right shoulder, likely related to the physical demands of your job. We need to rule out other possibilities, so I'd like to order some X-rays of your back and shoulder. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-rays…? That sounds… serious. Are you saying something is really wrong? I just thought it was sore muscles. I don’t like X-rays. Is there another way? I don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Airam. X-rays are a standard way to get a better look at your bones and rule out any fractures or other structural problems. It doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong – it's just a precaution. We could try conservative treatment first – physical therapy, pain medication, and modifying your work activities. However, without the X-rays, we won’t have a complete picture, and it might delay proper treatment if there is a more significant issue. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. But I strongly recommend the X-rays to ensure we're addressing the problem effectively. We can discuss the results and create a treatment plan that works for you. Would you like me to explain the X-ray procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine… but hurry. And explain everything. I don't want any surprises. What does it feel like? And how long will it take? And will it hurt? I really don't like hospitals… or doctors… or anything like this. Just tell me everything. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Airam. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. The X-ray procedure itself is very quick and painless. You'll sit or stand in front of a special machine, and a small amount of radiation will pass through your body to create an image of your bones on a screen. It’s similar to getting a photograph. You won’t feel anything at all during the process. The whole thing will only take a few minutes, maybe five or ten at most. The technician will position you carefully to get the best images. You’ll need to stay still during the procedure so the images don't get blurry. We’ll send the images to a radiologist, a doctor who specializes in interpreting X-rays, and they’ll send us a report with their findings. We'll then discuss the results with you and create a treatment plan. The biggest risk is a very small amount of radiation exposure, but it's a minimal amount and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. Would you like me to schedule the X-rays for you now?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. And make sure it’s quick. And… and be gentle. I need to go to work tomorrow. I can’t be in too much pain. What if it shows something… bad? Don't tell me if it's something terrible, okay? Just… just do the X-rays.
DOCTOR: Of course, Airam. I will make sure it's as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your concerns, and I'll do everything I can to ensure your comfort. And we will discuss the results together, step by step. I won't overwhelm you with information, and we'll address any concerns you have at your own pace. Okay, let me schedule the X-rays for you. There's a radiology center just down the street. They have appointments available tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Two o'clock… I guess so. It's better than waiting longer. But I need to go to work afterwards. And… and if it hurts a lot, what do I do? Will they give me something for the pain? Just… make sure it doesn't take too long. And don’t let them hurt me.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2:00 PM it is. And don't worry, Airam. The radiology center will do everything they can to make you comfortable. If you experience any pain after the X-rays, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If the pain is severe, we can discuss stronger options. I will also write you a prescription just in case, for something stronger, but I want you to try the over-the-counter medications first. Here's a referral slip for the radiology center, and a prescription for a pain reliever, just in case. The radiology center will call us with the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I guess. I really don’t like this, but… thank you. I hope it doesn’t hurt too much. And… and can I get a note for work? Just in case I need to take some time off?
DOCTOR: Of course, Airam. I can absolutely write you a note for work. Here you go. This note explains that you had a medical appointment and may need some time off if you experience discomfort. I hope everything goes smoothly at the radiology center. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. And please, take care of yourself. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again. I’m going to go now. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Airam. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up.
