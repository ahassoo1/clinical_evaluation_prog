DOCTOR: "Bula and welcome, Mr. Verbos! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good day to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather a bothersome thing, actually. I seem to be… going to the restroom quite a lot. More than usual, you understand. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I couldn’t say exactly how long. A while, certainly. I apologize for the vagueness. It's just… things aren’t as sharp as they once were, you know?
DOCTOR: “No worries at all, Mr. Verbos, it’s perfectly alright. It can be tricky to pinpoint these things. Frequent urination can be caused by a lot of different things, so we'll figure it out. When you say ‘quite a lot’, could you give me a rough idea – like, how many times a day would you say you're going compared to, say, a typical day before this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. A typical day… let me think. Before… well, before this started, perhaps two or three times. Now? Oh dear. It feels like… every couple of hours. Perhaps six, seven times? It's… disruptive, to say the least. And at night, too, I’m afraid. Which is most inconvenient. I do apologize for not being more precise. It’s difficult to keep track, you see.
DOCTOR: “That’s helpful to know, thank you. Six or seven times a day is definitely a change from two or three. And having to get up at night is particularly bothersome, I agree. Do you find yourself needing to go urgently – like, feeling a strong, sudden need to go right away?
PATIENT: Yes, that happens… sometimes. Not every time, but often enough to be worrying. It’s… a strong feeling. And it comes on rather quickly. I try to plan my outings accordingly, of course. It's… not ideal. I wouldn't say it's painful, exactly, just… insistent.
DOCTOR: “Okay, ‘insistent’ is a good way to put it. No pain is good. Now, besides the frequency and the urgency, have you noticed any other changes – like, in the color or smell of your urine, or any discomfort when you are going?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me consider… the color seems… normal, I believe. Perhaps a little paler than usual, but nothing alarming. As for the smell… I don’t believe so. I’m not one to pay terribly close attention to such things, I confess. And no, no discomfort when I go, thankfully. Just… the frequency and the urgency, as I said. It’s… quite a relief that there isn’t any pain, to be sure.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to hear about the lack of pain. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I… I had my share of ailments over the years, of course. Nothing major, I don't think. My memory isn't what it used to be. I believe I was told, some time ago, that my blood pressure was a little… elevated. And the doctor mentioned something about my sugar levels… but I'm afraid the details escape me. I was prescribed some medication, I think, for the blood pressure. I’m taking it regularly, I believe. I really should check the bottle to be sure.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that's helpful. It’s good you’re on medication for blood pressure, and we’ll definitely make sure you’re on the right dose. Do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, I’m afraid not. It’s a small, white pill, I believe. And I take it… every morning, with breakfast. I get the prescription refilled regularly at the pharmacy down the street. Old Man Hemlock runs it, a very nice fellow. I should probably write these things down, shouldn’t I? I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: “No bother at all, Mr. Verbos. It’s very common to forget details about medications. We can look it up in our system, or I can ask Old Man Hemlock next time I’m in town. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Now that you mention it… I had my appendix removed, many years ago. Must have been… oh, goodness, in my thirties, I suppose. And I was hospitalized once, when I was younger, with a rather nasty bout of pneumonia. That was… unpleasant. Other than that… I can’t recall anything significant. I lead a rather quiet life, you see. Mostly gardening and reading.
DOCTOR: “Okay, appendix removal and pneumonia – good to know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she suffered from heart trouble, as I recall. And my father… he had some sort of… ailment with his kidneys, I believe. Nothing terribly serious, as far as I know. My sister… she was quite healthy, thankfully. But other than that… I’m not terribly familiar with my family’s medical history. We weren’t a terribly close-knit family, you see. I apologize for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: “That’s alright, Mr. Verbos, you’ve given me a good amount of information. Now, just a couple of more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it a rather foolish habit. My wife… she tried it once, many years ago, but didn’t care for it. A rather unpleasant experience, she said. No, I’ve never smoked.
DOCTOR: “Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner from time to time. Nothing excessive, you understand. Perhaps one or two glasses. I wouldn't say I need it, but it helps me relax. Mostly red wine. A Czech Merlot, if I can find it. Other than that, no. I don't drink spirits or beer.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a glass of wine with dinner is fine. Now, one last question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I believe I take something for my… joints. They ache, you see, especially in the mornings. It's a small, yellow pill, I believe. And I take it… as needed. I can't recall the name of it, either. I really ought to make a list, shouldn’t I? I apologize for the inconvenience. My memory is simply… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “No inconvenience at all, Mr. Verbos. It’s very common to have trouble remembering medication names. Okay, let's do a quick exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed at your convenience. I’ll do my best to remain still. It's just… sometimes my joints ache, you see, so I might shift a little.
DOCTOR: “Of course, no worries at all. I'll be gentle. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first.” “Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.” “Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your bladder feels full, which is consistent with your frequent urination. I’m also noting a slightly enlarged prostate. It’s common at your age, but we’ll want to investigate further.”
PATIENT: Oh. An enlarged prostate, you say? Goodness. Is that… serious, Doctor? I must confess, I hadn’t a clue. It’s… disconcerting to hear. I suppose I should have mentioned it to my previous physician, but… well, things slip one’s mind, you know? What does this mean, Doctor? Will I need… treatment?
DOCTOR: “It’s alright, Mr. Verbos. An enlarged prostate, also known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – frequent urination, urgency, and difficulty emptying your bladder. It's good you're letting me know about this now. It explains a lot. We need to do a few things to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection and other issues. We'll also do a PSA blood test to screen for prostate cancer. And finally, I'd like to do a simple test called a flow rate, where you urinate into a container while we measure how quickly the urine comes out. These tests will help us determine the best course of action. We have several options for treatment, depending on the severity of the BPH. These include medication to shrink the prostate or relax the muscles, or in some cases, a minor procedure to improve urine flow. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Goodness. That… is a lot of information to take in. Urine test, PSA blood test, flow rate… It sounds… thorough, I suppose. And a little daunting, if I’m being honest. Prostate cancer… that’s a rather frightening thought. But you’re right, Doctor. It’s best to be thorough. And I trust your judgment completely. Yes, please, proceed with the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. And I hope it doesn’t require… unpleasant procedures.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Mr. Verbos. It’s natural to be anxious, but remember, many men have BPH and live full, healthy lives. The PSA test is just a screening tool – it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer. We’ll discuss the results carefully and explain everything to you. Alright, let's get those tests ordered. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood and give you a container for the urine sample. The flow rate test we can do here in the office after you’ve had a chance to drink a bit of water. In the meantime, try to drink about eight glasses of water a day, and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate your bladder. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Eight glasses of water… yes, I can manage that. And avoid caffeine and alcohol… a small sacrifice, I suppose. Hmm. Let me think… Yes, actually. You mentioned medication to shrink the prostate… Does that have any… side effects? I’ve heard stories, you see. About… difficulties with… well, with intimacy. Is that a common occurrence? I apologize for asking such a… personal question. It’s just… it’s important to me.
DOCTOR: “That’s a very valid question, Mr. Verbos, and a common concern. Yes, some medications used to treat BPH can have side effects, including sexual dysfunction. However, not everyone experiences them, and there are different medications available with varying side effect profiles. We can discuss these options carefully and choose one that is least likely to cause problems for you. There are also other treatments available – like minimally invasive procedures – that don’t have the same side effects. It’s important to be open and honest about your concerns, and we’ll work together to find the best solution for you. I'll be sure to give you a detailed information sheet about each medication option, including its potential side effects, before we make any decisions. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that answers my main concerns for the moment, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose I should let the nurse come in and draw my blood then? And I’ll try to drink as much water as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Yes, let me call the nurse in to draw your blood. She’ll explain everything to you. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’ll get these tests done, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan together. “Now, let’s get you started. The nurse will be in shortly.”
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Verbos. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. Bula!” .
