DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I am Dr. Blim. I see you’re seventy-one years of age. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-one. Feels older some days, haha. Well, it’s my legs, you see. I have these… bumps. Red ones. On my shins, mostly. They hurt, too, a little. Not awful, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: “Bumps,” you say. And on your shins. Right. Well, “bumps” could be a great many things. How long have these “bumps” been present, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Maybe… a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and then more kept showing up. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I bumped into something, but they just… stayed. And got a little more red.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. And they’ve increased in number. Very well. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these… lesions?
PATIENT: Lesions? Oh, you mean the bumps. No, not really. No fever, no feeling sick. Just… the bumps. And the little bit of pain when I press on them. Sometimes they itch a little, but not always. My wife keeps asking if I’ve been working too hard in the garden, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gives me for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I think it's… lisinopril? Something like that. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the wife makes sure of that. She says I need it, especially since I don’t get out in the sun much anymore.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. And a vitamin D supplement. Any allergies to medications, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor gave me. I used to get a little itchy when I was a kid from some plants in the Philippines, but that was a long time ago. Nothing here, though.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look at these “bumps,” shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good, Doctor. Here, you can see them right here, on my shin. And a few more on this one too. They don't look like much, I know, but they bother me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. They are erythematous and slightly raised. No warmth to the touch, no drainage. Approximately 2-5 millimeters in diameter. Distributed primarily along the anterior shins. Now, have you experienced any recent travel, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Recent travel? No, Doctor. Not at all. Haven't left the state in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years? We used to go to California to visit family, but that was before… well, before things got harder. We just stay put now. Mostly around here.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I think. Bad knees. And my father, he had high blood pressure too, like me. Nothing else that I can think of. We didn't really talk much about health problems back in the Philippines, you know? It wasn't something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Social history, Mr. Aluia. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn't like it. Makes me cough just thinking about it. My wife doesn't allow it anyway!
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. Maybe a glass or two a few times a week. Nothing heavy. Mostly red wine. My wife likes it, so I have some too. It’s good for the heart, they say!
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on your history, and a cursory physical examination, it appears you may be experiencing stasis dermatitis. It’s quite common in individuals with venous insufficiency. I recommend you elevate your legs whenever possible and apply a topical corticosteroid cream twice daily. We can get that sent to your pharmacy. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Stasis dermatitis? Venous… what now? Does that mean my legs are bad? The cream… will that help the pain? I don't understand… is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It means there's reduced circulation in your legs. The cream will help with the inflammation and discomfort. It’s not immediately serious, but it can become problematic if left untreated. We will monitor it. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy and schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess your progress. Any further questions or concerns, you can contact the office. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Okay… reduced circulation. I see. So, lifting my legs and putting cream on them. That sounds alright, I guess. A month… that seems a little far away, but okay. No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you for looking at my legs. I appreciate it. Will the Medicare cover the cream, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover it, provided you meet your deductible. The office will verify your coverage. Very well. I have several other patients waiting. Have a good day, Mr. Aluia.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. You too. Have a good day. .
