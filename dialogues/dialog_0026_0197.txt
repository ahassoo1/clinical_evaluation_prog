DOCTOR: Good morning, San. Welcome to San SCIARROTTA. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, to be quick about it, I need a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. Or a taxi. Something like that. It’s… complicated, but I need to be able to legally drive people around. I’m San Sciarrotta, by the way. You probably already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, San, I do see your name here. And you’re right, it can be a little complicated navigating those requirements. So, you need a medical certification to drive for ride-sharing services, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That’s it. And I want to make sure I don't run into any trouble with the law. I used to work with logging equipment, you know? Big machines. I’m very careful, but… better safe than sorry, right? I just need the card. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, San, very sensible of you. It's always best to be proactive. To get you that certification, we'll need to do a basic physical exam to ensure you meet the medical standards for commercial driving. It’s not too extensive, mostly checking your vision, hearing, blood pressure, and a general assessment of your physical condition. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. And my knees ache sometimes, from the logging work. Old injuries, you know? Nothing serious, I don’t take anything for it regularly, just an over-the-counter pain reliever when it flares up. Oh, and I was divorced, a long time ago. Does that matter? I just... want to be thorough, like you said.
DOCTOR: No, the divorce doesn't matter at all, San. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Gallbladder removal ten years ago is good to know, and the knee pain… we’ll certainly take that into account during the exam. Just to clarify, what over-the-counter pain reliever do you usually take when your knees bother you?
PATIENT: Oh, um… usually just ibuprofen. The regular kind. Nothing fancy. And it helps, most of the time. I try not to take it too often, though. I don’t want to rely on it. So, the exam… will it be painful? My knees aren't that bad, but… I don't want to have to bend them too much.
DOCTOR: No, it won't be painful, San. We’ll take it very gently, especially with your knees. We'll assess your range of motion, but I'll make sure it's comfortable for you. We’ll also check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a standard check-up. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And… no, I think that’s everything. I really don't have much else. I feel pretty good for my age, honestly. I just want to be able to drive legally. That’s all. Are we going to do the exam now? I have an appointment later this afternoon, so I'm a little pressed for time.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, that's perfectly fine. We'll get started right away. It shouldn't take too long. If you could just step over to the scale for me, and then we can move to the exam table. We'll start with your height and weight, then proceed with the rest of the physical assessment.
PATIENT: Okay. There. Now what? I haven't been on a scale in ages. Hopefully, it's not too bad. Just get this done quickly, please?
DOCTOR: Alright, San, everything looks good so far. Now, if you could step over to the exam table, we can proceed with the rest of the assessment. Just lie down comfortably, and we'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if it's cold, alright? My circulation isn't what it used to be. Go ahead. And please, don't take too long. I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, just take some nice, deep breaths for me. In and out... good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds that I can detect. Now, let's check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a bit strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. I’m a little nervous. I always get nervous at the doctor. Just be quick, please. My legs aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, San, everything looks good there. Your reflexes are present and symmetrical. Not overly brisk, which is good. Now, let's just take a quick look at your eyes. I'm going to shine a light in each eye. Just follow my light with your eyes. It won't be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Is everything alright? I think my eyesight isn’t as good as it used to be. I wear glasses, you know. Should I have brought them? I didn't think…
DOCTOR: Yes, San, it's good to know you wear glasses. That’s helpful information. It’s a little difficult to assess your vision accurately without them, but your pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. Since you wear glasses, for the most accurate assessment for driving certification, I recommend a full vision test with an optometrist. They will be able to determine if your vision meets the necessary requirements. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, please. That would be very helpful. I didn’t realize I needed that. I just thought… a regular check-up would be enough. Is there anything else? I really need to get going now. My appointment is… soon. And I haven’t even had lunch yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, San. I'm writing up a referral for you now. Based on my brief assessment, you seem generally healthy, but the vision test is essential for the certification. I’ll also recommend a quick blood pressure check with your primary care physician, just to ensure everything is stable. Do you have the name and address of your primary care doctor?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, it’s Dr. Tanaka. He’s over on Elm Street. 123 Elm Street, I think. I haven’t seen him in a while, to be honest. Mostly just try to stay healthy on my own. So, you're saying I can’t get the card until I see an eye doctor and my regular doctor? That’s… inconvenient. But I understand. Just give me the referrals, please.
DOCTOR: Here you are, San. These referrals should get you started. The optometrist will be able to perform the vision test, and Dr. Tanaka can check your blood pressure. Once you have those results, you can submit them with your application for the driving certification. I'll make a note in your chart of our conversation today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it’s… more complicated than I thought. I hope you have a good day. And thank you again.
