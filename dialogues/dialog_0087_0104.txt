DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It's August 2nd, and I see here you're 44 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Yes, 44. It’s… my throat. It hurts. Terribly, actually. I don’t have time for this, to be honest. Just… it hurts when I swallow. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore throat that’s painful with swallowing. I understand you're busy, Ms. Ottaviani, and I'll be as efficient as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me when this sore throat started?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't recall exactly. A few days, maybe? It all feels like a blur these days, to be frank. It's not like it came on suddenly, it just… was. Does it matter? It hurts, and I need it fixed.
DOCTOR: It does matter a little, Ms. Ottaviani, as it helps me narrow down the possibilities. But if you can’t recall precisely, that’s alright. Has anything made it worse since it started?
PATIENT: Worse? Everything makes it worse! Talking, eating… even just breathing feels irritating. It’s a constant ache, Doctor. A constant ache. I work with machines all day, you know. Loud machines. I can't be feeling poorly. It affects my work.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s consistently painful, worsened by most activities. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever… maybe? I haven’t checked. I don’t usually bother with thermometers. And no, no cough, and definitely no runny nose. I’m not one for… ailing. I just have this… discomfort. A very persistent discomfort. Are we getting anywhere, Doctor? Because my lunch break doesn’t last forever.
DOCTOR: We are, Ms. Ottaviani. Alright. Before I do an examination, can you tell me if you’ve been around anyone who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Sick? Goodness. Everyone is always sick. People cough and sniffle all the time. At the factory, especially. Honestly, I try not to pay attention. It's just… part of life. I can’t possibly keep track of who has what. It's really quite ridiculous to ask, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard question, Ms. Ottaviani. I just need to rule out anything contagious. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing, aside from the pain?
PATIENT: Difficulty… no. No difficulty, just… unpleasantness. It’s uncomfortable to swallow, I’ve already told you. It doesn’t feel blocked, if that’s what you mean. Look, I need to get back to work. Is it strep? Can you just give me something for strep? I don’t have time for a lot of… probing.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Ottaviani. However, I can’t simply prescribe medication without determining the cause of your sore throat. Strep throat requires a specific test to confirm, as other things can cause similar symptoms. I'd like to briefly examine your throat, just to get a better understanding. It will only take a moment. Can I take a look?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Just… get it over with. And try not to poke too much. It hurts enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani. Your throat is a little red, but I don’t see any white spots or significant swelling. I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. A little… sensitive, perhaps, but nothing major. Honestly, my whole body feels tired and worn down, Doctor. Working with those machines all day… it takes a toll. It's probably just exhaustion. Can we be done now? I really need to get back to work before my supervisor starts asking questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it doesn't appear to be a severe case of strep throat, but without a test, I can’t rule it out definitively. It’s possible it’s a viral pharyngitis, which we treat symptomatically. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I don't take much in the way of… pills. Never really needed to. Honestly, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. Just a bit… inconvenienced at the moment. So, what does that mean? What are you going to do about it? I’m not going to sit around and feel poorly all week.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your lack of fever and the mild presentation, and since you report no allergies, I recommend a supportive care approach. That includes rest, plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be soothing – and over-the-counter pain relief as needed, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. I’d like you to monitor your symptoms for the next 3-5 days. If you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or if your symptoms worsen significantly, please return immediately, and we'll consider a strep test and other possibilities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reasonable enough, I suppose. Tea and… pills. Fine. As long as I can get back to work. So, no antibiotics? Are you sure? I don't want this to linger. Honestly, I just want it gone. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about it lingering, Ms. Ottaviani. However, antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections, and at this time, it appears more likely to be viral. Taking antibiotics unnecessarily can contribute to antibiotic resistance and won't help with a viral infection. I’m confident with supportive care, you should see improvement within a few days. Here’s a summary of the recommendations. If you need a work excuse note, let me know. Otherwise, you are free to go now. Please do not hesitate to come back if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: A note? No, thank you. I don’t need a note. I’ll just tell them I had a… discomfort. Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Ottaviani. Get well soon. .
