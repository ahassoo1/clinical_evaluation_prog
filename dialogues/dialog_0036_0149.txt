DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dr. Bacy, is it? A pretty name. Well, truthfully, I don’t really want to be here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about… not letting them “do too much.” I don’t recall exactly what she said. It's all a blur these days. I just want to be left alone, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. It sounds like your daughter is concerned about your health, and she’s just wanting to make sure everything is okay. We don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. But sometimes, just checking things out can give us peace of mind. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Oh, she always worries. Always has. A good girl, though. As for what's been going on… well, my feet, mostly. They ache. They just ache. Been aching for… oh, a long time now. It’s just old age, I suppose. Used to be I could dance all night, you know? Now… barely able to get to the mailbox. But it’s nothing a little rest and some good lotion can't fix, I always say. I don't need poking and prodding. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. Aches in your feet, lasting a long time. And you used to be very active, dancing, but now it’s making it difficult even to get the mail. That’s good to know. And you feel rest and lotion are usually enough. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the ache a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, you want a description? Honestly, it’s just… achey. It’s not a sharp pain, not like when I broke my toe, goodness, years ago. It’s just… a dull, throbbing feeling. Especially in the mornings. And after I’ve been on them too long, you know? Standing, walking… just being. It's hard to explain. It just… feels tired. Like they're carrying the weight of the world, those poor feet. Are you writing all this down? I hope so, it’s a bother remembering all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Wynell. You're explaining it perfectly. A dull, throbbing ache, worse in the mornings and after being on your feet, feeling tired… that’s very helpful. And is this ache in both feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I'm glad I'm being helpful. It’s… mostly the left one, I think. Yes, the left. Though the right one does bother me sometimes, especially if I've been foolish and tried to do too much. My daughter keeps telling me to slow down, but what's life for if you don’t enjoy it? She just doesn't understand. Really, it’s the left one that’s the trouble. It just… feels swollen sometimes, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Wynell. Mostly in the left foot, sometimes swelling, and the right foot bothers you occasionally. That’s very good information. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the left foot along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Redness… warmth… Let me think. No, not really. It doesn’t feel warm, no. And I haven't noticed any red, not that I recall. It just… looks like an old woman's foot, I suppose. A bit tired and worn. Everything’s starting to sag these days, not just my feet. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, are you sure poking and prodding is necessary? It all sounds rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: No redness or warmth, just the ache and occasional swelling. And you're right to question if poking and prodding is necessary. We don't have to do anything you don’t want to. Just to be thorough, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that's alright. Then, if you're comfortable, I'd like to take a quick look at your feet. It's a very gentle exam, I promise. First, have you ever had any injuries to your left foot – a sprain, a break, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… let me see. Well, there was that time… oh, decades ago, when I was dancing the rumba. I twisted my ankle something awful. It was swollen for weeks! Had to wear one of those awful support things. But that was… goodness, I don’t even remember when. A long time ago. I've had a few falls, too, lately. But I don't think I broke anything. Just bruises, mostly. Dr. Bacy, are you writing all this down? You're going to have a novel by the time we're done.
DOCTOR: Twisted your ankle while dancing a long time ago, and a few recent falls with bruising. Yes, I am writing everything down. It helps me get a complete picture of what’s going on. Now, do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That's a question. Let me see... My daughter is always going on about my sugar, yes. She says I eat too many sweets. But I don't have diabetes, not that I know of. Arthritis... hmm. My hands ache sometimes, especially in the cold weather. But the doctor said it was just old age again. It's just part of getting older, you know? Everything creaks and groans. I don't take any medicine for it, if that's what you're asking. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, I feel like I'm giving you my life story! Are you sure you need all this information? Perhaps my daughter is exaggerating everything. She does have a tendency to worry…
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Wynell. You're not exaggerating at all. It's good to know your history, and it helps me understand what’s going on. It's good to know your daughter is concerned, and that you sometimes experience aches in your hands. Now, do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh, medications... let me think. Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me years ago. A tiny little pill. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter ones. You know, the kind with the… the sleepy stuff. Melatonin, I think it's called. Honestly, I forget half the time. My daughter keeps track of it all. She’s very organized, bless her heart. I just try to get through the day, you know? Is this really necessary, Dr. Bacy? All these questions? Perhaps I should just go home and put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a medication for your blood pressure and melatonin for sleep occasionally. And your daughter helps you keep track of it. That’s very good to know. Just a few more questions, then we can talk about what we’ve discussed and decide what, if anything, we should do next. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Well, I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl. But that was ages ago! I haven’t been stung in… goodness, decades. And I don’t think I’m allergic to any food. My daughter makes me eat a very healthy diet, actually. Perhaps too healthy! No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, are you nearly finished? All this talk is making my feet ache even more! Perhaps I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you're right, we've covered a lot. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to just take a quick look at your feet. I'll just gently examine them to see if I can get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'll check for swelling, tenderness, and look at the skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, I don't see what good it will do. But... alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, you hear? My feet are very sensitive. And don't expect me to tell you if it hurts. I'm a very stoic woman. Just get it over with. And be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be very gentle. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, even if you consider yourself stoic. Okay. I'm not seeing any significant redness or warmth. There is some mild swelling around the ankle, and it is tender to the touch here, on the inner side of your ankle. Your pulses feel good, though. Any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little… uncomfortable. Yes, there. That feels… tight. Like something is stuck. Not a sharp pain, just… tight. And… oh dear. It's making my whole leg ache now. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, are you sure you know what you're doing? My daughter told me I should have gone to someone else. Someone… younger. Someone who specializes in feet. You’re poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, I apologize if that caused any discomfort. I’ll be more gentle. It sounds like there may be some tightness in your ankle, and we can definitely investigate that further. You are right to ask about specialists, and that’s a very good suggestion. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m feeling in your ankle, it might be best for you to see a podiatrist – a foot specialist. They can do more in-depth evaluation and imaging to determine the exact cause of your pain and recommend the best treatment plan. Would you like me to give you a referral to a podiatrist?
PATIENT: A referral… yes, that sounds… sensible. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, I'm glad you're listening to me. My daughter always says I should advocate for myself. A foot specialist… yes. Someone who specializes in feet. That makes much more sense than you poking around. And… honestly? I think I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. Yes, please. A referral would be lovely. And thank you. For listening, at least.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Wynell. I’m happy I could help. And you are absolutely right to advocate for yourself. It’s important to get the best possible care. Here is the referral information. They have good reviews and are located not too far from here. I’ve also included a little information about what they do. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. That’s very kind of you. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again. For listening, and for the referral. Honestly, Dr. Bacy, you’re a much better doctor than I expected. Tell your daughter I said hello. And… well, that’s all. I think I’ll go put my feet up now. Goodbye, Dr. Bacy.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Wynell. I’m glad I could help. And I will be sure to tell your daughter hello. Please, take care of yourself, and I hope you find relief soon. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and enjoy putting your feet up!
