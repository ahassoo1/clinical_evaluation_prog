DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Schlatterer, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… a rather unpleasant situation, frankly. I’m a teacher, you see. Postsecondary. Library science. And… the students. Honestly. They simply don’t appreciate the… order of things anymore. It’s causing me a great deal of… distress. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have papers to grade, you understand.
DOCTOR: Distress, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, distress. A most… unsettling feeling. A constant… irritation. It’s not… physical, you understand. It’s… mental. A lack of respect, a general… incompetence. Honestly, I’ve never seen such… a decline in standards. And it’s all very tiring.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this isn't related to any particular illness or injury, but more a feeling of… being overwhelmed and frustrated by your students. And it’s causing you mental strain. Is this a recent development, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A “while.” Yes, a considerable while. Decades, perhaps? Though it’s certainly… worsened recently. The new curriculum… simply dreadful. And the students… they expect everything handed to them. No… dedication. No… discipline. It’s… exhausting, truly. I don’t quite recall specifics, you understand. My memory isn't what it used to be. But it’s… persistently unpleasant.
DOCTOR: So, decades of feeling stressed and frustrated… and it’s gotten worse recently with the curriculum change. You mentioned some memory difficulties. Are you experiencing any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well… I find myself… misplacing things. Papers, mostly. Important papers. And I… occasionally forget names. Though, frankly, the names aren’t very memorable to begin with. It’s mostly a general… weariness. A lack of… enthusiasm. Though, enthusiasm is overrated, if you ask me. It’s simply… a bothersome feeling. Is this going to take much longer? I really must get back to my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Misplacing papers, forgetting names… a general weariness. It sounds like we're dealing with some cognitive changes alongside your stress. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh. Yes, well… it’s… fitful. I wake up frequently. Though, I've always been a light sleeper. It's not that I can't sleep, you understand. It's just… not restful. I often find myself… thinking about the students. Even when I’m trying to rest. A rather… irritating habit, if you ask me. Honestly, they fill my mind with… nonsense.
DOCTOR: So, disrupted sleep, frequent awakenings, and you're often thinking about your students even when trying to rest. Okay. And are you experiencing any difficulties with your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Well… it fluctuates. Some days I have no desire to eat at all. Other days… I manage a small portion. It's not a matter of dislike, you understand. It's just… a lack of… inclination. Food seems… rather pointless, if I'm being perfectly honest. Though, I suppose one must eat something. It's simply… not a priority.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fluctuating appetite, with a general lack of inclination to eat. Have you noticed any changes in your weight, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh… goodness. Yes, well… I suspect I’ve… diminished somewhat. My clothes feel… rather loose. Though, I haven’t… actively weighed myself recently. I simply haven't the… energy for such trivialities. It’s likely negligible, you understand. A few pounds, perhaps. It's all rather… bothersome, if I’m being perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. We've covered a fair amount. You're experiencing chronic stress and frustration, cognitive changes like memory lapses and misplacing things, disrupted sleep, fluctuating appetite, and some weight loss. Given your age, and these symptoms… I'm concerned about the possibility of mild cognitive impairment, possibly related to underlying anxiety or depression. However, it’s too early to say definitively. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other medical causes. And I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment here in the office. It’s just a few simple questions, to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work? And… questions? Honestly. It all seems rather… excessive. I came here because I was stressed, not because I was… deficient in something. However… if it will expedite matters… I suppose. But I must warn you, I haven’t a great deal of patience for… trivialities. I simply want to return to my work as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll keep it brief. The blood work will check for things like vitamin B12, thyroid function, and basic metabolic panel. It's standard procedure. And the cognitive assessment will take about fifteen minutes. It's not a diagnosis, just a way to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function. The lab is just down the hall. After that, we'll come back here, and I'll administer the assessment. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather… robust, constitutionally. Though, I do find the smell of lilies… distasteful. But that’s hardly an allergy. Honestly, I’d prefer to simply be finished with this entire affair. Is there no quicker way? I have papers to grade, you know.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mr. Schlatterer, a proper assessment requires these steps. We need to rule out any underlying medical causes before we can determine the best course of action. Let’s start with the blood work. The nurse will be right with you. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we’ll return here, and I'll administer the cognitive assessment. Just follow me.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. But I must insist on a swift and efficient procedure. I haven’t all day, you understand. And I expect a clear explanation of any… findings. I abhor ambiguity. Lead on, then. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Right this way. The nurse, Maria, is very efficient. She’ll take excellent care of you. And I assure you, I will provide a clear explanation of everything. Maria, this is Mr. Schlatterer. He’s here for some routine blood work.
PATIENT: Routine, you say? Honestly. I haven’t the faintest idea what is “routine” about this entire ordeal. I simply hope it won’t take too long. My time is… valuable.
