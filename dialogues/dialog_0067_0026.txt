DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pfennig, was it? It's...something about being awfully tired. Just awfully tired, really. And the young man at the lab said something about my...numbers being off. Creatine...something? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It’s just tiring, being old, you know. Things just go.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, Dr. Pfennig is correct. It is tiring, being old, as you say. And it's perfectly alright that you don’t keep track of numbers – that’s what I’m here for. The lab results did show some changes, specifically with your creatinine levels, which can tell us about how well your kidneys are functioning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Kidneys, you say? Well, I suppose everything's slowing down. Everything always does, eventually. As for the tiredness… it’s just… all the time. Not like after a long day, though. It's more like… wading through mud. Even after a full night's sleep, which isn't always easy these days, I just feel… drained. And I can't do as much around the house anymore. My husband, bless him, has to pick up the slack. He used to be a strong man, a diver, you know… but he’s getting on too. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Wading through mud” is a very helpful way to describe it. And it's good to know it’s not just after a long day, that it persists even with sleep. It’s also important to me that your husband is also aging. We need to consider both of you. To clarify, has this tiredness come on suddenly, or has it been a gradual process?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I suppose. It didn’t just happen overnight. It’s been… creeping up on me for… well, I couldn’t say exactly when. Months, probably. A long time. I used to be very active, you know. Always busy. And now… it's like each day chips away a little bit more energy. I don’t even have the energy to properly tend to my garden anymore, and I love my garden. It’s… depressing, if I’m honest. But what good does complaining do?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be honest, Ardelle. It’s not complaining, it’s important information. And it sounds like this is impacting your quality of life, which is something we definitely want to address. Now, beyond the tiredness and the difficulty with your garden, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My muscles ache sometimes. Not all the time, but… a dull ache, especially after I’ve been sitting for a while. And I’ve been feeling a bit… clumsy, I suppose. Dropped a few things lately. Nothing major, just… not as steady on my feet. My appetite hasn’t been great either, though I still enjoy a good cup of tea. And...oh, my ankles swell up sometimes. Especially in the evenings. Does that count? I do have rather bad circulation, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, that absolutely counts. The muscle aches, clumsiness, decreased appetite, and ankle swelling are all important pieces of the puzzle. The fact that your ankles swell in the evenings, and you have a history of bad circulation, is particularly helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see... High blood pressure, yes. Doctor gave me a little pill for that, years ago. I take it every morning, I think. Sometimes I forget, but mostly I remember. And… something with my heart, a long time ago. They said it wasn’t serious, just a…fluttering, I think? I had to take some medication for a while, but they took me off it eventually. Honestly, I don't remember all the details. Old age, you know. It steals your memory. And… I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Is that important? I mostly just remember the pain afterward. A dreadful pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, the high blood pressure and the history of a heart flutter are important. And having your gallbladder removed is good to know as well. Thank you for remembering those details, even if it's difficult. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Just the one for my blood pressure, I believe. Though, sometimes my neighbor gives me her leftover pain pills when her arthritis is acting up. Just for a bad night, you understand. Nothing regularly. And...oh, I take a vitamin D supplement. Doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. That's about it, I think. Honestly, I try to avoid taking too many pills. They just make me feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, occasional pain pills from your neighbor, and a vitamin D supplement. It's good to know about the pain pills, even if they’re occasional – we need to have a complete picture of everything you're taking. And I understand your reluctance to take too many medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. Though, sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy after I use certain soaps. But that's hardly an allergy, is it? And… I think I sneezed a lot when I was around cats as a child, but I haven't been near a cat in decades. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy old woman. It’s just this tiredness that’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ardelle. No known drug allergies and just mild skin sensitivity. It sounds like you’ve been quite resilient over the years. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, kidney problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a difficult one. My parents are both gone now, and I didn't keep track of their illnesses, I’m afraid. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She tired easily, much like myself. And my father… he had some kind of trouble with his legs. Swelling, I think. But honestly, I was very young when they passed, and I didn't pay much attention to their medical problems. It's just… old age, mostly, I suppose. It runs in the family. Everyone just… slows down eventually. It’s not something we talked about much. It just is.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have detailed family history information. It sounds like there may have been a history of heart and leg problems, which is helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I don’t do much these days, if I’m honest. I used to be very active, always busy around the house, tending to my garden. But now… I mostly sit. Read a bit, watch television, have tea with my neighbor. My husband does most of the heavy lifting. We eat regular meals, mostly simple foods. Nothing fancy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I don't exercise, no. My husband used to take me for walks, but… I tire too easily now. It’s just… a quiet life, mostly. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. That gives me a good picture of your current lifestyle. Okay, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I don't mind. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… don't take too long, dear. I get tired easily, you know. It’s just… tiring, being old. Is there a comfortable chair? I don’t think I can stand for very long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. Absolutely. We'll take it slow and gentle, and you can sit the entire time. There's a comfortable chair right over there. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Sounds a bit faint, but regular rhythm. I’m also noting some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148/86, pulse is 72 and regular. I’d also like to feel your abdomen and check for any tenderness or swelling. Mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no significant swelling. And finally, I’m going to check your ankles for swelling and assess your reflexes. Significant 2+ pitting edema in both ankles, and diminished reflexes. Alright, that’s all for now. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, and the lab results, your tiredness, muscle aches, ankle swelling, and changes in appetite are concerning. The crackles in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles suggest some fluid retention, and the lab results do indicate some kidney issues. We will need to investigate the kidney problem further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Kidney issues? Fluid retention? I just want to feel better, Doctor. I don’t want to end up bedridden, you understand. My husband… he wouldn’t be able to manage. What does this mean? What are we going to do? Is it something awful? I feel a bit faint now. Are you sure it’s not just… old age? Perhaps I just need a good rest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious, Ardelle. It’s not necessarily “something awful,” but it does require attention. The changes in your kidneys can contribute to the tiredness, swelling, and other symptoms you’ve been experiencing. The fluid retention is something we need to address. It's not simply old age, although age is a factor. Your symptoms are beyond what we would typically expect with normal aging. We need to run some additional tests to understand the extent of the kidney issues and identify the cause. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. These tests will give us a more detailed picture of your kidney function and overall health. I’m also going to order an EKG to assess your heart and rule out any underlying heart problems. I’m also going to prescribe a diuretic, a medication that will help your body get rid of excess fluid. This should help with the swelling in your ankles and make you feel more comfortable. It’s important to take this medication as prescribed, and we’ll monitor your kidney function closely. Would you be comfortable with me consulting with a nephrologist, a kidney specialist?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? A specialist? It all sounds… overwhelming. A nephrologist? Is it serious enough for a specialist? I just want a simple answer, Doctor. Is it something I can fix? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to be a burden to my husband, you understand. He’s getting on in years too. A diuretic… is that a strong pill? Will it make me feel worse? I don't want to feel more tired. I don’t even know what a comprehensive metabolic panel is. Perhaps… perhaps it is just old age. Maybe I should just rest more. I don’t want to put my husband through all this trouble. He worries so much. But...if it will help, then I suppose I can try the pill. But please, Doctor, explain everything to me. Slowly. And don't use any big words.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Ardelle, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. Let’s take it one step at a time. A comprehensive metabolic panel is just a blood test that looks at different levels in your blood – things like electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. It’s a routine test that helps us get a better understanding of your overall health. And a nephrologist is a doctor who specializes in kidney problems. I want to get their opinion to make sure we’re doing everything we can to address your concerns. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s always best to have a specialist involved when there are kidney issues. The diuretic is a medication that helps your kidneys get rid of extra fluid, which will help with the swelling in your ankles and make you feel less tired. It’s a relatively mild medication, but it does have some side effects, like increased urination. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor you closely to make sure it’s not causing any problems. I understand your concern about being a burden to your husband, and we’ll do everything we can to make this as easy as possible for both of you. We’ll schedule the tests at your convenience, and I’ll explain everything to him as well. We will be doing these tests as an outpatient, meaning you won't need to stay at the hospital. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and starting the diuretic. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. One week… I suppose I can manage that. But please, no more big words. And explain everything to my husband too. He worries so much. He used to be a very strong man, a diver you know, but he’s getting on in years now. He needs to understand what’s going on. And… what about the pain pills? Is it alright to continue taking those occasionally? My neighbor… she has arthritis, you know. They help me sleep sometimes. I don’t want to become dependent on them, but they do provide some relief. And… will this pill affect my tea? I enjoy a good cup of tea, you understand. It’s one of the few pleasures I have left.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. We will explain everything to your husband. It’s important he understands what’s going on, and I’m happy to answer any questions he may have. Regarding the pain pills, it's best to avoid taking them if possible, even occasionally. They can interact with other medications and can have side effects, especially as you get older. We can discuss alternative ways to manage your pain, such as physical therapy or gentle exercises. And don’t worry about your tea! The diuretic shouldn’t affect your ability to enjoy a good cup of tea. However, it may cause you to urinate more frequently, so you might need to plan bathroom breaks accordingly. It’s also important to stay hydrated, so you should continue drinking plenty of fluids throughout the day. Let me write down the name of the diuretic and instructions for taking it. It’s called Furosemide, and you’ll take 20 milligrams once a day in the morning. I’m also going to schedule a blood test and a urine sample for next week. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Furosemide… that’s a mouthful. And 20 milligrams… is that a lot? It all sounds… complicated. I’m afraid I’m not very good with numbers, you know. And what about driving? Will this pill make me dizzy? I like to drive to the shops sometimes, and I don’t want to risk an accident. And… will it affect my appetite? I haven't been feeling very hungry lately, and I don't want to lose any more weight. And...will I have to see a specialist right away? Because my husband, he gets very anxious at hospitals. It's just...a lot.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask all these questions, Ardelle. It is a lot to take in, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. 20 milligrams is a standard starting dose of Furosemide, and it’s usually well-tolerated. We’ll monitor you closely for any side effects, and we can adjust the dose if necessary. Regarding driving, Furosemide can sometimes cause dizziness, especially when you first start taking it. It’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how the medication affects you. We can discuss alternative transportation options if necessary. As for your appetite, Furosemide can sometimes cause a temporary decrease in appetite. However, this is usually mild and goes away on its own. We’ll monitor your weight closely and discuss ways to maintain a healthy diet if necessary. Regarding the specialist, you don’t need to see the nephrologist right away. We’ll wait to see the results of your blood tests and urine sample first. If the results are concerning, then we’ll schedule an appointment with the nephrologist. Your husband doesn't need to come to the appointment if he is too anxious. We can discuss the results over the phone, or I can arrange a video conference if necessary. Let me give you the number for the lab and the number for my office. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. And remember, we’re taking it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. You've been very patient with me. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t want to forget anything important. And… is it alright if I bring my neighbor with me to the follow-up appointment? She’s very good at taking notes, and she can help me remember what you say. She understands these things, you know. And… one last question. Will this pill affect my sleep? I’ve been having trouble sleeping lately, and I don’t want to make it any worse. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ardelle. It’s perfectly alright to be worried, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Yes, it’s absolutely fine to bring your neighbor to the follow-up appointment. Having someone there to take notes and help you remember things is a great idea. And yes, Furosemide can sometimes affect sleep. It’s a diuretic, so it can cause you to wake up more often to urinate during the night. If this happens, you can try taking the medication earlier in the day or reducing the dose. We can also discuss other ways to improve your sleep, such as establishing a regular bedtime routine or avoiding caffeine before bed. I’m glad I could help, Ardelle. Remember to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Now, let’s schedule that follow-up appointment. How about next week, same time?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Next week, same time. That will do nicely. Thank you again for your patience. You’ve been very kind. And… please, don't worry about my husband. He'll be alright. He just… worries too much. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowing what to expect. And… one last thing. Do you have any brochures about kidney health? I’d like to read more about it, you know. Just to be prepared. I think… I think that’s all for now. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ardelle. I'm happy I could help ease your worries. Yes, we do have some brochures about kidney health. Here you are. They have some helpful information about kidney function, diet, and lifestyle. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ardelle. Remember to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you're feeling anxious or overwhelmed. Have a good day, and I'll see you next week.
