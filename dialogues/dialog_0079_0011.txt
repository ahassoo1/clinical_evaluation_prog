DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 64 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, sixty-four. Though I don't see what that has to do with anything. I need a… a permission slip, I guess you'd call it. For somethin’ a fella wants to do. A… a fixin’ up, is what it is. Don't rightly remember all the details, but it needs your say-so. Let’s just get this over with, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: A “permission slip,” you say?
PATIENT: That's what the nice lady on the phone called it. Look, I ain't a doctor-type person. I fix towers, not people. This… procedure, it's somethin' I wanna do, and they said I need a doctor to say it's alright. Don't ask me why, I just wanna get it done. Is that so hard to understand? I’m payin’ you, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, simply having a “say-so” isn’t sufficient for a medical procedure. I need to understand what procedure you are referring to, the reason for it, and your overall health status to determine if it's safe and appropriate. Do you recall anything specific about this “fixin’ up”?
PATIENT: Health status? I been climbin’ towers for forty years, my health is just fine! Look, it's… it's about my face. Some wrinkles, that's all. A fella wants to look presentable, alright? Some kinda… smoothin' thing. They showed me pictures. Tiny needles, I think. That's all I remember. Honestly, I don’t see why you need to know all these details. It's my face! Seems pretty straightforward to me. Are you gonna do it or not? I ain't got all day.
DOCTOR: “Smoothin’ thing” with tiny needles… that sounds like cosmetic injections, potentially dermal fillers or Botox. Now, have you had anything like this done before?
PATIENT: Fillers? Botox? Look, I told you, I fix towers, not faces! I don’t know nothin' about fancy names. Maybe? I get a lot of work done, travel all over. Coulda been somethin' like that years ago. Honestly, I don't keep track of such things. It's all a blur. Just tell me if you can do it, Doc. Are you gonna poke me with needles, or am I wastin' my time?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I am a family medicine physician. While I can discuss cosmetic procedures, I do not routinely perform them. And, frankly, given your… lack of recall regarding previous treatments, and the fact that you are uninsured, I am hesitant to proceed without a more thorough assessment. Have you discussed this with anyone else?
PATIENT: Uninsured? What’s that got to do with pokin’ me with a needle? I got cash! Plenty of it! And I ain't tellin' nobody my business, alright? Look, I just want a simple fix. A little smoothin’, a little tightenin’. It's my money, my face, and my time. I ain’t lookin' for a life story, just a signature! Are you gonna do it or are we done here? I got a tower to climb tomorrow, and I need to look respectable. Don't you have somethin' else to do besides grillin’ an old man about his wrinkles?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, while I appreciate your… directness, I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure any procedure I authorize is safe and appropriate for your health. The fact that you are uninsured complicates matters, as follow-up care, should any complications arise, would be your sole responsibility. Given your limited recall of prior treatments, I need to understand your medical history. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness gracious, I climb towers, Doc! I’m exposed to all sorts of things! Dust, birds, the sun… you name it! I ain’t got time to remember every little sniffle and sneeze I ever had. I ain't allergic to nothin' important. Look, this is gettin’ ridiculous. I just want a little touch-up! Is that too much to ask? I’m payin’ you good money here! Are you gonna poke me with needles or not? I’m startin' to think I should just go somewhere else. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot proceed without a basic understanding of your health status. Given your insistence on proceeding despite these concerns, and your lack of recall, I strongly recommend a consultation with a dermatologist. They are specialists in skin and cosmetic procedures and can provide a more informed opinion. I will not authorize a procedure without a proper assessment of your medical history and potential risks. I'm not willing to compromise your safety for the sake of convenience. I suggest you schedule an appointment with a dermatologist. Do you have any interest in a referral?
