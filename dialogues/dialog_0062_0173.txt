DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too! Well, I've been having these chills, and they're kind of bothering me. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a few days. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. They just… come and go. Not constantly, you know? Like, I'll be perfectly fine, then suddenly I feel really cold, even if it's warm in here. And then it passes. It's not like a fever chill, where you're shaking uncontrollably. It's more… subtle, I guess? Like a shiver running through me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent chills, not accompanied by shaking or a high fever. That's helpful. Are you having any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: Let's see... I've been a little tired, maybe more than usual. But honestly, I'm always a bit tired. And, now that I think about it, my muscles feel a little achy, but it’s hard to say if that's just from… life, you know? I do a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and muscle aches along with the chills. And you do a fair amount of walking, which could certainly contribute to muscle soreness. Have you noticed any cough, sore throat, runny nose, or any digestive issues like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No cough, no sore throat, my nose is fine. And my stomach's been okay, thankfully. No nausea or anything. Just the chills and feeling a bit worn out. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it, I've been a little more thirsty than usual, but I thought that was just the weather. It's been pretty hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, sore throat, digestive issues. Increased thirst, which you attribute to the heat. That's good information. Have you had any recent changes in your appetite, or have you noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No, my appetite’s been normal, I think. I haven’t really been keeping track, but I'm eating like usual. And no weight loss, definitely not. If anything... maybe a little gain recently, but that's probably just from comfort food when I'm tired. It's been a stressful few months since the divorce, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant change in appetite or weight. And you've been dealing with a stressful divorce recently. That's important to know. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, strep throat – but nothing major. No ongoing conditions or anything like that. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I do have private insurance, so I get regular check-ups, and everything’s always been fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No chronic medical conditions, and you have regular check-ups with your private insurance. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and thankfully, I've never been hospitalized. Nothing like that. I try to stay out of hospitals if I can! I really pride myself on taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And you prioritize your health, which is great. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some heart problems when he was older, but that was pretty late in life. And my grandmother, on my mom’s side, had arthritis, I think. Honestly, I don’t really know much beyond that. My family isn’t really big on talking about medical stuff, you know? It's a bit of a taboo subject.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of high blood pressure, heart problems, and arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I tried it once in college, and it wasn't for me. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week, but I don’t drink heavily. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I'm not really into all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics before, and I’m fine with those. No food allergies either, I can eat pretty much anything. Nope, I think I'm good. Nothing comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take your blood pressure. Then I’ll take a look at your throat and feel your neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your blood pressure is 128/82, also within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your throat looks fine, no redness or swelling. I did notice some slight tenderness when I palpated your neck, specifically on the left side. It's subtle, but it’s there. Now, I'd like to order some blood work just to rule out any underlying infections or other potential causes for your symptoms. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, I'm going to document everything we discussed today and go over some possible causes for your symptoms. Based on what you've told me—the intermittent chills, fatigue, slight muscle aches, tenderness in your neck, and the absence of other typical symptoms—it could be a few things. It could be a mild viral infection, even though you don’t have a cough or sore throat. Sometimes those can present atypically. It could also be related to stress, especially considering the recent divorce. And we'll rule out thyroid issues with the blood work. I want to be thorough, so we’re doing the blood work. Once we have the results, we can discuss a specific treatment plan, if needed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense. I appreciate you being so thorough. Stress… yeah, that's definitely been a big factor. It's just… frustrating to feel this way all the time. So, it’s mostly just waiting for the results then? And if it is the stress, is there anything I can do in the meantime, besides just… trying to relax?
DOCTOR: Yes, mostly waiting for the results. And you're right to ask about what you can do in the meantime. While we wait, focusing on stress management techniques could be very helpful. Things like regular exercise – even a short walk can make a difference – mindfulness or meditation, and making sure you're getting enough sleep. Connecting with friends and family for support is also important. I'm going to give you a handout with some resources for stress management techniques. It includes websites and apps that you might find helpful. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed, please don’t hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional. I can provide a referral if you'd like. I'll also write a note for you to follow up in a week, or sooner if you feel worse. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds wonderful, thank you. The handout would be great, and I might actually take you up on that referral. It’s just… a lot. Thank you for listening, Dr. DeCosta. It really helps to just talk it through with someone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. It’s my job, and I’m glad I could help. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as taking care of your physical health. The lab technician should be here any moment. I'll have the results sent to me, and we'll go over them next week. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. DeCosta. You’ve been very kind. I'll see you next week then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you next week.
