DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, my memory has been troubling me. It is not good. I want to find out what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Memory troubles, you say. I understand wanting to get to the bottom of things promptly. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "not good"?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to explain. Things I should remember… names, where I put things, what I ate for breakfast… these things… they are not gone, but… they are slow to come. Like a fog. And sometimes… I repeat myself, I think. My daughter noticed. She is very observant. It started, I believe, maybe six months ago? Around the time my blood pressure became… higher. The doctor before… he just gave me pills.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, and coinciding with a change in blood pressure… that’s helpful. So, it's not a sudden change, more of a gradual slowing, and difficulty recalling things – names, recent events, things like that. You mentioned repeating yourself… can you give me an example of that?
PATIENT: Yes. Just this morning, I asked my daughter, twice, if she had taken the trash out. She had already done it, before I even woke up. And… yesterday, I was telling a friend about a trip to the market, and I repeated the same story three times, I think. I felt very foolish. It is… embarrassing. And it is worrying. I do not want to… lose my mind. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Alvara. It's definitely concerning when you notice changes in your memory. Repeating yourself, as you describe, is something we need to explore. Losing your mind, as you put it, is a strong phrase, and we’ll work to figure out what’s happening. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Besides the repeating, are you having trouble with other things?
PATIENT: Other things… hmm. Sometimes, I forget appointments. I write them down, but then I do not see them. Or… I will go into a room to get something, and then I forget why I went in there. Small things, mostly. Nothing… dramatic. But they are becoming more frequent. And… I used to be very good with numbers, for my work. Now, I have to double-check everything. It slows me down. It is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so forgetfulness with appointments, losing your train of thought… difficulty with tasks you used to find easy, like numbers. That all sounds… consistent. And you mentioned you used to be good with numbers for work. What kind of work did you do, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: I am a property manager. Real estate. And I manage the community association for my building. It involves a lot of finances. Budgets, invoices, paying bills… before, it was simple. Now, I need my daughter to help me. She is very good with accounting. But I do not want to… rely on her forever. I like to be independent. It is important to me.
DOCTOR: Property management, finances… that requires a lot of mental focus, and good organizational skills. And it's understandable you want to maintain your independence. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I have arthritis in my knees, but it is manageable with medication. And… I had a bout of pneumonia last year, but I recovered fully. Besides that… no. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables and fish. I walk every day, when the weather permits. I try to stay active. But… my blood pressure has been a problem for some time now. It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, pneumonia last year, otherwise healthy lifestyle… and a family history of high blood pressure. That’s helpful. Do you know what your most recent blood pressure reading was?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it was 150 over 90. The last time the nurse checked it, before giving me the refill for the pills. She seemed concerned. She said it was… elevated. I do not know what that means exactly, but it did not sound good. I do not like taking so many pills. They make me feel… sluggish. And I worry about the side effects.
DOCTOR: 150 over 90 is elevated, Ms. Alvara. And I understand your concern about taking pills and the side effects. We’ll certainly consider all your options. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure medication, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the arthritis medication, naproxen. And sometimes, I take something for sleep, if I cannot get to sleep. It is… a mild sleeping pill. My daughter bought it for me. She said I was not getting enough rest. I do not take it every night, only when I am very anxious. I believe it is… lorazepam. Is that right? I am not very good with the names of things anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so naproxen for arthritis, and lorazepam as needed for sleep. That’s important to know. And you said you only take the lorazepam when you’re anxious?
PATIENT: Yes. Not every night. Maybe… once or twice a week, if I am very stressed. Work is… demanding. The community association… there is always someone complaining. And I worry about the finances. It is a lot of responsibility. My daughter says I need to relax more, but it is difficult. I like to be in control. It is just… sometimes, I cannot sleep because my mind is racing. Then, I take the pill. A small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your overall health. We’ll check your blood pressure again, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment – just to test your reflexes and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I want to find out what is happening. Quickly, if possible. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Still elevated, unfortunately. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple tests – just to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. This is easy enough. I used to be very good at these things. My daughter says I still have good reflexes.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you follow my instructions and touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger with your finger, and repeat?
PATIENT: Yes. Like this? Is that correct? I am a little… unsteady on my feet today. The floor feels… sloped.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. And it’s alright that you’re a little unsteady – sometimes it just happens. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Just a normal walk, if you can.
PATIENT: This is… difficult. I do not usually walk like this. The floor… it is uneven, I think. Or maybe it is just me. I feel… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara, let’s sit back down. It’s alright. You're a little unsteady, and that’s something we need to investigate. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility is that the lorazepam, while helpful for sleep, could be contributing to some of the memory and balance issues. Long-term use can sometimes have those effects. Another possibility, given your elevated blood pressure and family history, is that you may be experiencing some cognitive impairment related to vascular issues. We need to rule out other causes, too. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and to rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of your brain, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I agree to them. The MRI… is that painful? I do not like enclosed spaces. But… I want to know what is happening. And if the pills are the problem, I want to stop taking them. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: The MRI isn’t painful, Ms. Alvara, but I understand your concern about enclosed spaces. You'll be lying flat, and it can be a bit loud, but you'll have headphones to wear. And we can discuss options for managing any anxiety you may have – perhaps a mild sedative before the scan. We'll start with the blood tests today. The nurse will draw some samples. And then we'll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible. I'll also write you a prescription for a lower dose of the lorazepam, and we’ll see how you do with that. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a log of your symptoms – when you experience memory problems, or if you feel unsteady. That will help us track your progress. And please, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. That is… a lot of information. The tests, the lower dose… the log. I will try to remember everything. And if I feel worse… I will contact you. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I just want to… feel like myself again. Quickly, if possible. .
