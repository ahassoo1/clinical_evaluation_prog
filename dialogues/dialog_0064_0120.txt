DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have time for small talk, Doctor. I just… want to make sure any future pregnancies I have go smoothly. My husband… well, he passed, and I want to be sure everything’s alright before I even think about trying for another one. You know? Don't want any complications.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carmaleta. That’s a very sensible thing to do, and I’m glad you’re thinking ahead. It's good to be prepared. And I’m very sorry for your loss… losing a husband is a tremendous hardship. To help me understand what kind of preparation we need to do, could you tell me a little bit about your previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Ugh, previous pregnancies. Honestly? It was… a long time ago. And frankly, not something I dwell on. I had… two. Both fine, I suppose. Normal births. No major problems, if I remember correctly. Look, I was young, things happen, you know? It wasn’t exactly… difficult, if that’s what you’re asking. I just… want to make sure the next one is easy too. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Carmaleta. And it's perfectly understandable that you don't dwell on the details – it sounds like they weren’t overly complicated, which is good. Just to be thorough, and since some things can change over time, could you remind me roughly when those pregnancies were?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I don’t really keep track of dates. It was… a while ago. Maybe… early 2000s? Before and after? Look, I was busy raising them, not making a calendar of when I got pregnant! Is this really important? Because if it’s just… general info, I’m not the best person to ask. I’m more concerned about future complications, not rehashing the past.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Don’t worry about precise dates. It looks like I have some records here indicating your first pregnancy was in 2002 and your second in 2006. That helps give me a timeline. Now, just to get a clearer picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you have – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Let me see. I had… something with my blood pressure once? A little high, I think. But it went down with diet. I don't take anything for it now. And my sister had thyroid issues, does that count? Look, I’m generally healthy. I eat my vegetables. I walk. I'm not one of those people who’s always at the doctor's office complaining about everything. Honestly, this whole thing is starting to feel like a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. We just want to be sure we have all the necessary information. It’s good that your blood pressure came down with diet, that’s excellent. And family history is important, so thank you for mentioning your sister. Just to clarify, when you say your blood pressure was a little high, do you remember if a doctor ever gave you a specific diagnosis, like hypertension, or pre-hypertension?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, no. I don't remember diagnoses. I remember a doctor saying something about numbers being a bit off and telling me to cut back on salt. That's it! I did it. It went down. I don’t need a medical degree to remember that! Can we please just talk about things I can do to have a healthy pregnancy, instead of grilling me about things that happened twenty years ago? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Carmaleta. My apologies. We should be focusing on the future. It sounds like you managed your blood pressure very effectively on your own, and that’s wonderful. I'm just trying to rule things out. Let’s talk about what you want to do to prepare for a healthy pregnancy. To start, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat well. I'm a sensible person. I don't just pop pills for everything. Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m wasting my time here. You’re asking me about things I don’t take, instead of what I can do. This isn't helpful. Are you going to give me advice or just interrogate me?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to call me out on that, Carmaleta. I apologize. I’m getting caught up in collecting information and not focusing enough on what you need. Let's absolutely talk about what you can do. Before we get to specifics, and to give me a better idea of what's best for you, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Look, I haven’t even said I’m trying to get pregnant yet! And I'm perfectly healthy. I don’t need poking and prodding. I just want to know if there’s anything I should be worried about, maybe a special vitamin to take. Not a full workup. Honestly, this is just… unnecessary. I think I'm done. I’m wasting my time here. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. You’re right, it’s your decision. It sounds like you're generally very health-conscious, and if you'd prefer not to have a full exam, I respect that. In that case, let me recommend a few things. Starting a prenatal vitamin with folic acid is always a good idea when planning a pregnancy. It really helps with preventing neural tube defects. And if you haven’t had one recently, a basic blood test to check your iron levels would be helpful. If you decide you'd like a more thorough assessment, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. I wish you all the best, and thank you for coming in today.
