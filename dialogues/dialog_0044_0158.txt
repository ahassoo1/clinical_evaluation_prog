DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Asami, was it? Yes, right. Well, it’s about… a letter. A pet letter. My daughter, she’s moving, you see, and the landlord… he wants a letter saying I'm a responsible pet owner. Honestly, the nerve! But she says I need one, so here I am. It’s all a bit silly, really.
DOCTOR: A pet letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! A pet letter. For a dog. A perfectly lovely, well-behaved dog, might I add. Though, honestly, landlords these days… They want everything in writing. It’s just… paperwork. A lot of paperwork for something that’s just common sense. I've had pets before, you know. Responsible pets. It's not like I've never cared for an animal. But proving it… that’s the difficult part. Do you… do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand. Documentation for responsible pet ownership isn’t something we typically deal with here, but I can certainly see how it’s become necessary. It's good your daughter is being proactive. So, to help me write this letter for you, could you tell me a little more about your dog?
PATIENT: Oh, the dog. Right. Well, her name is… Let me think now. It’s… Precious. Yes, Precious. She’s a small one. A little fluffy thing, a Shih Tzu, I think? Or maybe a Lhasa Apso. Honestly, they all look the same to me. She’s… white. Very white. And she doesn't shed much, which is a blessing. My daughter got her… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember when. A few years ago, anyway. She's a good girl, mostly. Doesn’t cause any trouble. Though she does bark at the mailman sometimes. It’s just a little yap, really. But I try to keep her quiet. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Precious, a lovely name! And a fluffy white Shih Tzu or Lhasa Apso… they are sweet dogs. It’s good she doesn’t shed much – that can be a real concern for some people. And a little bark at the mailman is perfectly normal, I wouldn’t worry too much about that. Now, have you had any other pets before Precious?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty. When I was younger, I had a parrot. A beautiful African Grey. Very intelligent bird, could say all sorts of things. Though, honestly, it was a bit too much work. Too much cleaning. And then, there was a cat, a tabby. A lovely cat, very affectionate. But it… it ran away, sadly. Years ago now. And before that… oh, goodness, I had goldfish! Lots of goldfish. But they… well, they don’t live very long, do they? So, I don’t really count those. It's been a while, honestly. But I always had animals, yes. Responsible animals. I always took good care of them. I think.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been a pet owner for quite some time, and a caring one at that. A parrot, a cat, and even goldfish – you’ve certainly had a variety of companions. Knowing that history is helpful. Now, to make sure this letter is as thorough as possible, could you tell me if Precious has been up-to-date on her vaccinations and vet visits?
PATIENT: Oh, vaccinations… now, that’s where my daughter handles everything. She takes Precious to the vet regularly, I know that. She’s very good about those things. I… honestly, I don’t recall the specifics. Dates, and what they give her... it all goes over my head. She sends me pictures, of course. Precious looking very proud after her check-ups. But the details… I'm afraid I wouldn't know. I just know she's a healthy dog. A very healthy dog. Do you think that's enough? Perhaps your records could show something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Deloris. It’s very common for family members to share pet care responsibilities. Let’s see if we can access Precious’s records here at the clinic. It’s possible she’s been seen by a veterinarian who shares information with our network. Unfortunately, I'm not finding any records for Precious under your name or your daughter’s name in our system. Do you happen to know the name of the veterinary clinic your daughter uses?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… not good, is it? No, I don’t. She lives in another town, you see, and she handles all of that. She just tells me Precious is well looked after. Honestly, I don't even know where to begin looking. It’s a bit frustrating, isn’t it? All this paperwork for something that’s… well, common sense. Perhaps I should just call my daughter and ask? Though she’s always so busy… I wouldn’t want to bother her. It's just a letter, after all. I'm sure the landlord will understand, eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Deloris. It’s certainly not ideal to have to jump through hoops like this. And you’re right, it’s a letter, and hopefully the landlord will be reasonable. Given the difficulty in obtaining records, and without knowing the specifics of Precious’s care, I can still write a letter stating that you’ve been a responsible pet owner for a significant period of time, and that you understand the importance of proper animal care. I can emphasize your commitment to providing a safe and healthy environment for your pets. It might not be as detailed as the landlord would prefer, but it’s a good starting point. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. That would be… a relief, honestly. Just something to show that I'm a sensible person. That I care about animals. I'm sure it will be enough. Thank you. Truly. It’s just… I'm not very good with all this paperwork. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. You’ve been very patient with me. Thank you again. Now, how long will it take? And will I have to pay?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. It's my pleasure. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with paperwork, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. I can have the letter drafted and ready for you within the next hour. As for payment, we don’t typically charge for letters of this nature, especially when it's related to pet ownership. Consider it a small service to the community. While I’m finishing up, perhaps it would be helpful for your daughter to establish a record with a local veterinarian if she hasn’t already done so?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Truly. Thank you so much. And yes, you’re right about my daughter. She really should establish a record. I’ll mention it to her, though she’s a very independent young woman, you know? She does everything herself. But I’ll try. An hour? That’s wonderful. I can wait here, if you like. Though I do have a bit of a… appointment later this afternoon. Nothing important, really. Just… a hair appointment. But I can reschedule, if necessary. I just want to get this letter sorted. Thank you again, Doctor Asami. You’ve been a lifesaver. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. Don’t worry about rescheduling – an hour should be plenty of time. Feel free to relax in the waiting room, or if you prefer, I can call you when the letter is ready. I'll get to work on it right away.
