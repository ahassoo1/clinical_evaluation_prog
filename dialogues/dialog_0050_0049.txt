DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 83 years young. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor… Paraskev… whatever it was. That’s a mouthful! Well, I reckon it's me ears. They ain't what they used to be, that's for sure. Things are… muffled, y’know? Like talkin’ underwater, almost. It's been gettin' worse lately. I don't remember when exactly it started, but it's definitely harder to hear folks now.
DOCTOR: "Paraskevopoulos," if you please. Yes, well, hearing is a common concern at your age, Mr. Schneer. It is a gradual process for most. “Lately” is rather vague, however. Can you recall any specific event – a loud noise, perhaps an illness – that might have coincided with the onset of this muffling?
PATIENT: Oh, right, Paraskev… yes. Sorry 'bout that. A specific event… hmm. Now, let me think. I used to work in that shoe factory, y’know, makin’ all sorts of shoes. It was loud in there, real loud. Machines clatterin' all day long. Maybe… maybe it started around the time I retired from there? It's all a bit blurry, honestly. I don’t recall gettin’ sick or nothin’ special happenin' right before it started. Just…slowly got harder to hear, I guess. A long time ago now.
DOCTOR: "Slowly," is not terribly helpful for establishing a timeline, Mr. Schneer. But the shoe factory is… relevant. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can certainly cause hearing loss. Do you recall using any hearing protection while working at the factory?
PATIENT: Hearing protection… No, no, I don't think so. We didn't have much of that back then, not for folks like us on the line. Just… put up with the noise, I suppose. Everyone did. It was part of the job, y'know? Didn't think much of it at the time. It's only now, lookin’ back, that I reckon it probably wasn't a good thing.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Hindsight is always 20/20, Mr. Schneer. Now, let’s move on to some more specific questions. Aside from the muffling, have you noticed any ringing in your ears – a sort of persistent high-pitched tone?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, maybe. It’s not constant, not like a telephone, but… a sort of… faint whistle, now that ya mention it. It comes and goes. Usually when it's quiet, I think. Like… after everyone's gone to bed, or somethin'. It don’t bother me too much, but it’s there, sometimes. It's hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: "Faint whistle," is…helpful. Do you experience any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I’m a bit unsteady on me feet sometimes, but that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. I don’t feel like I’m spinnin’ around or nothin’. I just gotta hold onto things a bit more now than I used to. It’s just… part of bein’ 83, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Very well. Now, I'm going to need to perform a brief examination of your ears to get a better understanding of the situation. I will also need to check your overall hearing acuity. Please remain still and do not speak unless I ask you to.
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, alright? Me ears are a bit sensitive. And tell me if ya see anythin’ too scary.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is a moderate amount of cerumen – earwax – in both canals, which may be contributing to your hearing difficulties. The tympanic membranes – eardrums – appear intact, although slightly cloudy. No obvious signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I will perform a quick hearing test. I will play some tones at different frequencies, and I would like you to indicate when you hear them. This will help me assess the extent of your hearing loss.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. I'll do me best. Just tell me what to listen for. Hope it ain't too loud, me ears get kinda jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. Please raise your hand when you hear the tone, no matter how faint it may be. It's alright if you don't hear anything at all. We're just establishing a baseline. … Nothing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin'. Can't hear a thing. Maybe turn it up a bit? It's kinda like… waitin' for somethin' that ain't comin', y'know?
DOCTOR: … Still nothing. Hmm. This is… not surprising, given your history. The results indicate a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, with the greatest loss occurring in the higher frequencies. This type of hearing loss is often associated with prolonged noise exposure, and unfortunately, it is usually irreversible.
PATIENT: Irreversible? What do ya mean… irreversible? So… I ain’t gonna be hearin’ nothin’ better? Not ever? I… I thought maybe it was just wax or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, as I explained, this is likely due to damage to the delicate structures within your inner ear, sustained over years of exposure to loud noises. While we can manage the hearing loss, we cannot reverse it. Think of it like… a worn-out wire. We can amplify the signal, but we can’t repair the damage to the wire itself. However, there are options available to improve your quality of life. The most appropriate course of action would be a hearing aid evaluation with an audiologist. They can determine if you are a suitable candidate for hearing aids, and if so, fit you with devices that will amplify sounds and help you hear more clearly.
PATIENT: Hearing aids… I always thought them things was for… old folks. Folks who couldn't hear anything at all. I still hear somethin', just… muffled. And… expensive, ain’t they? I’m on a fixed income, Doctor. I don’t know if I can afford… them fancy things. I guess… I just wanted somethin’ simple. Maybe just clean out the wax?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, while cerumen impaction may contribute to your difficulties, it is not the primary cause. Cleaning out the wax will offer, at best, minimal improvement. As for the cost… yes, hearing aids can be a significant expense. However, Medicare does offer some coverage, and there are also various financing options available. I strongly recommend a consultation with an audiologist. They can assess your specific needs, discuss the various options available, and help you determine the best course of action. I will provide you with a referral. It is important to remember that untreated hearing loss can lead to social isolation, depression, and even cognitive decline. Ignoring the problem will not make it go away. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? Oh dear. Social… isolation, ya say? Well… I do spend a lot of time by myself these days. I… I reckon I ought to talk to this… audiologist, then. Just to see, ya know? Even if I can't afford nothin'. Thank ya, Doctor. For explainin’ things. Even the scary parts. I… I appreciate it. I think… that's all the questions I got for now. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. I trust you will schedule an appointment with the audiologist at your earliest convenience. Do not delay. The sooner you address this issue, the better. I wish you well. .
