DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It’s… different than usual, and not in a good way. I can't really describe it, just that it's not me. It started maybe a week or so ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body, Kerriann. It’s good you brought it to my attention. Changes like these can sometimes indicate underlying issues, so it’s important to investigate. When you say "different," could you elaborate a little?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think. It's… stronger, for one thing. I always sweat a little, especially doing the work I do – laying floors is hard work – but this is more noticeable. And it’s not just sweat, it’s… almost sour? Not like underarm deodorant didn’t work, just… the smell itself is different. It’s not like my usual scent, and I can smell it even after showering. Does that make sense? I really don't know how else to explain it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kerriann. “Stronger” and “sour” are helpful descriptors. And the fact that you notice it even after showering is also important. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm 49, like you know. I’m divorced, and I live alone. I work as a floor layer – it keeps me busy, that's for sure. I'm on Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, but nothing major has been wrong. I don’t really have any health problems, besides a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from the job. I try to eat okay – lots of vegetables, not too much junk food – and I drink plenty of water. I don't smoke and I hardly ever drink alcohol. Does that give you a good picture?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Kerriann, thank you. It sounds like you’re generally quite healthy, which is excellent. The arthritis is good to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this altered body odor?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. No, not really. No fever, no weight loss or gain. I haven't been feeling more tired than usual, and my appetite is normal. My digestion seems okay, no issues there. I haven't noticed any new rashes or skin changes, either. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been sweating a little more than usual overall, even when I’m not working. But I figured that was just the weather, it's been pretty hot lately. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good you mentioned the increased sweating, even at rest. It is important. Increased sweating, along with the change in odor, does warrant further investigation. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit more specifically. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, never. I've had the regular check-ups with Medicare, like I said, and they’ve never mentioned anything like that. No diabetes, no kidney problems, and definitely no thyroid issues. They check my blood pressure and cholesterol every year, and those are always fine too. I've never had any major illnesses or surgeries, honestly. Just the occasional cold, and a broken wrist when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I always thought I was pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring, Kerriann. It sounds like your previous medical history is quite unremarkable, which is good. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay, let me think about my family history... My mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85, so it didn't seem to bother her too much. My father had some heart problems later in life, but again, he lived a long life. My brother is healthy as far as I know, he doesn't really talk about his health much. As for grandparents… my maternal grandmother had arthritis, like me, and my paternal grandfather had… I think he had some kind of stomach trouble, but I don’t remember the details. Nothing really major on either side, as far as I know. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Kerriann. Knowing about the high blood pressure and heart problems is good to have. At this point, I’d like to ask a few questions about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements. Also, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, I don’t take any regular medications, nothing at all. I try to avoid them if I can. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either, I figure I get everything I need from my diet. And I don’t have any allergies, thankfully. No food allergies, no drug allergies, no environmental allergies. I can handle pollen and dust just fine. I haven’t had a reaction to anything in my life, as far as I know. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Kerriann. No medications or allergies simplifies things. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and take a quick look at your skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind at all. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin is warm and dry, no signs of infection or irritation. I don't notice any immediate abnormalities in your axillary region. Now, I’d like to check your thyroid gland. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you please extend your neck slightly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. Everything seems normal so far, Kerriann. However, given the change in your body odor and the increased sweating, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests will check your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid hormone levels, and complete blood count. It’s a standard procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of what might be going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Blood tests sound good. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Do I need to fast beforehand, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For these tests, I would prefer if you fasted for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can still drink water. We’ll schedule the tests for first thing tomorrow morning. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any significant changes in your condition, such as fever, weight loss, or severe fatigue, please don’t hesitate to contact us. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Eight hours fasting, I can definitely do that. And I'll contact you if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what’s going on. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. It's always best to investigate changes in your body, and I'm hopeful we'll find the cause soon. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the paperwork for the lab tests and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
