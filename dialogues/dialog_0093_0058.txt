DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Vicent. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s become…difficult as I’ve gotten older, you see. And my wife…she always kept me on track. It’s been hard since she passed.
DOCTOR: I see, Vicent. I am very sorry to hear about your wife. Losing a loved one is tremendously difficult, and it's perfectly understandable that routines – and health habits – can be disrupted. It takes time to adjust. So, you'd like to discuss weight loss. That's a very sensible goal. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about how long you’ve noticed this difficulty with weight, and approximately how much weight you’ve gained since your wife passed?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s been…about three years now, since she’s been gone. And the weight…oh, goodness. I don’t know exactly, but probably twenty, maybe twenty-five pounds. I used to be around 155, and now…well, I stepped on the scale the other day and it was closer to 180. I try not to look, honestly. It just…disheartens me. I’m still active, I do some wood carving, but it’s not the same.
DOCTOR: Twenty to twenty-five pounds over three years… I appreciate you sharing that with me, Vicent. It takes courage to address these things. And it's good to hear you remain active with your wood carving. That’s a wonderful hobby. To get a more complete picture, could you describe your typical daily diet for me?
PATIENT: Well…that’s not a pretty picture, Doctor. I’m retired, you see, and my wife did most of the cooking. Since she’s been gone, I mostly eat…simple things. Toast for breakfast, maybe an egg if I’m feeling ambitious. Lunch is usually a sandwich, ham and cheese, nothing fancy. Dinner…that’s where I get into trouble. I eat a lot of rice, with maybe some fish or chicken. And I have a sweet tooth, I admit it. A little piece of cake with my dinner sometimes. Or cookies. I try to drink water, but…I enjoy a glass of juice with my meals. It’s just easier, you know? I don't have the energy to cook proper meals anymore.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest with me, Vicent. It’s very helpful to have this information. It sounds like a fairly typical pattern for someone experiencing loss and change in routine. We can certainly work with that. Now, aside from the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My knees bother me more these days, especially when I’m standing for long periods. And I get tired easier, like…a deeper kind of tired than just needing a nap. I used to be able to work on my carvings all day, but now I have to take breaks. And sometimes…sometimes I feel a little short of breath, even just walking around the house. Nothing major, mind you, but it’s there. Oh, and my doctor, before, she said my blood sugar was a little high. She didn't say anything too concerning, but she did want me to watch it. I haven't been back to see her in a while. Medicare doesn't cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Vicent. That is very important information. The knee pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, and history of elevated blood sugar are all things we need to consider. It's good you mentioned the previous doctor’s comment about your blood sugar. To clarify, when you say "a little high," do you recall approximately what your blood sugar reading was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question, Doctor. I honestly don't remember the exact number. It was a couple of years ago now, and I wasn't really paying close attention. She just said it was borderline, and to try and cut back on sweets. I think it was in the 130s, maybe 140s after I ate? I'm just guessing, really. I'm not good with numbers. It was just…a number. And it went up if I had something sweet, I think she said. I mostly just try to avoid thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Vicent. It’s easy to dismiss things when we’re overwhelmed. A reading in the 130s-140s after eating does suggest some degree of pre-diabetes or early diabetes, and it’s good we are addressing it now. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I would like to order some blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a chemistry panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, and a fasting blood sugar and HbA1c test to evaluate your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please. I just want to feel better, you know? And I want to be able to keep working on my carvings. They’re…they’re important to me. So, whatever you think is best. Medicare should cover that, shouldn’t it? I hope so. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Vicent. Medicare should cover these standard blood tests. We’ll double-check with them before processing anything, of course, to avoid any surprises. Excellent. Now, before we proceed with the blood work, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just…try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have a little carving I’m trying to finish, a little bird for my granddaughter. She’s coming to visit next month. I want it to be perfect. It’s…a small thing, but it matters.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Vicent. We’ll be as efficient as possible. A gift for your granddaughter is a wonderful motivation. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I’ll gently wrap the cuff around it. 148 over 92…slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. There's some tenderness to the inner aspect of both knees, and mild swelling. Range of motion is slightly limited. Your heart and lungs sound good, Vicent. Your knees do show some signs of wear and tear, likely contributing to your pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. And I don't take any regular medication. Just a little fish oil sometimes, for my joints. My friend recommended it. It doesn’t seem to help much, honestly. I mostly just take it because he said I should. He's a retired pharmacist, so I figured he knew what he was talking about. But that’s it. Nothing else. And I haven't had any surgeries, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Vicent. The fish oil is unlikely to be significantly impacting anything, but it’s always helpful to have a complete picture. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief physical exam, we have a few things to address. You’re experiencing weight gain, fatigue, and knee pain, and you have a history of slightly elevated blood sugar. I’ve ordered the blood work to get a clearer understanding of your current health status. Once the results are back, we can discuss a comprehensive plan, which may include dietary modifications, exercise recommendations, and potentially medication if necessary. Would you be open to discussing a referral to a registered dietitian?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…reasonable. A dietitian might be helpful. I’m not very good at planning meals, as I said. My wife always did that. So yes, if you think it would be a good idea, please. I just want to get back to feeling like myself again. And finish that carving for my granddaughter. When do you think the results will be back? I'm not a patient man, you know. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Vicent. It’s perfectly natural to want answers quickly. The blood work typically takes 2-3 business days to process. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’ll put in a referral to a registered dietitian. They’ll contact you to schedule an initial consultation. I'm optimistic we can create a plan to help you achieve your goals. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything, really. Just…thank you. For listening, and for not dismissing my concerns. It means a lot. Sometimes I feel like people don’t take older folks seriously. I appreciate your time, and your kindness. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Vicent. It’s my pleasure, and you absolutely deserve to be taken seriously. Your health and well-being are my top priority. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Vicent. And please, enjoy working on your carving. I'm sure your granddaughter will cherish it. .
