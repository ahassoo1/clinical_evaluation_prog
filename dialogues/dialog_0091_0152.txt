DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. That's why I’m here. Hyper… something? They used a big word. I just want to know what that means, really.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Geho. I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to want clarification when receiving medical results, especially with terminology that can be unfamiliar. The letter likely refers to hyperlipidemia – that’s the term for high cholesterol. To understand the situation better and determine the best course of action, could you tell me if you've experienced any symptoms that prompted you to get your cholesterol checked, or was this part of a routine screening?
PATIENT: Oh, routine screening, yes. My regular doctor – Dr. Van Derlyn – she does a big check-up every year. Blood work and everything. I didn’t feel anything wrong, that's why I was surprised by the letter. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… nothing like that. She just said I should come see someone… a specialist, she called you. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Geho. Dr. Van Derlyn is a fine physician. I see here the results of your recent lipid panel. We’ll review those together in a moment. Before we do that, could you please tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay. Let's see… I haven’t had much trouble, honestly. I had chickenpox as a child, and I broke my wrist once falling off a bicycle – a very long time ago! No major illnesses, no surgeries… just the usual yearly check-ups. My mother… she had some trouble with her blood pressure when she got older, but she lived to be eighty-nine, so I guess she did okay. My father was very healthy, never sick a day in his life! Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Geho, thank you. A family history of blood pressure issues is good to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. One of those one-a-day things. And sometimes, if my knees are bothering me, I take ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I need it. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat a lot of vegetables, and I walk every morning.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Geho. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. And thank you for letting me know about the occasional ibuprofen use. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten shellfish my whole life, no problems. I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’m pretty lucky, I think. My sister… she's allergic to penicillin, but I don’t have any of those problems.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Geho. So, to summarise, you’re currently feeling well, with no significant medical history, no medications other than a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen, and no known allergies. Now, let’s take a look at those cholesterol results from Dr. Van Derlyn. We’ll break down what those numbers mean and discuss potential next steps. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I’m ready when you are. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. I like being active, and I don’t want to have to stop doing things. I don’t even know what “high cholesterol” means, really. What does it do to you?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Ms. Geho. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. Essentially, cholesterol is a fatty substance that’s essential for building healthy cells in your body. However, too much cholesterol can build up in your arteries, forming plaque. This plaque can narrow your arteries, making it harder for blood to flow, and increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. There are different types of cholesterol. The main ones we focus on are LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, which is often called “bad” cholesterol, and HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, often called “good” cholesterol. HDL helps remove LDL from the arteries. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood, and high levels can also increase your risk. Looking at your results here… your LDL is slightly elevated at 145 mg/dL, ideally we like to see that below 100. Your HDL is 50, which is good, and your triglycerides are within the normal range. Your total cholesterol is 220. Given these numbers, it’s not immediately a cause for alarm, but it does warrant attention. Would you be comfortable if I perform a brief physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little more sense. So, the bad one is a little high, but the good one is good. That's… reassuring, I guess. Yes, a physical exam sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm just trying to understand what all this means. And what we can do about it. Do I need to… change my diet? Take a pill? I hope it doesn’t come to pills.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll take things one step at a time, Ms. Geho. Many times, lifestyle modifications are sufficient to manage cholesterol levels. We’ll discuss all options before considering medication. First, let’s get through this quick exam. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Everything sounds and appears normal. Now, let’s discuss some lifestyle modifications. Are you willing to work with me on incorporating some changes into your routine?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I want to do whatever I can to keep healthy. I walk every morning, like I said. I can try to walk a little faster, maybe? And I do try to eat vegetables, but I do like my cheese… and sometimes a little chocolate. What kind of changes are we talking about? Be honest with me, Doctor. I don’t want to make drastic changes if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible attitude, Ms. Geho. We’re not aiming for drastic changes, but rather gradual, sustainable improvements. First, let’s focus on diet. Reducing saturated and trans fats is key. These are often found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. You mentioned enjoying cheese and chocolate, which are fine in moderation, but we might want to opt for lower-fat varieties and limit portion sizes. Increasing soluble fiber intake can also help lower LDL cholesterol – things like oats, beans, and fruits. Regarding exercise, continuing your daily walks is excellent. Aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week is ideal. Increasing the intensity slightly, as you suggested, would be beneficial. We can also discuss a referral to a registered dietitian for personalized dietary guidance, if you'd like. I’d like to repeat your lipid panel in three months to assess your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… doable. Less cheese, more oats. I can definitely manage that. And I can walk faster. I think I can commit to that. A dietitian… hmm. Maybe. Let's see how I do with just changing my diet and walking a bit more first. I don't want to add too many things at once. Three months to recheck… good. That gives me time. What about… supplements? I’ve heard things about fish oil and… red yeast rice? Do those actually work? My neighbor swears by them.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Geho, and one I hear frequently. The evidence regarding supplements for lowering cholesterol is… mixed. Fish oil, containing omega-3 fatty acids, has shown some benefit in lowering triglycerides, but its impact on LDL cholesterol is often modest. Red yeast rice contains a naturally occurring statin, and can lower cholesterol levels, but it’s important to be very cautious. The amount of statin in these supplements can vary significantly, and they can interact with other medications. Also, because they contain a statin, they can have the same potential side effects as a statin medication. I generally recommend focusing on lifestyle modifications as the first line of defense, and avoiding supplements unless specifically recommended and monitored by a healthcare professional. Because of the potential risks and lack of consistent regulation, I wouldn’t recommend starting either fish oil or red yeast rice at this time. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Less cheese, more oats, walk faster, and don’t bother with the supplements. I can remember that. Thank you for your time. And for not making me feel like I’m in terrible trouble. It’s a little scary when you find out something is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when receiving medical results, but remember, we’re addressing this proactively, and small changes can make a significant difference. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion, including these recommendations. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I look forward to seeing you again in three months. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Geho.
