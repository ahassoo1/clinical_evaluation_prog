DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Edric. It’s good to meet you too. Well, to be frank, my muscles just feel… weak. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's starting to worry me. I don't really know how else to explain it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Edric. Weakness is certainly something we should investigate. When you say “a little while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I'd say, around… late March, maybe early April? It wasn't bad at first, just a little tiredness after work, you know? But it's gotten steadily worse since then. Now it's… noticeable, even doing simple things. Like carrying groceries. Or getting up from a chair. It's just… harder. I remember specifically struggling with a bag of cement on the 14th of May. That’s when I really started paying attention.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed timeline, Edric. That’s very helpful. And you mentioned it’s affecting simple tasks – carrying groceries, rising from a chair. Is this weakness generalized, meaning all over your body, or is it more pronounced in certain areas?
PATIENT: It's… mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, a little. My hands feel clumsy sometimes, like I can't grip things properly. My back too, but that could just be from work, honestly. I do a lot of bending and lifting as an appraiser, you know? But yeah, definitely worse in my legs. Getting up stairs is… a chore now. I used to be able to run up them two at a time. Now? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness in the legs and arms, with some clumsiness in the hands. And you suspect your back discomfort might be work-related, which is reasonable given your profession. Now, let’s try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from… well, everything. And maybe a little bit of cramping in my calves sometimes, but that comes and goes. Nothing major, honestly. I haven’t been sick, no fever, no dizziness… just the weakness. Oh! And I’ve been feeling a little thirsty more often, now that I think about it. But again, it’s August, it’s hot. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Edric. No fever, dizziness, or illness. Increased thirst could be relevant, and we'll certainly consider that. You mentioned the cramping in your calves. Is that constant, or does it come and go with activity?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Mostly after I’ve been on my feet all day, or if I’ve been doing a lot of walking. It’s not excruciating, just… uncomfortable. Like a tight feeling. It usually goes away if I sit down and rest for a bit. Nothing I’d really write home about, to be honest. But it's there. I haven’t taken anything for it, just tried to stretch them out. Sometimes that helps, sometimes it doesn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent calf cramping, relieved somewhat by stretching. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years? Just for a check-up. I usually just try to tough things out, to be honest. I don’t like doctors visits if I can avoid them. I remember getting a flu shot in 2019, that's about it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Edric. It’s good to know you haven’t had any major medical diagnoses and that your last significant medical contact was the flu shot in 2019. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, up until now, I guess. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that was just a cast and a sling. Nothing major. I've never even had stitches, believe it or not. I'm a pretty careful guy, usually.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Edric. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My father had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, pretty bad towards the end. She was always complaining about her joints. My grandfather on my father’s side… he had something with his heart, I think, but I don’t really know the details. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. That's about all I know, honestly. We weren't a big family for sharing medical details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother, and some heart condition in your paternal grandfather. That’s helpful. Let's discuss your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don't really care for the taste. I have a beer maybe once a month with dinner, sometimes less. And definitely no drugs. I'm a pretty straight-laced guy, to be honest. Work pretty hard, come home, relax. That's about it. I do drink a lot of coffee though, if that counts. Several cups a day, to keep me going.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no drug use. Several cups of coffee a day. That’s good to know. Finally, let's briefly discuss allergies and any medications you're currently taking. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to any medication. And as for medications… nothing. I don’t take any pills, creams, or anything like that. I’m a big believer in letting my body heal itself if it can. I’ve always been lucky that I haven't needed to rely on medication. So no, nothing at all. I'm really hoping that's still true.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. No known allergies and no current medications. That completes our initial history. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and assessing your muscle strength and range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Let’s get it over with, if you don’t mind. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to work, if possible. I have a few appraisals scheduled for next week. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Edric. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm… and I’ll gently tap this tendon. Good. Normal response on both sides. Next, let’s assess your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can… Excellent. Strength appears normal in your hands. Now, I’d like you to push against my hand with your legs… This will be a bit awkward, but it will give me an idea of your leg strength. Could you push against my resistance?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. I push, straining slightly. It's… harder than it used to be. I feel like I'm having to work a lot harder to push against your resistance. It's not weak, exactly, but it's definitely… tiring. And it feels a little shaky, honestly. More on this side… I indicate my left leg. This side feels a little stronger. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. I noticed that as well. There is some weakness in your left lower extremity compared to your right. It’s not profound, but it’s definitely present. I’m also noticing some mild fasciculations – small, involuntary muscle twitches – in your calves. Now, I’m going to check your gait – how you walk – to see if I can observe any further abnormalities. Would you mind walking a few steps across the room, please?
PATIENT: Okay… here I go. I walk, taking slightly shorter steps than usual. It feels… a little unsteady, to be honest. I’m trying to walk normally, but I feel like I’m having to think about each step. My left leg feels a little… dragging, almost. Is that obvious? I don’t usually pay attention to how I walk, to be honest. It’s probably nothing, I just… noticed it now that you’re looking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Edric. I did notice some asymmetry in your gait, with a slight circumduction – a wider swing – of your left leg. It’s subtle, but it’s present. Based on the physical exam findings – the weakness in your left lower extremity, the fasciculations, and the gait abnormality – I am concerned about a possible neurological issue. I want to order some blood work and an MRI of your lumbar spine to further investigate. The blood work will help rule out any vitamin deficiencies or inflammatory conditions. The MRI will allow us to visualize your spinal cord and identify any potential compression or damage. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. But yeah, if that’s what you think is best, then do it. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t like the sound of a “neurological issue,” to be honest. But I trust your judgement, Doctor. What kind of timeline are we looking at? How long before we get results? And… what if it is something bad? I have a family to support, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Edric. It’s natural to feel anxious when faced with the possibility of a serious diagnosis. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging study and will give us valuable information. Regarding the timeline, I’ll write the orders for the blood work and MRI right now. You can schedule the MRI at the imaging center across town. They typically have appointments available within the next few days. The blood work can be done at our lab here in the clinic. We should have the blood work results back within 24 to 48 hours. The MRI report usually takes 2 to 3 business days to finalize. Regarding the “what ifs,” it’s too early to speculate on a specific diagnosis. The MRI will help us narrow down the possibilities. Potential causes could range from a simple nerve compression to a more complex neurological condition. I want to assure you that we’ll explore all options and develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. We will discuss everything in detail once we have the results. To be safe, and depending on the results, I may also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activities that exacerbate your symptoms. Do you have any questions about this, or about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot to take in. A couple of days for the blood work, a few for the MRI… I can manage that. No strenuous activities… fine. I mostly do desk work anyway. What about the MRI itself? Is it painful? Claustrophobic? I’ve heard stories… And what kind of prep is involved? Do I need to fast, or anything like that? And… how much is all this going to cost? I don’t have the best insurance, as you know. It’s just… a lot to think about. Sorry, I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Edric. These are all very valid concerns, and I’m happy to address them. The MRI itself is not painful. It utilizes strong magnets and radio waves to create images of your spinal cord. You will lie on a table that slides into the scanner. You will need to remain very still during the scan, which typically lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. Regarding claustrophobia, the scanner is a narrow tube, and some patients do experience anxiety in confined spaces. We can offer you a mild sedative to help you relax if you’re concerned about this. Just let the technician know. There’s minimal prep involved. You don’t need to fast, but please remove any metal objects – jewelry, watches, belt buckles – before the scan, as they can interfere with the imaging. Regarding the cost, I understand your insurance situation. I’ll have our billing department contact you with an estimate of the costs for both the blood work and the MRI. They can also discuss potential payment options. They'll also work with the imaging center to determine if any discounts are available. In the meantime, I’m going to write these orders and give you a referral slip for the imaging center. Here is some information about the imaging center, their contact number and the address. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… manageable. No fasting, potential sedative… that’s good. I’ll talk to the billing department, see what the damage will be. No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, answering all my questions. I appreciate it. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Edric. I understand your concerns, and I’m here to support you through this process. Remember, we’re taking these steps to get a clear diagnosis and develop the best possible treatment plan. I’ll have the nurse come in and take your blood. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, Edric. .
