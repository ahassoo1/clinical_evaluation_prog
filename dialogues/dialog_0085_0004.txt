DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor! Nice to meet you too. Just here for my yearly shots, I think. Routine stuff, you know? Gotta keep everything up to date.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, staying on top of preventative care is very important. And it’s good you’re thinking ahead. Before we do those, let's just do a quick check-in to see how you’re feeling overall. Has anything new come up in the past year, or are you experiencing any symptoms that are concerning you?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. My knees have been a little creakier, if that makes sense? Old age, I guess! But nothing I can't walk off. Otherwise, I'm feeling pretty good, all things considered. How about you, Doctor? Long day already?
DOCTOR: It is a bit busy, yes, but it's good to be helping people. “Creaky knees” – I understand completely! That’s a common complaint. We can certainly talk about that today. Just to get a better picture, is that creakiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. Worse when it's cold, or if I've been on my feet all day at a job site. I do a lot of walking when I'm inspecting buildings, you know? Not like running around, but… a good amount. It doesn’t really stop me from doing anything though. Mostly just a little annoying, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it’s activity-related and worse in colder weather. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Not really pain, exactly. More like… stiffness? And sometimes a little clicking sound, if I bend them a certain way. It’s not sharp or anything, just… noticeable. I can usually work it out with a little movement. Honestly, I probably just need to remember to stretch more. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Stiffness and clicking, activity-related. Stretching is a wonderful idea! It’s good you’re aware of that. Let's do a quick physical exam of your knees, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just let me know if it'll be uncomfortable, okay? I'm not a fan of anything too… pokey.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be gentle. We’re just checking range of motion and looking for any swelling or tenderness. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, Ms. Fornes, I'm feeling some slight crepitus – that’s the clicking you mentioned – in both knees, which is common with some wear and tear. Range of motion is good, a little bit of stiffness when I first bend them, but it improves quickly. No significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. Your gait looks stable.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… about right, honestly. I figured it was just getting old! So, nothing wrong wrong, then? Just a little wear and tear?
DOCTOR: That’s a good way to put it – some normal wear and tear for someone who’s active. It doesn’t sound like anything serious is going on. We can manage this conservatively. I recommend continuing to stretch regularly, especially before and after activity. You could also consider using a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement – some people find those helpful for joint health, although the evidence is mixed. Would you be interested in learning some specific stretches I can recommend?
PATIENT: Yeah, stretches would be great, actually! I always forget what ones are best. And I'll look into that supplement thing, too. Glucosamine… chondroitin… gotta write that down. Are there any I should avoid doing, or things I should be careful of? Just want to make sure I don't pull anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are a few that are generally helpful – hamstring stretches, quad stretches, and calf stretches. It’s important to warm up before stretching – a few minutes of light walking is good. And definitely listen to your body – you shouldn't feel sharp pain, just a gentle pull. Avoid any stretches that cause significant pain, and be careful with deep squats or lunges if they cause discomfort. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you get more flexible. Do you have any history of knee injuries?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… No, not really. I twisted my ankle pretty bad when I was a teenager, playing basketball, but that was a long time ago. Nothing with my knees specifically. I've just always been… clumsy, I guess? Tripping over air, that kind of thing. But never any actual injuries that needed a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. A history of ankle injuries can sometimes affect gait and put more stress on the knees, but it doesn’t sound like that’s a major factor here. So, to recap, we’ve discussed continuing regular stretching, considering glucosamine and chondroitin, and listening to your body. Now, about those yearly shots you mentioned… are you referring to a flu shot, or are there others you’d like to receive today?
PATIENT: Oh! Right, the shots. Yeah, I usually get the flu shot. And… tetanus, I think? I always forget exactly which ones I need. Whatever keeps me from getting sick, really. I’m not great with needles, but I know it’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, staying up-to-date with vaccinations is very important. Let me check your vaccination record… Okay, it looks like you are due for your annual flu shot, and your tetanus booster is also due. That will be two quick injections today. We can talk about any concerns you have about the needles. I can also offer a topical numbing cream to minimize discomfort if you'd like.
PATIENT: Oh, that’d be wonderful if you had that numbing cream. I really don't love needles, to put it mildly. Just… the quicker the better, I guess? And maybe don't tell me when you're about to do it? Just… surprise me? Is that weird?
DOCTOR: Not weird at all! We can absolutely do that. I completely understand. The numbing cream will help minimize the sensation. I’ll apply it to both sites now, let it sit for a few minutes, and then we can get it over with quickly and efficiently. You don't have to say a word, I can just let you know when we're finished. While that's working, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no known allergies. I eat pretty much everything. My husband always jokes I have a cast iron stomach. Although, I do get a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat something too spicy. But that’s it. No serious allergies, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. And we’ll steer clear of anything too spicy, just in case. Alright, Ms. Fornes, everything is ready to go when you are. I will just let you know when I’m finished. All done! You didn't even flinch. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn’t… as bad as I thought, actually. A little pinch, but… manageable. Definitely better than I expected. Thank you for the cream, and for not announcing it beforehand! That really helped. So, what now? Do I need to stay here for a bit, or can I go?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! I'm glad it wasn’t too bad. It’s always a little nerve-wracking. I recommend staying here for about 15-20 minutes just to make sure you don’t have any immediate reaction, although it's very unlikely. You might feel a little soreness at the injection sites for a day or two, but that’s normal. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with that. Are you experiencing any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No dizziness or shortness of breath. Feeling perfectly fine, actually. Just a little… relieved it’s over! Fifteen minutes is no problem, I’ve got nowhere to be. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should be looking out for? Just want to be extra careful. Old habits, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Just continue to monitor the injection sites for any signs of infection—increased redness, swelling, or pus. And if you develop a fever or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Otherwise, just go about your usual activities. Stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. I’ll send a reminder for your yearly check-up next year. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I really appreciate you being so patient with me. I’ll definitely be back next year. Thank you again for everything! Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a wonderful day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care!
