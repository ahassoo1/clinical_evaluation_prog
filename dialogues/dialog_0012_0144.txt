DOCTOR: Hi Lilly, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Dr. Yoshino, is it? Yes, well, I just… thought I'd come in. My daughter kept telling me to get a check-up, you know? Said I needed to make sure everything was still… working. Honestly, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Just being… thorough, I suppose. It's been a while since I’ve seen a doctor, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Lilly – it’s always good to be thorough, and listen to your daughter! It sounds like you’re being very proactive about your health, and that’s fantastic. And yes, it's perfectly okay if it's been a while since your last check-up. We'll just get a good overview of how things are doing. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about how you’ve been feeling overall?
PATIENT: Oh, well, like I said, fine. Mostly. My knees ache a bit when it rains, always have, but nothing I can't ignore. And I get tired easier than I used to, I suppose. But who doesn’t get tired? I used to be able to garden all day, now… maybe an hour or so. But that's just getting old, isn't it? It’s not like it’s something to worry about. My daughter worries too much, honestly. She gets it from her father.
DOCTOR: It is good you can still garden, even for an hour! And you’re right, some aches and fatigue can definitely come with getting older. But it’s also good to rule out anything else that might be going on, just to be sure. Your daughter sounds like a caring person, and it's always wise to check things out. So, just to clarify, the knee pain is specifically when it rains, and the fatigue is something that's gradually gotten worse?
PATIENT: Gradually, yes. That's a good word for it. It's not like I woke up one day and couldn’t move. More like… little by little. And the knees… well, sometimes not just when it rains. Cold weather too, I think. Dampness, definitely. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to it unless it’s bothering me. It’s just…old lady stuff, you know? Is this really necessary? It feels like a waste of everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: It’s not a waste of time at all, Lilly. We want to make sure you’re feeling your best, and sometimes “old lady stuff” – as you call it – can be easily addressed. And sometimes it can be a sign of something else we should take a look at. Let’s just go through a little bit more detail, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. Honestly, I don't remember the last time anyone asked me this much about myself. It was probably when I renewed my driver’s license. Where do you want to start? I haven't been sick, if that's what you're wondering. No fever, no cough, no… anything like that. Just the knees and being tired. And maybe a bit forgetful, but that’s just… age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Lilly. No fever or cough is good to know. We’ll just cover a few things to get a better picture. Forgetfulness can be normal with age, but it’s good to understand how much it’s affecting your daily life. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking things I really don't remember. My husband, bless his soul, took care of all that. He went to all the appointments, kept track of the medications… I just took the pills he gave me. I think… I think he said something about my cholesterol being a little high once? But honestly, it was so long ago. And he's been gone… almost ten years now. I really don't remember the specifics. I apologize. Is this really important?
DOCTOR: It's absolutely okay, Lilly. It's very common to not remember details after a long time, especially when someone else managed the medical details. And it is helpful to have a general idea, but we can work around it if you don’t recall specifics. Okay, let’s try this. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that’s a good question. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that much I remember. And… oh! When I broke my wrist, many years ago. I fell off a ladder while picking apples. My husband took me to the hospital, of course. And… I think I had a hysterectomy at some point? But honestly, it was such a blur. I was in a lot of pain, I remember that. And again, he handled everything. I feel like a terrible patient. I’m not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Lilly! It's perfectly normal to not remember every detail. And you’ve given me some good information. Tonsils out, broken wrist, and a hysterectomy – that’s a great start. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… well, my mother lived to be a very old age, almost ninety. She was strong as an ox, always gardening, always busy. She didn’t really get sick, as far as I know. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was still quite young, so I don’t remember much about it. And my sister… she had diabetes, but she didn't take care of herself, poor thing. She ate too much sugar. Honestly, everyone just gets old and… things happen, you know? Is this getting us anywhere? I feel like we're just going in circles.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Lilly. Heart trouble in your father and diabetes in your sister are good things to be aware of. And you’re right, it can feel like going in circles sometimes, but we’re building a picture here. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking any vitamins, supplements, or prescription medications right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I take a… a little white pill every morning. My daughter gives it to me. Something for my… my blood pressure, I think? And I take a calcium tablet, because of my bones. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take… ibuprofen, I think it’s called? The over-the-counter kind. Honestly, I don't really pay attention to the names. My daughter handles all that, really. She’s very organized. I'm just… the patient.
DOCTOR: Okay, a white pill for blood pressure, calcium, and ibuprofen for your knees – that's good to know. It sounds like your daughter is a wonderful support. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I used to get hay fever when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. And I’m a little sensitive to the cold, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Honestly, I don’t think I have any allergies. Are we done yet? I’m getting a little tired. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lilly, we’re almost done with the questions! Just a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of things. It won’t take long. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. And finally, I’ll take a look at your knees. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. Honestly, I haven't had a proper check-up in years. Just do whatever you need to do. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. But please, don't take too long. My knees are starting to ache again. And I have a feeling it's going to rain later. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… That’s good. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Okay, and your knees… there's some mild tenderness to palpation on both sides, and a slight limitation in range of motion, particularly with extension. No significant swelling or warmth. Alright, Lilly, that's all I need for now. Thanks for your patience.
