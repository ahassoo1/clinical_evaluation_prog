DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. It's… a long story, really. I suppose it’s this… sadness. It just won’t lift. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll try to be efficient. When you say “sadness,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I’m crying all the time, though I have had a few nights. More like… a weight. Everything feels… heavy. I don't enjoy things like I used to. Even my garden, which was always my pride and joy, just feels… like work now. And I’m tired. Very, very tired. I used to be so active, you know, with the lifeguarding and the ski patrol. Now… I just want to rest. Is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It sounds quite distressing. So, this feeling of… weight, lack of enjoyment, and fatigue – how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been… at least six months, I would say. Maybe longer. Time… it just seems to slip away these days. It started gradually, I think. A little less enthusiasm here, a little more tiredness there. But it’s gotten worse in the last few months, definitely. I just… hoped it would pass. I don't usually bother doctors for things like feelings, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Six months or more, gradually worsening. I appreciate you coming in now, despite that. Let's go through a bit of a checklist, if you don't mind, just to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep – either sleeping too much or having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Both, if I’m honest. Some nights I can’t get to sleep at all, just tossing and turning. And then other nights… I sleep for hours and hours, and still wake up feeling exhausted. It’s very frustrating. It's not a regular thing, mind you. One night is good, the next is terrible. Very unpredictable. I suppose that makes it harder to deal with.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable sleep. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Yes. Not much of an appetite, really. I used to love to cook, Nigerian food especially, very flavorful, you know? But now… food just doesn’t appeal. I’m forcing myself to eat, just enough to keep going, but I’ve lost weight, I suspect. My clothes are a little looser. It’s not a huge amount, but noticeable. My daughter commented on it when she visited last month.
DOCTOR: I see your weight is down about 5 pounds from your last check-up six months ago. Okay. Have you been experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! That's been… troubling. I forget things constantly. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I was just saying, names of people I’ve known for years! It’s embarrassing, really. And I find it hard to focus on anything for very long. Even watching television is difficult. I keep losing the thread of the story. It worries me, honestly. I always prided myself on my sharp mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any physical symptoms – aches, pains, headaches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My back aches a bit, but I suppose that’s just from years of being active. And I get headaches occasionally, tension headaches, I think. Nothing terrible. But I wouldn't say they're new. They come and go. I do feel… generally weak, though. Like I haven't got the energy for much. Is that a symptom? It's hard to separate what’s physical and what’s… this feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness, tension headaches, and some back pain. Now, just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any significant life stressors or changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Where do I begin? My divorce was finalized two years ago now, and it's still… difficult. We were married a long time, you know? And my daughter, she moved to America last year with her family. I miss them terribly. And… well, getting older isn’t easy either. Friends are getting sick, passing away… It feels like a lot, if you understand. It’s not one big thing, but a lot of small things adding up, I suppose. I don’t usually complain, but it's been… a lot.
DOCTOR: That is a lot, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like you’ve been through a great deal, and are still dealing with significant changes and losses. Okay. Just to complete the picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I take a medication for my blood pressure – amlodipine, I think it’s called. Small dose, nothing much. And I have an allergy to penicillin, discovered that as a child. Other than that, I’m fairly healthy, for my age, at least I was. That’s all, I think. I have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I'd like to know what you think is going on, if you don't mind. I really do dislike sitting around dwelling on things, and I'm hoping we can find a solution.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Derasmo. Based on what you’ve told me – the prolonged sadness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite and enjoyment, difficulty concentrating, and the significant life stressors – it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to remember that depression isn’t a sign of weakness, and it's very treatable. It’s also very common, especially with the kinds of life changes you’ve described. Now, to confirm this, and rule out any other possible causes, I’d like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and do a general health panel. And I'd also like to do a brief physical exam - just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work and a physical exam. Very well. I'd rather get this sorted than sit around feeling sorry for myself. So, yes, please. Let’s get on with it, if you don’t mind. I have a bridge club meeting tomorrow, and I'd like to be able to concentrate on the cards, not on how tired I am. What do we need to do first?
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, we'll do the physical exam. It'll just be a quick check. Then we'll draw some blood. After that, we can discuss some potential treatment options, which might include therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get it done, if you would. I'm ready when you are. And please, don’t take too long. I appreciate your efficiency, Doctor. It’s a rare quality these days. Let’s proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please have a seat here, and we'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Just relax your arm… Good. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Not alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me... and another... Good. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Any pain when I press here on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. A little tender, perhaps, but no pain. I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining. Just want to feel like myself again. Get on with it, if you would. This is all taking up a good part of my afternoon. I have a garden to tend, you know. I'm missing prime weeding time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears physically normal at this point, which supports the likelihood of this being related to mood. Now, I’ll have the nurse draw some blood. That will take just a few minutes, and then we can discuss your options. I’ll order the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, vitamin D and B12 levels. Those will give us a good baseline. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
