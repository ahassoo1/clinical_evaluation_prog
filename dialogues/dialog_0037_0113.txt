DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Octavis, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this…this going to the bathroom business. Too much of it, you see. All the time. It’s a nuisance, really. Can’t even enjoy a good cup of tea without…well, you get the picture. It's been going on for…oh, goodness, I couldn't rightly say how long. A while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. “A while” is helpful, but to get a better idea of what's going on, could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific, eh? Always with the specifics. Honestly, Doctor, at my age, things blur together. Let me think… maybe… three, four months? Or was it last winter? It's hard to say. It wasn't sudden, not like a…a burst pipe or anything. Just…gradually more and more often. More often than a man should have to go, that's for certain. I used to be able to hold it for hours, now…well, now it's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, three or four months of gradually increasing frequency. That gives us a starting point. And you mentioned it's become embarrassing – I appreciate you sharing that with me, that helps me understand how much this is impacting you. To clarify, when you need to go, do you feel a strong, sudden urge, or is it more of a constant feeling like you should go?
PATIENT: Hmm. Good question, Doctor. Not a sudden urge, no. It’s not like a… a fire alarm going off. It’s more of a… nagging. A constant little voice saying, "You might want to go." And then, inevitably, I do want to go. It’s just… always there, lurking in the background. Not painful, mind you. Just… annoying. And disruptive. Like a fly buzzing around your head. You swat at it, but it keeps coming back. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: I do, perfectly. A constant nagging sensation, not a painful urge. That’s helpful. Now, when you actually go to the bathroom, do you feel like you're able to empty your bladder completely, or do you feel like you’re still retaining some urine?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not completely. It feels like… like there’s always a little bit left. It’s not a lot, mind you, but enough to feel it. And then, not five minutes later, that nagging feeling returns. It's frustrating, truly. A man shouldn’t have to worry about these things. I always had a strong bladder. Used to be able to go all day without a visit. Now… now I feel like a leaky faucet. Do you understand what I mean? It’s not a powerful stream, either. Weak. Just… dribbles. It's all quite undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. Incomplete emptying, a weak stream, and that residual feeling are all important details. And I assure you, it's perfectly normal to be concerned about these changes. Now, let’s move on to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine? What do you mean? Is it supposed to change? I always thought… well, it’s just urine, Doctor. A certain… colour. Always been that colour, as far as I can recall. Maybe a little darker if I haven’t had enough to drink, but nothing dramatic. No blood, I don’t think. Not that I’ve noticed. I don’t go poking around in there, you understand. It’s not polite. And honestly, at my age, my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. So, if there was something… well, I probably wouldn’t see it. Is it supposed to smell different, too? I don’t pay much attention to smells these days. My wife usually handles all that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Segretto. You’re not expected to be a medical expert! I just ask because changes in color, smell, or any unusual aspects of your urine can sometimes be clues. No blood, no noticeable change in smell—that's good to know. Let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that’s a question. My wife handles all the doctor’s appointments, you see. She keeps track of all that paperwork. I go along for the ride, mostly. I think I had a bit of high blood pressure once, a long time ago. They put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I don’t like taking pills. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I enjoy a sweet treat now and then, but I’m not a sugary man. I’m a… a hearty eater, if anything. Mostly potatoes and cabbage. Good, solid Ukrainian food. My wife keeps telling me to watch my salt, but… well, a little salt never hurt anyone. Do you follow? I'm healthy enough for an old man, I suppose. Still get around the farm. Though not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of high blood pressure in the past, off medication now, and no known diabetes. We’ll make a note of that. And good, solid Ukrainian food is excellent! Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgeries… Now that you mention it, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago, of course. Before the war, it was. And… oh, I had a bit of trouble with my prostate, maybe ten, fifteen years ago? They… I don’t rightly recall what they did, something with a… tube. It wasn't pleasant. Had to stay in the hospital for a few days. But that was a long time ago. Nothing recently. I haven't been inside a hospital in years, and I hope to keep it that way. It's not a cheerful place, you know. Full of… sick people. Not my idea of a good time. Does that help? I don't remember much about it all, honestly. My wife would know more details. She has a better memory than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy as a boy and a procedure on your prostate ten to fifteen years ago. We'll note that as well. Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. That’s a tough one. My family… well, they didn’t talk much about their ailments. Old country people, you know. Stiff upper lip, that sort of thing. My father… he lived a long life, healthy as an ox until the very end. Just… stopped one day. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. Several siblings, all gone now. Most of them died of old age, I suppose. Nothing… striking. No cancers, no… special diseases. Just… old age. It’s what gets us all in the end, isn't it? I don’t recall anyone having trouble with… the bladder, either. No. Nothing like what I’m experiencing. My wife might know more. She’s the family historian, really. I just… lived it. Do you follow? It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I do, perfectly. No significant family history of similar issues or major diseases. Now, just a couple more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything my wife puts in front of me. She’s a good cook, and I’m not one to be picky. Never had a reaction to any pills, either. Although I don't take many, as I said. I did get stung by a bee once, when I was a boy, but that just hurt. Didn't swell up or anything. Nothing serious. No hay fever, no dust allergies, nothing like that. I’m a fairly robust man, all things considered. I’ve lived a long life, outdoors, in all sorts of weather. Built up a bit of immunity, I suppose. My wife always tells me I'm too stubborn to be allergic to anything. Does that help? I’m fairly certain I don’t have any allergies, but I’m not one to worry about such things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. I used to take a little something for my blood pressure, but I stopped, as I said. Sometimes, if my knee is acting up, I take a little ibuprofen. Just when it’s really bad. Nothing regular. And… oh, sometimes my wife gives me a little herbal tea, for my digestion. Some Ukrainian recipe, I think. It tastes awful, but she swears it helps. But that’s it. No pills, no regular supplements. I’m not a fan of all those fancy medications. I prefer to let nature take its course, as much as possible. I’m a simple man, you see. I don’t need a lot of… fuss. Does that help? I’m fairly certain that’s everything. I don’t take much, if anything. I just try to stay active and eat good food. That’s my secret.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, that’s very helpful. So, to summarize, you've had increasing frequency of urination for roughly three to four months, with a constant nagging sensation rather than a sudden urge, incomplete emptying, a weak stream, no blood or change in urine smell, a history of high blood pressure in the past , a prostate procedure ten to fifteen years ago, no known allergies, and minimal medication use. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological exam. Then I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A… digital rectal exam, you say? Well now. That doesn’t sound very pleasant. Is it… necessary? I mean, I've already told you everything I know. I'm an old man, Doctor. I’ve had my share of… examinations. But that one… that one sounds particularly… intrusive. Can’t you just… give me a pill or something? I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just an old man’s bladder, you know? Still, if you insist… I suppose I can’t refuse. But I'm warning you, Doctor, I’m not a fan of poking around in there. Just be quick about it, alright? And… gentle. Please. It’s not a very dignified position, you see. And I’m a proud man.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto, and I apologize if it sounds unpleasant. It is a standard part of evaluating prostate health, especially given your history and symptoms. It allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate and check for any abnormalities. It's important to rule out any concerning issues. I assure you, I will be as gentle and quick as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. We can stop at any time if you are uncomfortable. Would you prefer to lie on your side, or bend over on the examination table?
PATIENT: Hmm. Lie on my side, I think. That sounds… less exposed. And perhaps a little more… dignified. Bending over… well, that’s just asking for trouble, isn't it? I’m not as flexible as I used to be. Yes, on my side, please. And… maybe a blanket? Just… for modesty. I appreciate you explaining it all, Doctor. I still don't like it, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… be quick about it, alright? And gentle. Remember gentle. And perhaps a word or two to distract me? Tell me about the weather, or… Ukrainian history. Anything to take my mind off it. Just… let's get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. We'll do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. We have a blanket here, and I will explain each step as I go. I can definitely talk about the weather—it's been a rather warm summer—or we can discuss Ukrainian history if you'd like. I’m rather fascinated by it. If you could lie on your left side, with your knees bent towards your chest, that would be perfect. I’ll adjust the blanket for your comfort. Alright, let me know when you're ready, and we'll proceed. I’ll be right beside you throughout the entire exam. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, I think… I think I’m ready. Just… get it over with, alright? And… please, Doctor, be gentle. And… tell me about the weather. Anything to distract me. It's been rather warm, you say? Too warm for farming, if you ask me. The crops are suffering. But don't let me bother you with my troubles. Just… get on with it, shall we? And… please, remember gentle. It's a sensitive area, you understand. An old man’s pride, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. Absolutely. And I completely understand. It is a sensitive area, and I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. You're right, it has been unusually warm this summer. We’ve had a few brief showers, but not nearly enough for the crops. I was reading about the impact on the local farms just this morning. It's concerning. I’m just going to insert a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, I’m finished now. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. It’s not alarmingly enlarged, but it’s large enough to potentially contribute to your urinary symptoms. There is no blood on my glove, which is good. I also checked the muscles of your rectum, which feel normal. Overall, it's not a concerning exam, but your symptoms and the size of your prostate warrant further investigation. I'd like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA test will measure the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can help us assess your risk of prostate problems.)
PATIENT: Well. That wasn’t pleasant, but I suppose it’s done. Enlarged, you say? Not alarmingly so, thankfully. I’m glad to hear there was no blood. A urine analysis and a blood test, you say? More tests. Honestly, Doctor, I’m getting tired of tests. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can’t refuse. What exactly does this PSA test measure? And what would a high level mean? I don’t want to worry about things unnecessarily. I’m an old man, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t want to spend my remaining years worrying about… prostate problems. Just tell me straight, alright? Is it serious? Or is it just… an old man’s bladder? And when can I have that cup of tea? All this talk about tests and prostates is making me thirsty.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto, and I assure you, we're not jumping to conclusions. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. PSA is a protein produced by the prostate gland. A higher level can indicate a possible problem with the prostate, such as inflammation, infection, or even prostate cancer. However, it’s important to remember that a high PSA level doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many things can cause PSA levels to rise, including age, inflammation, and even recent sexual activity. That’s why we need to do further testing to determine the cause of your elevated PSA. We’ll also review your urine analysis results to rule out any infection. To be honest, Mr. Segretto, your symptoms and the size of your prostate do warrant further investigation, but I don’t want you to worry unnecessarily. It could be something as simple as benign prostatic hyperplasia—an enlarged prostate that is not cancerous. We’ll get the test results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, you can definitely have that cup of tea. And I’ll order the lab tests right away. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Benign… what did you call it? That sounds better than cancer, at least. I suppose I can live with that. But I still don’t like it. An old man’s bladder, that’s all it is. Still, I appreciate you being straight with me, Doctor. It's better to know, I suppose, even if it's not good news. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… get those tests done as quickly as possible, alright? And… maybe a little something to help me sleep tonight? All this talk about prostates and tests is giving me a bit of a headache. And… yes, that cup of tea would be lovely. A strong cup, please. And thank you, Doctor. For your time, and for your honesty. I suppose I’ll just have to wait and see, won’t I? It’s not easy being an old man, you know. But what can you do? Alright, I think I’ll be going now. Thank you again, Doctor. And… please, remember my tea. A strong cup. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Segretto. I'll arrange for the lab tests to be done as quickly as possible. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid to help you rest tonight. And I'll make sure the nurse prepares a strong cup of tea for you before you leave. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you a clear diagnosis and the best possible care. Take care, Mr. Segretto. And please, try to relax and get some rest. We’ll talk soon.
