DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's about a letter, actually. I need a note saying it's okay for me to fly. It’s for… well, travel insurance, mostly. They need confirmation from a doctor before they’ll cover anything, you see.
DOCTOR: Travel insurance requiring a physician’s note prior to travel… that’s rather unusual, but certainly not unheard of. I can certainly document your medical fitness to fly. However, a simple statement isn't sufficient medical practice. I need to understand why they require this note. Are you currently under treatment for a medical condition?
PATIENT: Oh, it is unusual, you’re right. It's just… my husband passed away a few months ago. We had a trip planned, a really big one, to Mongolia to visit family. And I… I still want to go. The insurance company is being very strict, saying they need to know if anything could… complicate things mid-flight. I don’t have any ongoing treatments, no. Nothing like that. Just… grief, I suppose. But they want a doctor's say-so anyway. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: I see. A trip planned prior to a significant loss, and the insurance company’s… overzealous due diligence. Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. While grief itself isn't a medical condition requiring clearance to fly, it can certainly exacerbate pre-existing conditions, or even reveal previously unknown ones. To properly document your fitness for travel, I’ll need a full medical history. Let’s start with past medical issues. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. I've always been… fairly healthy, honestly. A few colds every year, the usual. I broke my arm when I was a kid, badly, but it healed completely. No surgeries beyond that. My family has a history of… well, everyone lives to be quite old, if that’s helpful. Lots of longevity on both sides. I’ve never had any serious hospital stays or anything requiring long-term care. Really, I'm quite fit for my age.
DOCTOR: Longevity in the family is… encouraging. And a lack of significant medical history is, naturally, preferable. However, we still need to be thorough. Let’s discuss medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really try to avoid medication whenever possible. I drink a lot of water, eat reasonably well, try to get enough sleep… that’s about it. No vitamins, no supplements, no pain relievers, nothing. I haven’t even taken an aspirin in months. I really don’t like relying on pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Very well. That simplifies things. Now, allergies. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, insect stings, environmental factors… anything that causes a reaction?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing… nothing. I can eat anything, be anywhere, without worry. My husband always teased me about it, said I was “boring” because I didn’t have any sensitivities.
DOCTOR: That’s… convenient. Alright. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t drink, either. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’ve always been very… careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: I see. A remarkably… disciplined lifestyle. Given your medical history – or, rather, lack thereof – and your social habits, a full physical examination seems… unnecessary, but prudent. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Just a formality, given everything you’ve told me. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this letter so I can… start making plans, you know? It’s been a long few months.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit comfortably. I'll begin with your blood pressure. 120 over 80. Acceptable. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds regular. Lung sounds clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Everything sounds within normal limits. Given your history, physical exam, and lack of allergies or current medications, I can document your medical fitness to fly. However, I must include a caveat regarding potential emotional distress. Long-distance travel following a significant loss can be… challenging. I recommend ensuring you have adequate support systems in place and considering consulting a grief counselor prior to departure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… completely acceptable. I hadn't even thought about it that way, but you’re right. It will be emotionally difficult, I’m sure. I do have family in Mongolia, thankfully. And… I’ve been seeing a therapist here, locally, for a few weeks now. So, yes, that sounds perfect. Can you write the letter now? I really appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will draft a letter stating you are medically fit for air travel, with the aforementioned caveat regarding potential emotional distress and recommendation for continued support. It will also state that you have no known allergies or current medications. Here you are. Please review it carefully to ensure all information is accurate. I’ve included my clinic contact information should the insurance company require further clarification. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, this is perfect! Everything is accurate, thank you so much. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. You’ve been very thorough, and I really appreciate your time and understanding. I think… I think I can finally start making arrangements now. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. Travel safely, Ms. Sayar. And remember to prioritize your emotional wellbeing.
