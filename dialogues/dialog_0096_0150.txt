DOCTOR: Alright, Angelle. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, I don’t have time for this, but my… acquaintance suggested I come. I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I don’t want any… complications.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… sensible, I suppose. A lot of people do leave these things until later. “Easily” is a strong word, dear. But we can certainly look at what’s involved in optimizing your chances of a healthy pregnancy. First, let’s get a bit of background. Have you been trying for a while, or is this more of a… preemptive check-up?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not at all. I haven’t… actively been trying. I just want to know if there’s anything wrong with me that would prevent it from happening quickly. I’m a very healthy woman, you see. I cycle… well, I used to cycle competitively. And I eat very well. Mostly. Don’t you think that should count for something?
DOCTOR: It certainly helps, dear. Being generally healthy is a good start. But fertility is… more complicated than just being fit. We need to understand your cycle, check hormone levels, maybe look at a few other things. Now, you said you used to cycle competitively. When did you stop, and were your cycles regular then?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… about ten years ago now. Perhaps eleven. Competitive cycling is… demanding. Very demanding. And yes, they were regular then. Perfectly regular. Like clockwork. I remember because I had to track everything for… reasons. Training, mostly. But stopping… that threw everything off for a bit. It took a while to normalize. Though I haven't really… paid much attention since. Honestly, I’ve been… preoccupied.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, cycles were regular during intense training, became irregular after stopping, and haven’t been closely monitored since. That gives us something to work with. Can you describe what “irregular” meant back then?
PATIENT: It meant… longer sometimes. Or shorter. Occasionally they would just… not come. For a month, perhaps. It wasn't pleasant. I blamed it on the stress, naturally. And the change in diet. All the pasta. Though I maintained a strict regimen even then. It wasn't… ideal, but I was an athlete, you see. Everything was about performance. I didn’t bother with… feminine things.
DOCTOR: Right. So, amenorrhea – absence of periods – for up to a month at a time after stopping cycling. And you haven’t really tracked things since then?
PATIENT: Ameno… what now? Look, I don't speak doctor. I just mean they stopped sometimes. For a bit. And no, I haven't been keeping a calendar. I have a business to run, you know. Bicycle repairs don’t fix themselves. I’m not a young woman anymore, I don’t have time for… charting. Is there a test I can take that will tell me if I’m able to have a child or not? Because that would be the most efficient solution.
DOCTOR: There are tests we can do, yes. But “able to have a child or not” is a bit… simplistic, dear. We need to understand why your cycles might be irregular, and what that means for your fertility. We'll start with a blood test to check your hormone levels—things like FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone. Those will give us a good starting point. And I’d like to do a pelvic exam as well. Just to rule out anything obvious. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m Hungarian, we’re a sturdy people. We don’t have allergies. Although, I do have a… sensitivity to incompetence. Is that a medical condition? And a pelvic exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? It seems… intrusive. I’m a respectable businesswoman, not some… fragile flower.
DOCTOR: “Sensitivity to incompetence” is… not something we list on the allergy form, dear. And yes, a pelvic exam is standard procedure when evaluating fertility. It allows me to assess the health of your reproductive organs. It’s not about fragility; it’s about gathering information. Look, I understand your concerns, but I need to perform a thorough examination to give you the best possible care. If you’re truly committed to this, you’ll need to allow me to do my job. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in poisoning my body with chemicals. I take vitamins, of course. Multivitamins. And occasionally… a little paprika. For the circulation. It’s a Hungarian secret. But that’s it. I thought you were going to ask about, you know, serious things. Like… infections. Or… whatever it is women get. Not vitamins.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we will certainly rule out any infections as part of the examination. That's standard. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My mother… she had a difficult time, let’s just say. Many, many miscarriages. It was… a sad time. My grandmother, on the other hand, had… thirteen children. Thirteen! Can you imagine? Though she was always exhausted. And my sister… well, she had twins. Identical twins. So, you see. It’s a bit of a… mixed bag. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. History of miscarriages on your mother’s side, multiple pregnancies on your sister’s side… It gives us some context. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! I used to be a competitive athlete, remember? Smoking is… barbaric. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A dry Riesling, preferably. And a little pálinka when my acquaintance comes to visit. It’s… festive. But that’s it. I lead a very… disciplined life, despite what you might think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Moderate alcohol consumption. Good. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. I’ll need you to change into a gown, and we'll start with a basic check of your height and weight, then proceed with the pelvic exam. I’ll explain everything as we go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is taking far too long. But if it must be done. Is there… a quicker way? I have a bicycle to repair. A very important bicycle. And I really didn’t plan on… all this. A gown? Fine. But please be quick about it. And try not to… poke around too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Angelle. I assure you, I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. The exam is necessary to get a clear picture of your health and identify any potential issues. The examination room is just down the hall. There’s a private changing area. I’ll give you a few moments to change, and I'll be right back to begin. Please let me know if you have any discomfort during the exam, and we can pause at any time. I'll be just outside.
PATIENT: Fine. But I expect a thorough explanation of everything afterward. And quickly. I haven’t got all day.
