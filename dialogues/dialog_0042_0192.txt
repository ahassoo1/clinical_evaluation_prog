DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too, I guess. Look, I'm here 'cause I gotta get this exam done. For the army. They want it, so I'm gettin' it done. Seems like a lot of fuss over nothin', honestly. But here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A required exam for the army. We want to make sure everything is in order for you, and I'm happy to help get this completed. So, besides the requirement for the army, are you experiencing any specific health concerns or symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Health concerns? No. I feel… fine. As fine as a man my age can be, anyway. I work with engines all day, keeps me busy. Strong back, good hands. No time for bein’ sick, gotta provide for the family, you know? What kinda questions are these anyway? Is this about bein' healthy healthy or just makin' sure I don’t fall apart during training?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're feeling generally well. And you’re right to ask – it's both, really. The army has certain standards we need to meet, and we also want to get a good baseline of your overall health. It’s helpful to know what's 'normal' for you, so we can track changes if any arise. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmph. Not much to tell, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell outta a tree. Doctor set it, it healed. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox… mother made me drink some awful tea for those, don’t remember much. Never been seriously sick, never had any operations. Mostly just bumps and bruises from work. I don't bother with doctors unless somethin’ is really broken. Waste of time, if you ask me. Is this gonna take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm as a child and the usual childhood illnesses. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s very helpful to know. And I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Hartness. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Now, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Chronic… what now? Look, I told you, I don’t go to doctors. I haven't been diagnosed with nothin’. I eat okay, maybe a bit too much pork, but it builds character. Blood pressure? Is that somethin’ bad? My father had somethin’ with his heart, years ago, but he smoked like a chimney. I don’t smoke. Honestly, this feels like you’re tryin' to find somethin' wrong with me.
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels that way, Mr. Hartness. It's not my intention to find something wrong; it's simply part of a thorough evaluation to make sure you’re in good health and meet the army's requirements. And yes, high blood pressure can be something to keep an eye on, and knowing your family history is very helpful. Since you mentioned your father’s heart condition, do you know what he was diagnosed with specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Somethin' with his heart, like I said. He was a stubborn old man. Never went to the doctor unless he was practically dead. Muttered somethin’ about 'weakness'. They told my mother it was somethin' to do with… clogged arteries, maybe? But she didn’t understand a word of it, and I certainly didn't bother askin'. He smoked like a factory, drank too much coffee, and worked himself to the bone. Not a good example, really. This is all a waste of time, you know. They just want to make sure I can't do somethin' they don't want me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A history of heart problems in the father, possibly related to smoking, with no specific diagnosis known. And I appreciate your honesty about your concerns. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Don't take nothin'. Never needed to. Vitamins? Sometimes my wife gives me some orange chewable ones, but I forget to take ‘em half the time. Supplements? What for? I eat food. Real food. Look, I build engines, I don’t sit around swallowin’ pills all day. I’m a practical man. Next question. This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, occasional vitamins, and no supplements. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I’m Swedish, we’re tough. Maybe a bit sensitive to the cold sometimes, but that's just bein’ sensible. No rashes, no sneezin', no swellin'. Nothing like that. Honestly, this feels like you're checkin' if I'm an alien or somethin'. Just get on with it, alright? What tests are you gonna do? Are they gonna hurt? I got a bad back, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you are definitely not an alien, Mr. Hartness! I assure you, these are standard questions to get a complete picture of your health. We will start with some basic physical measurements—height, weight, blood pressure, and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. We will also do a quick exam of your vision and reflexes, and I'd like to take a blood sample for routine testing. The blood draw is the only part that might cause a slight pinch, but it’s very quick. The physical exam itself shouldn’t cause any pain. Do you have any concerns about the blood draw, considering your back?
PATIENT: A blood draw, huh? Always somethin’. My back… it gets stiff sometimes, especially after a long day bendin’ over engines. I can handle it, I guess, but I don't want you pokin’ around too much. And make it quick, alright? I got things to do, remember? This whole process is takin’ forever. What exactly are you lookin' for in the blood, anyway? Just tell me, so I know what you’re tryin’ to find. Don't bother with fancy words, just plain English.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it slow and be gentle with your back. And you’re right to ask what we’re looking for. The blood test checks for things like your red and white blood cell count – to see if you're healthy and not fighting an infection – your blood sugar to check for diabetes, and your cholesterol levels to assess your heart health. We’ll also look at your kidney and liver function. It's just a general overview to make sure everything is working as it should. First, let’s get your height and weight. Then we'll check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. Height and weight, you said? I'm a big guy. Always have been. Strong build, like I told you. Just don’t make me stand on one leg or anything, my back won't appreciate that. And hurry it up, alright? I'm losin' daylight. Let’s get this done. I got a workshop waitin’. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. No balancing, I promise. Please step onto the scale when you’re ready. And I’ll work as quickly as I can. Okay, you are 187 centimeters and 53 kilograms. Now, if you’ll just sit here, I’ll check your blood pressure. It’s a simple cuff around your arm, no discomfort involved.
