DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, Chellsea. To clarify, you were recently informed of a cancer diagnosis and were referred to me for follow-up?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A few weeks ago, they told me. It was… a shock. I’m still trying to understand everything, honestly. I don’t really know what kind it is or what happens next.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand that. It's a lot to process. We'll go through everything step-by-step. Do you happen to recall which type of cancer you were told you have?
PATIENT: I… I think they said something about… ovarian? But I was so upset, it’s hard to remember clearly. And there were a lot of other words I didn’t understand. It was a woman doctor who told me, at the hospital.
DOCTOR: Ovarian cancer, okay. It's common to feel overwhelmed when receiving such news, and it’s perfectly alright if you don't recall all the details. We can review your records from the hospital to confirm the specific diagnosis and staging. Just to be thorough, do you have any paperwork from the hospital visit – discharge summaries, pathology reports, anything like that – that you brought with you today?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I brought a folder with everything they gave me. Here. I hope it has everything. I wasn't sure what was important.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is very helpful. Let me take a few minutes to review these reports... Alright, it appears here we have the pathology report confirming a diagnosis of Stage 1A serous ovarian cancer. It also details the surgical findings from the hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy performed on July 15th. Do you recall the surgery?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It was… painful for a while afterwards, but I’m feeling better now. They said they removed… everything. Is that what “hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy” means? I’m sorry, I really don’t know a lot of these terms.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Chellsea. It's my job to explain these things. A hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus, and a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the removal of both fallopian tubes and ovaries. So, yes, it means those organs have been removed. Given the Stage 1A diagnosis, this suggests the cancer was very early stage and confined to the ovaries. Now, the next step is to determine if any further treatment is necessary. Have they discussed any treatment options with you yet, such as chemotherapy?
PATIENT: They mentioned something about it, but I was… scared. I didn’t really listen closely. Something about… after the surgery, to make sure it’s all gone? I just remember it sounded… harsh. I’m not sure I want to do anything harsh. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Chellsea. Chemotherapy can be daunting, and it's perfectly valid to feel apprehensive. We certainly don't want to proceed with any treatment you're not comfortable with. Based on the pathology report, the cancer was serous and Stage 1A. Typically, for Stage 1A serous ovarian cancer, observation may be an option, but we would need to discuss the potential risks and benefits of that versus adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy is chemotherapy given after surgery to reduce the risk of recurrence. To help me understand your concerns better, can you tell me what specifically makes you feel uneasy about chemotherapy?
PATIENT: It's… everything I’ve heard. People getting sick, losing their hair, being really weak. My grandmother had cancer a long time ago, and she was so sick during her treatments. I don't want to be like that. I just want to… get back to normal. Is that possible, even with the cancer?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Chellsea, and it’s good you’re thinking about these things. Your grandmother's experience certainly shapes your perspective. Chemotherapy treatments have advanced significantly over the years, and the side effects are often much more manageable now. We have excellent medications to help with nausea, fatigue, and other common side effects. However, you’re right to consider all options. Given your Stage 1A diagnosis, we could discuss surveillance – meaning regular check-ups and imaging scans to monitor for any signs of recurrence – as a possible alternative. To determine the best course of action, I'd like to order some blood work, including a CA-125 test, which is a tumor marker often elevated in ovarian cancer. We can also review your family history in more detail. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything before, as far as I know. My mother always handled my medical stuff, and I didn't pay much attention to details. I just… trusted her. But no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Is that okay? I hope that’s enough information.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. We can certainly proceed with that information. It’s common for patients to not have a detailed medication allergy history readily available. We can always document “no known drug allergies” for now. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t really have much of one. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I don’t take any regular medicines, and I haven’t been in the hospital since the surgery. I eat… okay. I try to, anyway. I used to be a lot more active, but… things have been hard since my husband passed away. I’ve lost a lot of weight.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that your health and activity level have been affected. So, to summarize, no significant past medical history, no regular medications, and no known allergies. You mentioned some weight loss; approximately how much weight have you lost, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: About twenty pounds, I think. Maybe a little more. It started after… after the funeral. I just didn't have much of an appetite. Everything felt… pointless. It’s been about six months, I guess. It’s hard to keep track of time. It feels like a long time, but also like yesterday. I try to eat, but it's hard. I just don't feel hungry. Is that something I should worry about?
DOCTOR: That is something we should address, Chellsea. Losing twenty pounds unintentionally over six months, especially in the context of grief, is concerning. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes, and also to assess for any signs of depression. We’ll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and the CA-125 test, as we discussed. We’ll also do a physical exam. Would you be comfortable if I briefly screened you for symptoms of depression, just to get a better understanding of how you’re coping?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. I feel sad, of course. But isn’t that normal, after losing someone? I don’t want to be labeled as… something. I just want to feel better, and get this cancer thing taken care of. I don’t want more problems. But I guess… if it helps, okay. But please, don't make it a big deal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Chellsea. It's not about labeling you, it’s about ensuring you have the support you need. It's very common to experience grief after a loss, and it's important to differentiate between normal grieving and something more that might require additional support. It's a very brief questionnaire, and the results will simply help me understand how you’re coping and determine if further evaluation is needed. First, let’s just do a quick physical exam, and then we can proceed with the questionnaire. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. The physical exam first. I guess… just get it over with. I just want to know what’s going on. And then maybe we can talk about the tests. What will those tests show? Will they tell me if the cancer is gone?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll start with the physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your lymph nodes. This will give us a baseline assessment. The blood work, including the CA-125 test, can give us an indication of your overall health and whether there's any evidence of active cancer. A high CA-125 level can suggest the presence of cancer, but it’s not always definitive. It can be elevated in other conditions as well. The complete blood count and metabolic panel will help us rule out other possible causes for your weight loss and fatigue. The goal is to gather as much information as possible to guide our treatment decisions. Let’s begin. If you could please lie down on the examination table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Okay. Just… please be gentle. Everything feels… sensitive.
DOCTOR: I will be, Chellsea. I'll proceed slowly and be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Do you feel any particular tenderness in your abdomen when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that hurts a little. Right there, on the left side. It’s not… sharp, exactly. Just… sore. Like a bruise, maybe? It’s been like that for a few weeks, I think. I just thought it was from the surgery. But… it doesn’t seem to be getting better.
DOCTOR: I see. That's good information to have, Chellsea. I'm noting that you have tenderness in your lower left quadrant. It's possible this is related to the surgical site, or it could be something else we need to investigate further. I'm going to palpate your lymph nodes now, just to check for any swelling. Do you feel any lumps or swelling in these areas?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I don’t feel anything unusual. My neck feels normal, and… my armpits and… down there. Everything feels… okay. But… I’m starting to feel a little nervous. What are you looking for? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It's good that I don’t feel any obvious swelling in your lymph nodes, Chellsea. I’m just performing a thorough examination to get a complete picture of your health. It’s standard procedure. Right now, based on the physical exam, you have some tenderness in your lower left abdomen. The blood work will help us understand the cause of that tenderness and rule out any other potential issues. To summarize, we’ve discussed your medical history, surgical history, your weight loss, and the tenderness in your abdomen. We're going to order the CBC, CMP and CA-125. Before we proceed, is there anything else you would like to tell me or ask me?
PATIENT: Um… no, I don’t think so. I guess… just the tests. And… hopefully they’ll tell me something. I just want to know what’s going on. And… thank you for being gentle. I really appreciate that. I’m just… scared. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely okay to say, Chellsea. It’s perfectly normal to be scared, and I completely understand. That’s why I’m here – to listen, to help you understand, and to guide you through this process. I’ll write up the orders for the blood work now, and the lab technician will come in shortly to draw the samples. We should have the results back within a few business days. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or nausea – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything I can do to make you feel more comfortable before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. Just… getting the tests done. And knowing you'll be here to explain them. That helps. Thank you, Doctor. Really. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I’m glad I could help, even a little. I will be here, and we will go through the results together. I’ll have the lab technician come in shortly. .
