DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 31 years old. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. I’m here because… well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump in the lower abdomen, you say. And how long, precisely, has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe a little more? It didn’t bother me at first, it was quite small. But it seems to have grown a bit recently, and that’s what made me decide to come in.
DOCTOR: Three months, growing recently… I see. And can you describe the lump for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… hard. Not painful to the touch, exactly, but it’s definitely firm. It’s maybe the size of a walnut now? Roundish, I suppose. It doesn’t feel… squishy, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. I haven't noticed any changes in my skin around it, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Firm, walnut-sized, no skin changes... Right. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing that I’ve connected to it, anyway. No pain, no fever, no… changes in my bathroom habits, if you don’t mind me saying. Just the lump. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Perfectly healthy otherwise… That's good to hear, in a way. Let’s move on to some general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any prior surgeries or significant medical illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve been quite lucky, health-wise. Just the usual childhood things, I suppose – chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing major. No surgeries at all. I’m married, if that’s relevant, and otherwise keep fairly active.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or significant medical history. Alright. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My father had high blood pressure, and my mother… she had some stomach issues when she was older, but nothing specific that I know of. No history of cancer on either side of the family, as far as I'm aware. We don’t have a lot of medical records going back generations, to be honest.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, some stomach issues… Adequate. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. My wife teases me about it, says I have an iron stomach! No reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past, as far as I can remember. I haven't taken anything regularly for a while now though, just the occasional pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to perform a physical examination now, if you would be so kind. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with palpating your abdomen, to get a better sense of this lump.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position at any point.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat. I'm going to begin by gently pressing on your abdomen. Try to relax as much as possible. Now, can you tell me if you feel any tenderness in any particular area as I press?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m trying to relax. Ooh, that’s a little tender… right there. Just below my belly button, on the right side. It’s not painful, but I can definitely feel something. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Right there… yes. It’s moderately tender. I'm palpating a firm, roughly 2x2 centimeter mass. It appears to be fixed, meaning it doesn’t easily move beneath my fingers. No rebound tenderness, thankfully. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. Alright. Based on this initial examination, we'll need further investigation to determine the cause of this mass. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Doctor. An ultrasound, you said? Will that tell you much? I’m a little worried, if I’m honest. Is it something serious, do you think? I know you haven’t had a chance to properly look yet, but… any initial thoughts?
DOCTOR: Mr. Raghunathan, it's premature to speculate without the results of the investigations. An ultrasound will provide us with a visual assessment of the mass, allowing us to determine its characteristics – its size, shape, and composition. It will help us differentiate between a solid mass and a fluid-filled cyst, for example. Worrying accomplishes nothing. We are proceeding methodically, and that is the appropriate course of action. I will schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. The results will be available within 24 hours, and we can then discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not… just a little anxious, that’s all. Tomorrow morning, you said. That’s fine. I’ll make sure I’m fasting, if necessary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. Is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any specific symptoms that would warrant a call to the clinic?
DOCTOR: Fasting is not required. Monitor for any significant changes in pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any alterations in your bowel habits. Should you experience severe abdominal pain, bleeding, or feel generally unwell, please contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, simply maintain your normal routine and await the results of the ultrasound. I will have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment once we have those results. Now, do try not to self-diagnose, Mr. Raghunathan. It rarely leads to helpful conclusions.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I understand. No self-diagnosing, I promise. Thank you again for your time. I'll see you tomorrow, then. And thank you for scheduling the appointment. I’ll try to remain calm. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Raghunathan. .
