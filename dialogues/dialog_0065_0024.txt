DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s a bit of a strange request, I think. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. An airline needs it.
DOCTOR: A letter stating you’re able to fly?
PATIENT: Yes. My husband… he passed away a few months ago. We had a trip planned, already paid for, to visit my sister in Mongolia. The airline is being…difficult about the refund, and they said if I could get a doctor’s note saying I am physically able to travel, they might reconsider. It's a long story, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the airline believes a medical statement regarding your ability to travel will influence their refund decision. While I typically provide notes related to a patient’s fitness for specific medical procedures or work restrictions, a general “able to fly” letter is…unconventional. However, I understand you’ve already incurred expenses. Let's clarify a few things. Aside from the emotional distress of your loss, are you experiencing any physical symptoms that would prevent you from taking a long flight?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I feel…fine, physically. A little tired, naturally, but who isn't? And it’s been a few months now. I've been keeping up with my routine, walking, eating okay. I don’t have any heart problems, or lung issues, or anything like that. I just…need the letter.
DOCTOR: I see your height and weight are within a normal range, and your Medicare record doesn’t indicate any major pre-existing conditions. Still, for documentation purposes, I need to perform a brief physical exam. Standard procedure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and briefly assess your overall neurological function. It shouldn't take long. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. The quicker we get this done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table, and I’ll begin. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 128/76. That’s within normal limits. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall neurological assessment appears unremarkable. I’ve documented my findings. Now, while this isn’t standard practice, given the unusual nature of the request and the absence of any contraindications, I can draft a letter stating that you are physically capable of undertaking air travel as of today's date. However, it’s important to understand this letter does not address any psychological factors that may influence your ability to travel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. That’s… perfectly fine. I don’t need anything about psychological factors, just that I can physically go. Thank you. Will it be ready quickly? I really appreciate you doing this for me.
DOCTOR: Here you are. It states you are medically cleared for air travel as of August 2nd, 2025, based on a brief physical examination performed today. I’ve included my contact information should the airline require further clarification. Please review it. And Ms. Sayar, while I've accommodated your request, I must reiterate that this is not a typical medical assessment. If you experience any symptoms during travel, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No, that’s… that’s perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Duplichan. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. I think this will solve the whole problem. I don’t have any other questions. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Should you need anything further, don't hesitate to contact my office. Have a…safe trip, Ms. Sayar. .
