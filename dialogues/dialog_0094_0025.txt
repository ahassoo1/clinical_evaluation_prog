DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice meet you too. I… want to know ‘bout my family. Long time ago, you know? I hear you can… find things out with… spit? Or blood? Something like that. I wanna know where I come from, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Scobie, I understand. You’re interested in learning more about your ancestry, your family history, and where your roots are. You’ve heard about using genetic testing – that’s likely what you’re referring to with the “spit” or “blood” test. It’s a relatively new field, but it can often provide helpful information. Before we talk about genetic testing specifically, though, let’s talk about what you know about your family. Sometimes, we can uncover a lot just by talking through the history. Would you mind starting with what you remember about your parents, grandparents, and where they were from originally?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good. Talking is good. My mama… she from Marshall Islands, of course. Lots of family there. My papa… that’s hard. He… work on boats, long time ago. American boats. He didn’t talk much ‘bout before. Just… come to Majuro, then me. He gone now, long time. Grandparents… Mama tell stories. But I forget. Old man, you know? Islands… far away. That’s all I really know. Sorry. Is spit test okay still?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Scobie. It’s very common for family stories to fade over time, and it’s perfectly understandable that you’ve forgotten some details. It sounds like your mother was from the Marshall Islands, and your father came to Majuro after working on American boats. That’s a good starting point. The “spit test,” as you call it – that’s a saliva sample for genetic testing – is an option, and it can often provide information about your ancestry, ethnicity, and potential relatives. However, it’s important to understand what it can and cannot tell us. It’s not always perfectly accurate, and the results can sometimes be complex to interpret. Before we order a test, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your health history, just to make sure it's appropriate for you. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical? Not much. I get… tired sometimes. Old age, you know? Doctor give me pills for… pressure. High pressure, he say. And… sometimes my legs hurt. But that’s just walking, I think. I don’t go hospital much. Just the small clinic in town. They give me the pills. That’s all. Is pressure okay for test? I worry ‘bout things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you experience some fatigue, you take medication for high blood pressure, and you have some leg pain, likely related to walking. That’s helpful information, thank you. Generally, high blood pressure itself shouldn't prevent you from having a genetic test, but how well controlled it is is important. Also, the medications you take could sometimes interfere with the testing process, though it’s usually not a major issue. I want to be sure we're being cautious. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think… The little white pill. It start with… an ‘A’. Amlodipine? Is that right? The doctor, he write it on the paper. I give it to the pharmacy, they give me the pills. I don’t remember much else. They know, you know? The pharmacy. Is that okay for the test, you think? I really want to know ‘bout my family.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That's a common medication for high blood pressure. And it’s good you're taking it as prescribed! Amlodipine shouldn’t directly interfere with the genetic test, but it's important that the lab is aware you’re taking it. Okay, Mr. Scobie, so to summarize: you’re interested in genetic testing to learn more about your ancestry, you take Amlodipine for high blood pressure, and you experience some fatigue and leg pain. Before we proceed with ordering the test, I want to make sure you understand what the test can and cannot tell you. It can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins, identify potential relatives, and sometimes offer clues about your family’s migration patterns. However, it won’t tell you everything, and the results may not always be definitive. It also won’t diagnose any medical conditions. Are you comfortable with those limitations?
PATIENT: Hmm… no medical? Good. I don’t want medical. Just… family. I understand. Not perfect. Just… a clue. A little bit. Like… finding a piece of a puzzle. That’s okay. I just… want to know where I come from, really. Where my papa come from. Is okay, even if it’s just a little piece. You think it can help with that? Even just a little?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Scobie, I absolutely think it can help, even if it’s just a little piece. It sounds like your primary goal is to learn more about your father’s origins, and that’s a perfectly reasonable goal. The test may be able to provide clues about his ethnic background or identify potential relatives who could share more information. Okay, let’s go ahead and order the test. We'll use a company called [Company Name - I am omitting a specific company name for ethical considerations]. They have a good reputation for accuracy and customer support. They'll send you a kit with instructions on how to collect a saliva sample, and then you'll mail it back to their lab. It usually takes about 4-6 weeks to get the results. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Four to six weeks… okay. Long time, but okay. If it help find a piece… I can wait. Send the kit, then. I will… try to spit good. And mail it back. You think I will get paper with… names? Or… maps? Something like that? I hope it show me where my papa come from. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm happy to help. The results typically include an estimate of your ethnic origins, presented as percentages. It may also show you potential relatives who have also used the service, along with their geographic locations. Sometimes, they will provide information about historical migration patterns related to your ethnic groups, which could include maps. It's not always a direct answer – it's often more like piecing together a puzzle, as you said. I'm printing out the consent form and the instructions for collecting the sample now. Please read the consent form carefully before signing it. It explains the risks and limitations of the test in detail. Once you’ve signed it, you can mail it back with the sample. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the process itself before you get started?
PATIENT: No, I think okay. Paperwork… I can read. Slowly, but I can read. You explain good. Just… send the kit, then. I will do the spit. And wait. Thank you again, Doctor. You very kind lady. I hope it find a piece. That's all I want. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’ve sent the order for the kit, and it should arrive in a few days. I truly hope it helps you find some answers. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns during the process. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
