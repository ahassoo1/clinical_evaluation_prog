DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, honestly. I just... I want to have a baby, okay? And I want it to be easy. My first one… well, it wasn’t. I don’t want any trouble this time. Is that what you fix? Making sure things work the first time?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a smooth pregnancy and delivery, especially after a difficult first experience. I specialize in Internal Medicine, and while I don’t directly handle fertility treatments or deliveries, I can certainly help assess your overall health to optimize your chances of a healthy pregnancy and identify any potential issues that might make things more difficult. We can work together to make sure you're in the best possible condition. To start, could you tell me a little more about your first pregnancy?
PATIENT: Ugh, details. Honestly, it was years ago, and I try not to dwell. It was... complicated. Lots of tests. I was really sick the whole time, morning sickness that never ended. And then… it was just a long labor. Very long. I just want to skip all that this time around. I’m not looking to relive any of it. Was it even a healthy pregnancy? I don't really remember. They just… gave me a baby at the end. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Carmaleta. It’s very common to want to put difficult experiences behind you. And it is helpful – it tells me you've been through a challenging pregnancy and are understandably anxious about repeating it. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I accessed your electronic health records?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just… hurry it up, please? I have things to do. I suppose if you need them, go ahead. Just don’t expect a lot of details. Like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be. And honestly, doctor’s appointments back then were… a blur. They all kind of run together.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, it looks like I have some records from St. Jude's Hospital dating back to 2018. It confirms a full-term pregnancy and delivery of a healthy baby girl, as you mentioned. There are notes regarding severe hyperemesis gravidarum – that's the medical term for extreme morning sickness – and a prolonged labor with eventual vacuum assistance. It also notes some mild pre-eclampsia – high blood pressure during pregnancy – that was managed. Given this history, it would be helpful to understand your current health status. Have you had any medical conditions diagnosed since the birth of your daughter?
PATIENT: Ugh, pre-eclampsia… that sounds awful. Look, I’ve been… fine. Mostly. I had a scare a few years back – felt really tired all the time, they said something about my iron being low. They gave me pills for it. And… I think my blood pressure was a little high at one point, but it went down. I don't really follow these things closely. I just go to the doctor when something hurts. Honestly, it's all a bit of a haze. Is it really necessary to go through all this? I just want to make sure this next pregnancy doesn't turn into a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Carmaleta. It is important information though, and we're just trying to build a complete picture. The previous iron deficiency and elevated blood pressure are relevant, as they can sometimes indicate a predisposition to certain complications. To clarify, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think… I take a multivitamin, I guess. And sometimes I take something for headaches, if they’re really bad. Ibuprofen, I think? The normal stuff you get at the pharmacy. Oh, and I used to take something for my stomach, when it was bothering me, but I stopped. It didn’t really help, anyway. Honestly, I'm not a big pill person. I prefer to just… deal with things. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Carmaleta. It's good to know what you're currently taking, even if it's occasional. Ibuprofen is an NSAID, and while generally safe, we do recommend avoiding them later in pregnancy. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or pregnancy complications?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Honestly, nobody ever really talked about these things. My mother had… something with her blood pressure, I think. She was always complaining about it. And… my aunt, on my father’s side, had diabetes, I think. But she lived in Ghana, so it was… different back then. They didn’t really have good doctors, you know? I’m not sure what else. Honestly, I don’t want to dredge up old family stories. It’s depressing. Does it really matter? I just want a healthy baby. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Carmaleta. Family history can sometimes be difficult to uncover. Even a little information can be helpful, so thank you for sharing what you recall. Knowing about your mother’s blood pressure and your aunt’s diabetes gives us a slightly better picture. Finally, let's talk briefly about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
