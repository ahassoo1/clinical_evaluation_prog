DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I'm Dr. Roseburroborough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, I’m here because… frankly, I’ve heard things are changing. And my daughter, bless her heart, thinks I should look into this medical marijuana business. Said it might help with… well, the aches and pains. Not that I need anything, mind you, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive, and it’s thoughtful of your daughter to look into options for you. So, just to clarify, you’re interested in learning more about medical marijuana for pain management, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's precisely what I said. Though, I must say, I find it a bit… peculiar. I’ve always managed just fine without resorting to… that. But apparently, one can get a “certification” now. My daughter said you’re the one to see. Is this a lengthy process? I have bridge club this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It is becoming more common, and yes, you've come to the right place. We can certainly discuss it. It doesn't have to be lengthy at all. First, I'd like to understand the nature of your aches and pains a little better. Could you tell me where you're experiencing pain, and how long you’ve been having it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where don’t I have aches and pains? It’s the years, you see. Years of… living. Mostly in my knees, though. And my lower back. It flares up with the weather, you know? Damp days are the worst. I suppose it’s been… well, decades, really. It just gets worse with age. Not that I’m complaining. One expects these things. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Decades of aches and pains is a long time to deal with discomfort. And yes, weather can definitely play a role. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain level typically is?
PATIENT: Hmm… a ten is a bit much, don't you think? I’m not suffering. Perhaps a four? On a good day, a three. But with the dampness, it can easily creep up to a six, maybe even a seven. It's more of a nagging ache, really. Not a sharp, debilitating pain. It just… is. It interferes with my gardening, you see. And one must maintain a beautiful garden.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. So, generally a three to four, with flare-ups to six or seven, especially with the weather, and it impacts your gardening. Have you tried anything for the pain already?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. What do you think I’ve been doing all these years? I’ve tried creams. Rub-ons. My daughter keeps suggesting those little patches, the ones with the menthol, but they smell dreadful. And I took some pills once, years ago, but they made me feel… fuzzy. I don’t like feeling fuzzy. I prefer to be quite lucid, thank you very much. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always just… managed. It’s the modern world that makes such a fuss, I think.
DOCTOR: I see. So creams, some topical rubs, tried some pills in the past that you didn’t like due to the side effects, and generally you’ve been managing on your own. No history of any serious injuries to your knees or back that you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Nothing serious. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with… a full life. A little twist here, a strain there. Nothing that required a doctor's visit, certainly. I'm a very careful woman. I don't go around throwing myself about. Though, I did slip on the patio last spring, but it was just a minor tumble. My daughter insisted on examining me for a fracture, but I assured her I was perfectly fine. Honestly, these young people worry too much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been very resilient over the years. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I had the measles as a child, naturally. And chickenpox. My mother always kept a very clean house, but one can’t avoid everything. I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that passed quickly. Other than that… oh, I had my gallbladder removed in… goodness, must have been twenty years ago now. That was unpleasant. And I'm slightly anemic, the doctor said, but nothing to be concerned about. It just means I get tired a little more easily. Really, that’s about it. I’m a very healthy woman, considering my age. I eat a sensible diet and I get plenty of rest. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Measles, chickenpox as a child, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and some mild anemia. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see… No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thank goodness. I did try a new brand of lotion once that smelled rather artificial, but that just gave me a bit of a rash. Nothing serious. My daughter is always warning me about shellfish, but I've always enjoyed a bit of shrimp cocktail, and I’ve never had a problem. Honestly, I think people exaggerate these things. It's all marketing, you see. Trying to scare you into buying something.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies, a slight rash with a lotion once, and no shellfish allergy. And you're currently not taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: Certainly not! I prefer to rely on my own good constitution, thank you very much. I don’t go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. I find a nice cup of chamomile tea usually does the trick. And a good night’s sleep. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very self-sufficient woman. I haven’t taken a prescription medication in decades. Perhaps not at all. Now, are we getting anywhere with this medical marijuana business, or are we simply documenting my excellent health? My bridge club does start promptly at two.
DOCTOR: You are remarkably self-sufficient, Ellan, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. We are getting somewhere. Based on what you’ve told me, you have chronic aches and pains primarily in your knees and lower back, generally managed with self-care. You're interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential option, and you have no known allergies or current medications. To proceed, I can explain the process for obtaining a medical marijuana certification in our state. It involves a review of your medical records, and a discussion of potential risks and benefits. It’s important to understand that it may not be the right choice for everyone. Would you like me to go over that with you?
PATIENT: Well… yes, I suppose so. Though I must say, I still find the whole thing rather… undignified. But my daughter will be thrilled if I even consider it. Just… please, Doctor, no complicated medical jargon. I want to understand what I’m getting myself into, and I haven't the patience for a lecture. And do tell me how long this will take. My bridge club… you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No complicated jargon, I promise. And I'll be as brief as possible, knowing your time is valuable. Essentially, the process involves confirming you have a qualifying medical condition – chronic pain certainly qualifies – and discussing whether medical marijuana is a safe and appropriate treatment option for you. We’ll talk about different methods of consumption – oils, tinctures, edibles – and potential side effects. If we decide it’s a good fit, I can complete the necessary paperwork for certification. The paperwork itself takes about fifteen minutes, but the discussion is where we ensure it's the right path. It’s less about prescribing something and more about making an informed decision together. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… that might be manageable. But do be concise, Doctor. I’m not interested in a lengthy debate about the virtues of… herbal remedies. I simply want to know if it’s safe, if it will interfere with my bridge game, and if it requires me to… smell of anything unpleasant. Honestly, the thought is quite dreadful. So, yes, let’s get on with it. What are these “methods of consumption” you speak of? And are they… complicated?
DOCTOR: Certainly. No unpleasant smells are required! There are several ways to consume medical marijuana, and none of them are particularly complicated. The most common methods are: Oils and Tinctures: These are liquid extracts placed under the tongue. They offer a discreet and controlled dose. Edibles: These are foods infused with marijuana – cookies, chocolates, etc. The effects take longer to kick in, and it’s important to start with a very low dose. Topicals: These are creams or lotions applied to the skin for localized pain relief. They don't have any psychoactive effects. Vaporizers: These heat marijuana flowers or oils without burning them. For someone new to medical marijuana, I typically recommend starting with oils or topicals, as they are the easiest to control and least likely to cause unwanted side effects. The biggest thing is starting low and going slow. Does that clarify things?
PATIENT: "Edibles?" Honestly, the very idea. I do not need to be eating cookies infused with… that. And I certainly don't want to be explaining that to my bridge partners. Oils and topicals sound… less objectionable. But what are these “unwanted side effects” you speak of? Are we talking dizziness? Confusion? I need to be perfectly lucid for bridge, you understand. I rely on my wits. And I do not want to be seen as… impaired. That would be simply dreadful. Explain. And quickly, please. The time is ticking.
DOCTOR: Certainly. You're right to be concerned about maintaining your mental clarity. The most common side effects are mild and manageable. With oils and tinctures, some people experience mild drowsiness, dry mouth, or a slight change in appetite. Less common side effects can include dizziness or lightheadedness, but these are usually resolved by lying down and drinking water. Topicals have very few side effects, primarily mild skin irritation. More serious side effects are rare, but can include anxiety or paranoia, especially at high doses. That’s why starting with a very low dose is crucial, and it’s important to discuss any concerns with me immediately. We would start with a very small dose – perhaps 2.5 milligrams – and gradually increase it until you find the lowest effective amount. It's a controlled process, and your comfort and safety are my priority. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: 2.5 milligrams… that sounds… manageable. Though I still find the whole thing rather… unsettling. But if it truly is a small amount, and if it won’t interfere with my bridge game, perhaps I’m willing to… consider it. What does this “certification” entail, exactly? And how long will it be valid for? I don't want to be having to repeat this process every few weeks. My time is valuable, Doctor. And I do have a reputation to maintain. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe my bridge partners are expecting me. Let us proceed. But quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The certification process is relatively straightforward. I’ll complete a medical evaluation, document your qualifying condition – chronic pain – and discuss potential risks and benefits. Then, I’ll complete the necessary paperwork and submit it to the state registry. The certification is typically valid for one year. After that, you’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment for a renewal evaluation. The renewal process is generally quicker, as it involves reviewing your progress and making any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. The paperwork itself will take about fifteen minutes. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… very well. Let us get on with it, then. But please, Doctor, no lengthy forms. I haven't the patience for bureaucracy. And I do hope this won't involve any… unpleasant questions. I’ve lived a perfectly respectable life, thank you very much. Now, where do I sign? And will I be required to provide a sample? I simply must know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no unpleasant questions, I assure you. And definitely no samples required. It's a standard medical evaluation, just like any other. This form just confirms your contact information and asks about any changes to your medical history since our conversation. It should only take a few minutes to complete. Please, have a seat, and take your time. Once you've completed the form, we can proceed with the evaluation. And I promise, we'll keep it quick and efficient.
