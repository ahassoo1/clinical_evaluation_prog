DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, it's... a bit embarrassing to talk about, but a friend suggested I look into something to help prevent HIV. She said there's a pill you can take, and I figured I should get checked out and see if it's right for me. I'm Helaina, by the way, in case that wasn't clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, Helaina, it’s good to have your name. Thank you for coming in and discussing this with me. It’s not embarrassing at all to be proactive about your health. You’re right, there is a medication called PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – that can significantly reduce the risk of HIV infection. Before we discuss whether it’s right for you, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Ask away, Doctor. I don’t have any secrets, and I want to make sure we cover everything. Honestly, the more information the better, right? I just… I hope it won’t be a long process. I have a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Trefren. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. It won’t be overly lengthy, I promise. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox and all that, but nothing major as an adult. My blood pressure’s usually a little high when the doctor checks it, but they never said it was too high, just that I should watch my salt intake. And no diabetes, no heart problems. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. I get regular check-ups with my primary care physician, Dr. Kamal, if that helps. She's in Bethlehem.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Dr. Kamal, Bethlehem… I’ll make a note of that. It’s always helpful to have a complete picture. And “a little high” is good information – we'll check it again today, of course. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized. Not even for the tonsils when I was a kid! I broke my arm once, when I was maybe ten, climbing a tree – but that was just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. I'm... not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Always smells like disinfectant and worry. I try to avoid them if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Many people feel that way about hospitals. We’ll certainly try to keep things as simple as possible here. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any other illnesses that are common among your relatives?
PATIENT: Let me see... my mother had high blood pressure, like I said, and she had a bit of arthritis when she got older. My father... he had some heart trouble later in life, but he smoked for a long time, so that's not a huge surprise. My brother is healthy as a horse, thankfully. And my sister… she had breast cancer a few years ago, but she caught it early, and she’s doing well now. She's in Jericho, if you need any further information. I try to keep track of these things, you know? It's good to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to keep track of that, Ms. Trefren. It is helpful. High blood pressure, heart trouble, and breast cancer… I’ll note all of that. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh… social history? What does that even mean? Do you want to know if I like to dance? I haven't danced in years! I’m a bit confused. Is this about, um… my relationships? Because honestly, Doctor, that’s a bit personal, and I’m not really married or anything. I’m single.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Trefren. That was not my intention to be personal. “Social history” is a medical term, and I should have explained it better. I simply mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. It also includes information about your sexual activity, if you are comfortable sharing that, as that can affect your risk of HIV and whether PrEP is a good option for you. It’s all confidential, of course. You don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with. But understanding these factors is important for making the best medical recommendations.
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, that makes much more sense. You should have said so! Yes, well… I don’t smoke, never have. And I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. No recreational drugs, absolutely not. As for… the other part… I haven’t been with anyone regularly for quite some time. A few dates here and there, but nothing serious. And I always… always use protection when I do. It's just… with everything going around, I figured it was better to be safe than sorry, and a friend suggested PrEP. Does that make sense? I'm really just trying to be careful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Trefren. It's very responsible of you to think proactively about your health and take precautions. And it’s good you’ve been using protection. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of! I eat everything. Well, I don’t really eat shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. And no reactions to any medications. I’ve had the usual antibiotics a few times, when I’ve been sick, but nothing major. I'm pretty lucky, honestly. It's good to know these things, though, just in case. Should I be worried about any specific side effects with this PrEP thing? That's the part that worries me the most, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the allergies. And it's wise to be concerned about potential side effects, Ms. Trefren. Most people tolerate PrEP very well, but like all medications, it can have some side effects. The most common ones are mild – things like nausea, fatigue, or headache, which usually go away after a few weeks. More serious side effects are rare, but we’ll discuss them in detail if we decide PrEP is right for you. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that's it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no herbal teas. I try to stay away from all that stuff, honestly. I prefer to just tough it out if I'm feeling sick. It's probably foolish, but that's me. So, no worries there. Are we getting closer to figuring out if this PrEP thing is right for me? I really have another appointment in about an hour, so…
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren, we are getting closer. Thank you for being so forthcoming with your information. It’s very helpful. Before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It’s just a standard check-up – blood pressure, heart rate, listening to your lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. It will help me ensure you’re healthy enough to start PrEP, and to rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. The quicker the better, really. I appreciate you being so efficient, Doctor. I'm a bit nervous about all this, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. And please, don't keep me too long. That appointment is looming!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. I’ll be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142 over 88. We’ll monitor that. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal there. Everything appears to be within normal limits, physically. Given your medical history and the results of this quick exam, you appear to be a good candidate for PrEP. However, we still need to run some blood tests to confirm this. We'll check your kidney function, screen for STIs – sexually transmitted infections – and confirm you don't have HIV already. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Blood tests are fine. I understand it’s necessary. Anything to make sure I’m doing this right. STIs, HIV… yes, let’s check everything. The sooner we know, the better. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be safe. Can you tell me a little bit more about the actual pill? What do I have to do, how often do I take it, and… what if I miss a dose? That's what I'm most worried about. I'm terrible with remembering things, even though I try!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Trefren. It’s good you’re thinking ahead and asking these questions. The pill we typically prescribe is called Truvada or Descovy – both are very effective at preventing HIV. You take one pill daily, at roughly the same time each day, with food. Consistency is key. As for missing a dose… It’s not the end of the world if you miss a dose occasionally. However, it’s important to take it as prescribed as much as possible. If you miss one dose, take it as soon as you remember, but don’t double up to make up for it. If you miss several doses – more than two – you may need to be tested for HIV again before resuming PrEP. That’s because the medication doesn’t reach protective levels in your body immediately, and we want to ensure you’re still protected. We can also discuss strategies to help you remember to take the pill, like setting a reminder on your phone or using a pill organizer. And regular follow-up appointments are crucial – we’ll monitor your kidney function and screen for STIs every three months to ensure everything is going smoothly. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Okay, one pill a day, with food, same time… try not to miss doses, phone reminder… regular check-ups. It sounds… manageable. But the check-ups every three months… that’s a long commitment. And what if I travel? Will I be able to get the pills when I’m away? I travel to visit my sister in Jericho sometimes, and she doesn’t have easy access to a pharmacy. Honestly, Doctor, I just don’t want this to be a huge hassle. I’m trying to be proactive, but I also need it to fit into my life.
DOCTOR: That's a very fair point, Ms. Trefren. You're right to consider the logistics of a long-term commitment. The three-month check-ups are important to ensure your kidney function remains stable and to screen for STIs, but we can discuss options to make it more convenient. Perhaps we can schedule them around your travel schedule, or coordinate with a doctor in Jericho if possible. As for obtaining the pills while traveling… Yes, you should be able to get a refill while you’re visiting your sister. We can write you a prescription for a three-month supply, and you can potentially find a pharmacy in Jericho that carries Truvada or Descovy. If that’s not possible, you can always obtain it before you travel. I can also provide you with a list of pharmacies in the area. We can also discuss the possibility of using a 90-day supply, so you don't have to worry about refills as often. It really comes down to finding what works best for you and your lifestyle. Do you think that sounds reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much more reasonable. A 90-day supply would definitely be better. And knowing I can get a refill in Jericho, or before I go, is a huge relief. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me feel a lot better about all this. I was really worried it would be a huge burden, but you’ve explained everything so clearly. So… what’s next? Do we need to draw blood now? And… how quickly will I get the pills? I’m really hoping to start as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could ease your concerns, Ms. Trefren. That's my job. Yes, the next step is to draw some blood for testing. We'll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a week. Once we have the results and confirm you're a good candidate, I'll write you a prescription for a 90-day supply of Truvada or Descovy. You can then take the prescription to your local pharmacy to get the pills. I’ll also provide you with some educational materials about PrEP, including information about potential side effects and what to do if you experience any. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Is there anything else I can answer for you before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You've been incredibly helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I really appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. I'm still a little nervous, but I feel much more confident about starting PrEP. Honestly, I’m just glad to be taking control of my health. I think I’m ready for the blood draw. Let’s get this over with!
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a great attitude, Ms. Trefren. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be right with you. She’s very experienced, and will make the blood draw as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Trefren.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor Glazewski. Thank you again for everything.
