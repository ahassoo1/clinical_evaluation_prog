DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Andraca, is it? Yes, well. It’s just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. You know, for my daughter-in-law. She’s… going through a phase. A difficult phase. And a card from a doctor… well, it carries weight, doesn’t it? People listen more.
DOCTOR: I see. You'd like me to write a note of support for your daughter-in-law. I'm happy to do that for you, Janeth. While I’m glad to help with a note, as a physician, my primary role is to address medical concerns. Is there anything else going on with your health, or perhaps with your daughter-in-law’s health, that you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, my health is fine. Perfectly fine. I just thought… a little encouragement from someone official. You know, like you. She doesn’t listen to me, of course. Thinks I’m old fashioned. But a doctor… that’s different. Honestly, I don’t even know what’s wrong with her! She just… mopes. And spends too much time on that computer. It’s a phase, I tell you. A very long phase. What kind of things do you usually write on these cards? Something stern, perhaps? A little… nudge?
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like the note to be encouraging, but perhaps with a gentle reminder to seek support if needed. I certainly can do that. It’s important to be supportive, and sometimes a different voice can make a difference. To help me write something appropriate, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, it’s all very… modern. She says she’s “stressed.” Stressed about… well, everything. Her job, her friends, the price of vegetables… I don’t understand it. She used to be a very cheerful girl. Now she just sits in her room, looking at that glowing screen. My son says she’s “overwhelmed.” Whatever that means. She’s lost interest in cooking, she barely speaks to her children… It’s just… not right. I just want her to be happy again. A card from a doctor… maybe it will remind her to snap out of it. Do you write about things like… taking breaks? Or fresh air? It all sounds so silly when I say it out loud.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound silly at all, Janeth. It sounds like your daughter-in-law is going through a difficult time, and you're understandably worried about her. What you’re describing – loss of interest in activities, changes in mood, and increased stress – could be signs of several things. While a card offering support is a lovely gesture, these symptoms could indicate something more that would benefit from professional attention. Has she mentioned anything about feeling sad or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless? Well, not in those exact words. She mostly just says she's “tired.” Very, very tired. And she cries a lot. Mostly when my son isn’t around, I think. She tries to put on a brave face for him. But I see it. I always see it. She used to be so energetic, always planning things. Now she just… exists. She barely eats, she sleeps all day… honestly, it’s like she’s a different person. She does talk about how much pressure there is at work, though. Something about deadlines and… “performance reviews”? I don’t understand any of it. Is that… bad? Should she be seeing someone? I just want a card, Doctor. A nice, firm card.
DOCTOR: Janeth, it sounds like your daughter-in-law is experiencing more than just a “phase.” The fatigue, changes in appetite and sleep, loss of interest in activities, and increased crying, along with the stress she's experiencing at work, are concerning. While I’m happy to write a supportive card, these symptoms are often associated with conditions like depression or anxiety, and it would be important for her to be evaluated by a mental health professional. It’s wonderful that you’re so attentive to her well-being. It sounds like she’s trying to hide her struggles, but you’re noticing a significant change. Would you be open to me suggesting she see a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I hadn’t thought of… that. Depression? Really? She’s always been such a strong girl. Perhaps… perhaps I'm just being an old woman, worrying too much. But she has changed. So much. A therapist… well, that sounds… serious. And she would never agree. She thinks talking about her feelings is… silly. She says I wouldn’t understand. Honestly, it's a lost cause. I just thought a card from a doctor might… jolt her a little. Remind her to pull herself together. Could you just write something about… self-care? And maybe encourage her to go for a walk? Or eat something green? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Janeth, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. It’s not easy to suggest someone seek help, especially when they’re resistant. And you’re right, a gentle encouragement can be a good first step. I'm happy to write a card emphasizing self-care, encouraging her to prioritize her well-being, suggesting she incorporate walks and healthy eating into her routine, and offering a reminder that it's okay to ask for support when needed. However, I do want to reiterate that if these symptoms persist or worsen, seeking a professional evaluation is crucial. I can provide you with some resources for mental health support in the area, if you’d like. Let me draft the card now. Could you tell me your daughter-in-law’s name, so I can address it properly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Her name is Priya. Priya Sharma. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening, I mean. I know you’re busy, and I’m probably just rambling. It’s just… I worry about her. She’s my son’s wife, and I want her to be happy. And healthy. A nice card will be perfect. Just something… encouraging. Not too stern. And please, don't mention anything about… therapy. She’d think I was trying to… fix her. She's very sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. I completely understand. I will focus on a supportive and encouraging message, emphasizing the importance of self-care, and avoid any mention of therapy. Let me finish drafting the card for Priya. It will just take a moment. While I do that, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s all. Just the card. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you listening to an old woman’s worries. It means a lot. I suppose… that’s all. Although… do you think it’s normal for young people to be so… unhappy? It feels like everyone is just… stressed all the time these days. But she's different. It's… unsettling. But the card will be lovely. Just the card. Thank you.
DOCTOR: It’s completely normal to worry about your loved ones, Janeth. And you’re right, there’s a lot of stress in the world today. It's good that you're paying attention to these changes, and it's very loving of you to want to support Priya. Here's the card. I hope it brings her a little comfort. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns, or if Priya’s symptoms worsen. Have a good day, Janeth. And take care of yourself.
