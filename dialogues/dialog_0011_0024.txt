DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Something confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I need it for a trip.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. I can certainly assist you with that, if appropriate. To ensure I can write a suitable letter for you, could you tell me a little more about why you require this confirmation?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, my husband… passed away last year. Unexpectedly. We had a trip planned, already paid for, to visit family in Mongolia. The airline is… being difficult, saying they need a doctor’s note to allow me to travel alone so soon after… everything. They think it might be… a health risk, travelling while grieving, I guess? It’s just… frustrating. I’m perfectly fine to travel, I just need the paperwork.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That sounds incredibly frustrating, and I am very sorry for your loss. It's not uncommon for airlines to have such requirements, though insensitive in this context. We can absolutely address this with a letter. To properly document this and ensure the letter is comprehensive, could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… I'm generally healthy. No major medical conditions. I’m 5’9”, about 130 pounds. I eat pretty well, though I haven’t been… as consistent since last year. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I walk a lot, usually a couple miles a day. I’ve had the usual check-ups, vaccinations, that kind of thing. Medicare covers everything. Is that enough? I can give you more detail if you need it.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Ms. Sayar. Thank you. Just to clarify, when you say "usual check-ups", do you recall the dates of your last physical examination and any routine blood work?
PATIENT: Let me think… my last physical was… March 17th of this year, with Dr. Alvarez. She's retired now, actually. And the blood work was done then, too. Everything was normal, I remember her saying my cholesterol was good, vitamin D was a little low but not concerning, and… she checked my iron, I think? Honestly, I don't recall exactly what she tested, but she said everything looked good and gave me a refill for my vitamin D supplements. I have the paperwork at home, if that would help.
DOCTOR: Yes, having that paperwork would be quite helpful, Ms. Sayar, thank you. In the meantime, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including those over-the-counter or supplements?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just the vitamin D, like I mentioned - 2000 IU daily. And… occasionally ibuprofen for headaches. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had a reason. Just… routine things. Wisdom teeth out when I was young, but that’s it. Everything else has been… just doctor visits and vaccinations. I’m pretty lucky, health-wise. I just want to get this letter so I can finally go see my family. It’s been a long year.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar, and I will do my best to assist you. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Hm. Okay. My mother had high blood pressure, managed it with medication for years. My father… he had some issues with his heart later in life, but it wasn’t diagnosed until he was pretty old, in his eighties. And… my grandmother on my mother’s side had… anxiety, I think? She was very nervous a lot. That’s about it, honestly. No major cancers or anything like that in the immediate family. We weren't a particularly sickly family. Oh! My aunt had carpal tunnel, but that’s not really… significant, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know all of this, Ms. Sayar. Carpal tunnel is good to know as well. Now, finally, could you briefly describe your emotional state since your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. It’s been… hard, obviously. I miss him terribly. I've been sad, a lot. There are good days and bad days. I've been… withdrawn a little, haven't been as social as usual. I've been seeing a grief counselor, though, for about six months now. She says I’m processing things as well as can be expected, given the circumstances. I'm not… depressed, exactly. Just… very sad, and tired. And anxious about travelling alone. It feels like a big step. I just want to make sure I'm doing this for the right reasons, and that I'm strong enough to handle it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Sayar. It takes courage to talk about these things. Based on what you’ve told me, and with the support of your grief counselor, it appears you are coping with your loss in a healthy manner. To complete the assessment for the letter, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment – just to ensure everything is functioning as it should. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I just… want to get this done. The sooner I have the letter, the sooner I can see my family.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take slow, deep breaths in and out. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. That’s within normal limits. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment, checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Overall, your physical examination is unremarkable. Based on your history and this examination, I do not see any medical contraindications to your travel. I can confidently write a letter stating that you are medically fit to fly and that you are capable of handling the emotional stress associated with travel following your recent loss.
PATIENT: That’s… wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. I was so worried you'd say something was wrong. How long will it take to get the letter?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I am glad I could provide reassurance. My nurse, Emily, will prepare the letter for you now. It should take about 10-15 minutes to finalize and print. She will review it with you before you leave to ensure all the information is accurate. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I'll just wait here, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sayar. It was my pleasure. Emily will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to ask her if you need anything at all. Have a peaceful day, and I sincerely hope you enjoy your trip to visit your family.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. .
