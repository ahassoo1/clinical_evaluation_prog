DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Pirl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, pleasure's all yours, I guess. Look, I’m here for this... exam. For the army. They said I gotta get checked out first. Don't really see why, I feel fine. Always have. But rules are rules, right? So here I am.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A pre-employment physical, then. That is perfectly alright. Just routine, as you said. To ensure everything is in order. Perhaps you could tell me a little more about what exactly the army requires of this examination?
PATIENT: Well, the fella at the recruitment office… young lad, barely out of school, really… he just handed me a list. Said it's standard. Blood pressure, height, weight… the usual, I reckon. Something about eyesight too. I can see perfectly fine, by the way. Better than most, I'd wager. Don't really understand why they need to know all this stuff, though. Seems like a waste of time, frankly. You know, good men are needed, not paperwork.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It does seem excessive at times, but it's to ensure the safety and well-being of all recruits, and to determine suitability for various roles within the army. We simply follow protocol. Let's begin with some basic information then. I see here your height is listed as 187 centimeters and your weight as 53 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Fifty-three? Fifty-three kilograms? What kind of a number is that? That’s… ridiculous. Look, I’m a solid frame, alright? Always have been. I’m more like… seventy, seventy-five, easy. Maybe even eighty. Whoever wrote that down clearly doesn't know a thing about proper weight. It’s probably some young lady who thinks a feather weighs ten kilos. I work with machines all day, you need some bulk to do that.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Hartness. It appears there was a significant error in the initial recording. Seventy to eighty kilograms seems much more reasonable, given your stature. Thank you for pointing that out. Accuracy is crucial, of course. Now, aside from this discrepancy, are you currently experiencing any health issues at all?
PATIENT: Health issues? No. Not a one. Look, I’ve always been a strong Swede. Tough as nails, they used to say. I eat well, work hard, and don’t bother with silly things like… complaining. Maybe a bit of stiffness in the back sometimes after a long day, but that's just… getting older, right? Everyone gets that. Nothing to worry about. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and this... this army thing feels like a waste of time, frankly. But I'm here, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: I understand. And it's good to hear you generally feel well. Just to be thorough, could you describe this back stiffness a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… just a bit of ache, you know? After I’ve been bending over the engines all day, tightening bolts, lifting parts. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… a reminder that I’m not twenty years old anymore. It goes away after I rest, usually. I just… stretch it out. Works fine. I haven’t done anything about it, never felt the need. My grandfather worked with steel his whole life and he walked around like a question mark 'til the day he died, and he was still tougher than most men half his age. It's just… part of the job, I guess. Honestly, I don't see what this has got to do with joining the army. Are they expecting me to lift engines in the army?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that so clearly, Mr. Hartness. It's helpful to understand your daily activities and how this stiffness affects you. While the army may not involve lifting engines specifically, physical demands will certainly be present. We simply need to assess your overall health and ensure you're fit for duty. Now, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you may have had?
PATIENT: Past conditions? Hmm... let me think. When I was a lad, maybe eight or nine, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. Simple fracture, healed up fine. Never bothered me since. And... I had the measles, of course. Everyone had the measles back then, it was just something you got. Other than that... nothing. Absolutely nothing. I've always been a healthy Swede, remember? Strong constitution. I never get sick, never been one for doctors, never needed 'em. I’m telling you, this whole thing feels a bit… over the top. Are you sure you need all this information? It's not like I'm applying to be an astronaut. Just a soldier.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Hartness. But it's important to have a complete medical history, even if everything has been uneventful. It helps us establish a baseline and identify any potential risks. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Never had a need for one. Hospitals? Only when my wife gave birth to our two boys. And that wasn't me in the hospital, was it? So, no. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've always prided myself on being able to handle things myself. I fix machines, I fix houses, I fix everything! I don't need doctors cutting me open or sticking me with needles. This is starting to feel ridiculous, honestly. Are you going to ask me about my childhood diet next? I ate what everyone else ate: potatoes, fish, meat. Good, solid Swedish food. That's all.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Hartness, I am not going to inquire about your childhood diet. I am simply trying to gather a complete medical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely none. Never been one for pills. My wife takes something for her… aches and pains, I think. But me? No. I believe in good, honest work and a strong body. That’s all you need. I eat well, sleep well, and don’t bother with all these… fancy drugs. Honestly, this whole process is making me feel like I'm wasting my time. I could be home fixing my neighbor's tractor right now. He's relying on me. Are you sure you need to ask any more questions? I’m telling you, I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. If you're certain you don't take any medications, that's noted. Now, just a few more questions regarding your family history, if you don't mind. Have any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my father, he… he had a bit of a cough later in life. But he smoked like a chimney, so you can imagine. Never bothered him too much, he just… slowed down a bit. My mother, she lived to be eighty-five, healthy as a horse right up until the end. Never had a problem in her life, as far as I know. My brother, he’s fine. Works as an accountant, doesn't do much physical work, so I wouldn't expect him to have any problems. My boys… they're both healthy too. One's a carpenter, the other's a teacher. Good, solid lads. No, I don’t think there’s any… serious illness in the family. Really, I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated here. What are you looking for, exactly? A secret illness? Because I assure you, there isn't one. I’m a healthy Swede. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. We're simply trying to assess any potential genetic predispositions. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not a one. I eat anything. Fish, meat, potatoes, vegetables, everything. Never had a problem. My wife is a bit sensitive to dust, but that's her problem, not mine. I can handle anything. Never had a rash, never had trouble breathing, never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I think this is getting a bit ridiculous. Are you going to ask me about my favorite color next? I'm perfectly healthy, I've told you that a dozen times. I’m a strong Swede. This whole thing feels like a waste of my time and your time. I could be home fixing my neighbor’s fence right now. He’s counting on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your concerns and your frustration. You've repeatedly stated you are in excellent health, and I appreciate you sharing that information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’d be willing. This will simply involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic visual assessment. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Look, I really don't see the point. I told you, I feel fine. Always have. But… alright. If it gets you off my back, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect any surprises. I'm a healthy Swede, remember? Don't poke and prod too much, alright? And hurry it up, if you please. My neighbor is counting on me. He needs me to fix his tractor before sundown. This is a complete waste of time, but… fine. Get on with it. But be gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be as efficient as possible, Mr. Hartness. Please have a seat and remove your shoes and socks. I will start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, Mr. Hartness. 140 over 90. We will need to monitor that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your pulse is also a little fast. And I'm hearing some mild crackling in your lungs. Do you have a cough or any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: A cough? No, not really. Maybe a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing to write home about. I told you, I feel fine! A little crackling in my lungs? What does that even mean? Look, I work with machines all day. I breathe in dust, I breathe in fumes. That’s just… part of the job! It doesn't mean anything. You’re going to tell me I’m dying now, aren’t you? This is ridiculous. I’m a healthy Swede! I work hard, I eat well, I don't smoke, I don't drink. A little crackling in my lungs? It’s probably just dust! Get on with it, if you please. I’m wasting valuable time. My neighbor is counting on me. And what does “elevated blood pressure” even mean? I feel perfectly normal!
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please try to remain calm. "Elevated blood pressure" means your blood pressure is higher than the recommended level. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s something we need to investigate further. The crackling in your lungs could be related to dust inhalation, as you said, but it's also possible it could indicate some early signs of fluid buildup. I would like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Blood work? Now you’re just trying to scare me! Look, I'm not sick. I told you, I feel perfectly fine! You're going to stick me with needles and expose me to radiation? For a little crackling in my lungs and a slightly elevated blood pressure? This is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not doing it. No X-rays, no blood work. I'm a healthy Swede, remember? I don’t need your fancy tests. I’m wasting my time here. I could be fixing my neighbor's fence right now! This whole thing is a complete waste of time and money. I’m perfectly capable of assessing my own health. And frankly, I think you’re overreacting. I'm leaving. This is a complete and utter waste of my time. I’m going home. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I am concerned about your blood pressure and the findings in your lungs. While you may feel fine now, these could be early signs of a more serious condition. Ignoring them could have consequences. I strongly recommend you reconsider the X-ray and blood work. However, I respect your decision. I will document your refusal in your chart. Here is a referral to a general practitioner. Please schedule an appointment with them soon, even if you continue to feel well. They can provide further assessment and guidance. I wish you good health, Mr. Hartness.
