DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. I think it’s about… starting a family. Or, planning to, maybe. My… someone I care about and I… we want to know if we should be doing things… differently, before we try. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, honestly. I’m not so young anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verrall. It’s very responsible of you to think about this proactively. And it's not embarrassing at all – many couples are in a similar situation. We'll do our best to give you the information you need. Just to clarify, you're asking about preconception counseling – trying to optimize your health before attempting to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. “Preconception.” Yes. That's the word. I keep hearing things… about age and… things getting harder. And I want to make sure… everything is okay. If there is anything I should be doing… or worried about. I don’t really know where to start, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s start with some basic information. You're right to be thinking about age. Male fertility can decline with age, though it's often more gradual than the changes women experience. It's good you're coming in now. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s… a lot of years to remember. I’ve broken a few bones, I think. When I was younger, working. And… I had the usual childhood things. Measles, mumps… I haven’t been seriously ill in a long time, though. Not like needing to be in the hospital or anything. I don’t really… go to the doctor much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No major illnesses requiring hospitalization recently – good. Any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… there was… a mole removed, maybe ten years ago? On my back. A small one. Nothing big. And… oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. I barely remember it. That's all I can think of, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, mole removal and appendectomy. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I take… a multivitamin sometimes. Not every day, though. Just when I remember. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. It’s… an anti-inflammatory, I think. Ibuprofen? Is that what it’s called? The kind you get at the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife… my ex-wife, used to be allergic to peanuts, but that’s not me. No, I don't think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your immediate family – parents, siblings – had any problems with fertility?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… we didn’t really talk about those things much. My father had… brothers, I think. And they had children. I don’t remember anyone having trouble. But I wasn’t very close to them, to be honest. And my mother… she just never spoke about it. I don’t really know. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s common for those conversations not to happen. We can proceed without that information, though if you happen to think of anything later, please let me know. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. I used to be around it, when I was younger, working with… other men. But I never liked it. Bad for you, you know. And… I don't like the smell.
DOCTOR: Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every night, though. Maybe a couple of times a week? Nothing heavy. Just one or two glasses. I don't drink to excess, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you engage in regular physical activity?
PATIENT: I try to. I walk… when the weather is good. And I do some gardening. It keeps me busy. It’s not… running marathons or anything. But I’m not completely inactive, if that makes sense. My knees get sore sometimes, so I have to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good general picture. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll just involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, and a quick examination of your… well, the relevant areas. It won't be anything invasive. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. I suppose. As long as it's not… too unpleasant. I don’t like doctors poking around too much, but I understand it’s probably necessary. Just be gentle, please. My body isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to quickly palpate your abdomen. Just feeling for anything unusual. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal there as well. Finally, I’d like to do a quick examination of your… genital area. Just to check for any abnormalities. This is a standard part of a preconception evaluation. Everything appears normal there as well. No obvious concerns. Alright, Mr. Verrall. The physical exam didn't reveal anything concerning. However, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a semen analysis to assess sperm count, motility, and morphology. And a basic blood panel to check your overall health and hormone levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary. A semen analysis… that sounds a little… embarrassing, to be honest. But if it will help… then yes. And the blood work is fine too. Just let me know what I need to do. Where do I go for all of this?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about the semen analysis, Mr. Verrall. It's a common concern. It’s a standard test and completely confidential. The lab is right down the hall – room 203. They’ll give you instructions on how to collect the sample. You’ll need to provide a sample at the lab, and it's best to abstain from sexual activity for two to five days beforehand for the most accurate results. The lab technician will explain everything in detail. As for the blood work, you’ll need to go to Quest Diagnostics – there’s a location on Main Street, just a few blocks from here. I’ll print out a lab requisition form for you with all the necessary tests marked. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. Here are the forms. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we can discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… that’s a long time. And two to five days… This is more complicated than I thought. Quest Diagnostics… I think I’ve heard of that place. Yes, I think I understand. Just the sample and the blood work, then bring the results back to you. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. Just… try to remember all of this. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. Don't worry too much about remembering everything at once. The lab staff will guide you through the process. If you do have any questions later, please don't hesitate to call my office. We're here to help. Here's my card with the office number. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the results. In the meantime, try to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle – eating well, staying active, and avoiding stress. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience. I suppose I should be going then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT:
