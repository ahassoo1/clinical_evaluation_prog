DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Bahta, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here… well, a friend suggested I inquire about assistance for my mother. She is… not doing well, and I believe we may benefit from home health, or perhaps hospice care. I am unsure of the specifics, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Home health or hospice… right. And how old is your mother, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: She is eighty-seven years of age, Doctor. Eighty-seven on the fifteenth of next month, to be precise. She has… a number of ailments, if I may use that word. Mostly weakness, and… difficulty with everything, really. She requires assistance with all daily tasks now.
DOCTOR: Eighty-seven. A number of ailments… yes, that's helpful. And what specifically are these ailments?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… she had a fall six months ago and broke her hip. It healed, but she never regained her strength. Before that, she was diagnosed with… something affecting her memory, Doctor. The doctors called it… oh dear, I forget the name. Something to do with the brain. And she has… heart trouble. She tires very easily, gets short of breath. Is that… specific enough? I apologize for not having a detailed list. My focus has been on simply ensuring she is comfortable.
DOCTOR: “Something affecting her memory” and “heart trouble”… honestly, Mr. Bahta, this is… vague. But alright. Was she ever formally diagnosed with the memory issue?
PATIENT: Yes, she was. At the hospital, about two years ago. They said… Alzheimer’s disease. That was the diagnosis, yes. I recall the doctor explaining it at length, but… I’m not a medical man, Doctor. I simply took her to the appointments. And, if I may ask, is this information pertinent to determining eligibility for the care I inquired about? I just wish to ensure I’m providing you with what is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alzheimer’s… alright. That is slightly more useful. And has she been formally evaluated recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Let me think… no, not recently. The last evaluation was… approximately one year ago, I believe. It was done by Dr. Moreau, at the Saint-Michel hospital. He said the condition was… progressing, naturally. He adjusted her medication at that time, and suggested we consider… additional support. That is why I am here, Doctor. I hope that answers your question. Is there a form I might fill out to expedite the process? I am happy to provide any further information you require.
DOCTOR: I see no record of an evaluation by a Dr. Moreau. Perhaps it was entered under a different name?
PATIENT: That is… odd. I am certain it was Dr. Moreau. He was a specialist in geriatric care, at Saint-Michel. Perhaps… perhaps it was entered under my name? Or my mother’s maiden name, Dubois? She often used that when making appointments. I apologize for this confusion, Doctor. I am not accustomed to navigating medical records. I simply wish to ensure my mother receives the best possible care. Perhaps a phone call to the hospital might clarify this discrepancy?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Bahta, I appreciate your concern, but this is becoming… inefficient. We need accurate information to proceed. Do you have any of her medical records with you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I left them at home. I thought… I thought a verbal account would suffice for an initial assessment. I did not anticipate this level of… detail being required. I apologize again. I can certainly retrieve them, if you wish. It will require… a few hours, however. I live some distance away. Is there anything else I can provide at this moment? Perhaps her insurance card? I have that in my wallet.
DOCTOR: Insurance is fine. Look, Mr. Bahta, to even consider home health or hospice, I need a clearer picture of her medical state. We need to know what medications she's on, any recent hospitalizations, lab results… and frankly, a recent physical assessment. Otherwise, it's just guesswork. Let's start with the medications. Can you at least list those?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. The medications… let me see. She takes… a small white pill for her blood pressure, I believe. And a larger blue one for her… heart. And a yellow capsule for… sleep. Oh, and sometimes a pain reliever, a small pink tablet, when her hip aches. I apologize, Doctor, I am not familiar with the precise names. My wife always handled that aspect of her care. She passed away last year. It has… been difficult. I can obtain a complete list from her pharmacy, if you wish. It will take some time, but I am happy to do so.
DOCTOR: "Small white pill," "larger blue one," "yellow capsule..." Honestly. Look, Mr. Bahta, this is… incredibly unhelpful. Without knowing the actual medications, we can’t assess for interactions or even determine her baseline health. I understand your loss, truly, but this is her medical care we’re discussing. I can’t proceed like this. I suggest you contact her pharmacy, obtain a complete medication list, and schedule a follow-up appointment. Perhaps bringing the actual medication bottles would be beneficial. Until then, there’s nothing further I can do.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, you are absolutely correct. I apologize profusely for my lack of… precision. It was foolish of me to think I could provide adequate information without proper documentation. I will contact her pharmacy immediately and obtain a complete list, as you suggested. And I will certainly bring the bottles to the follow-up appointment. I understand your position entirely. I simply… I am anxious to ensure my mother receives the best possible care, and I allowed my anxiety to cloud my judgment. Thank you for your patience, Doctor. I will schedule an appointment as soon as possible. .
