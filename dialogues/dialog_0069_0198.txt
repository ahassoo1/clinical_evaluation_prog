DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking a lot about… finding some peace, I guess. I heard good things about mindfulness, and meditation, and thought maybe this would be a good place to ask about it. I work on the railway, repairing signals and switches – it can be… stressful, and I just feel like I need to learn some ways to calm things down a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sugino. That sounds like a demanding job, and it's very proactive of you to think about stress management. It's excellent that you're considering mindfulness and meditation. Before we dive into that, though, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Sometimes stress manifests physically, and it's helpful to rule out any other contributing factors. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That makes perfect sense. I don’t mind at all. I'm generally healthy, I think. I have Medicare, so I get my check-ups regularly. But, honestly, I mostly just focus on getting the work done and haven’t really paid much attention to… well, anything else, lately. I suppose that’s not very good, is it?
DOCTOR: It's very common, Ms. Sugino, especially with a busy schedule. Many people prioritize work and other responsibilities, and health sometimes takes a backseat. No need to feel bad about it. Since you mentioned regular check-ups with Medicare, that’s great! Do you happen to know when your last physical exam was, and if anything specific was discussed or addressed then?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… February, I believe. February 14th, actually. Dr. Petrova did it. She said my blood pressure was a little high, but nothing terrible. She suggested I watch my salt intake, which I’ve been trying to do, but… working on the railway, there’s a lot of pre-packaged food available. It’s not always easy to find healthy options. She didn’t mention anything else, as far as I recall. Just the blood pressure and the salt.
DOCTOR: Okay, February 14th with Dr. Petrova, noted. Slightly elevated blood pressure, recommendation to watch salt intake. That's helpful to know. And you're right, access to healthy food can be a real challenge with your work schedule. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you've been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms. Well, I’ve been sleeping… not as well as I used to. I don’t necessarily have trouble falling asleep, but I wake up a lot during the night. And I’ve been feeling… a bit more tired than usual, even with enough sleep – or what should be enough sleep. Also, my shoulders are always tense. I think that's from the work, constantly reaching and working with tools. Not a pain, exactly, just… tight. And maybe a little bit… irritable. My colleagues have commented on it, actually. They say I'm a bit short-tempered. I don't mean to be, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep, fatigue, shoulder tension, and increased irritability. That paints a clearer picture, Ms. Sugino. It sounds like the stress from work is definitely having a noticeable impact. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other changes, like headaches, digestive issues, changes in appetite, or any feelings of sadness or hopelessness?
PATIENT: No headaches, thankfully. And my appetite is… normal, I suppose. I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes I skip lunch if I’m really busy, but nothing regular. Digestive issues… occasionally a bit of heartburn, but I think that’s the pre-packaged food again. No feelings of sadness or hopelessness, no. I wouldn't say I'm unhappy, just… overwhelmed, sometimes. And tired. Very tired. I definitely wouldn't describe it as sadness. Just… a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sugino. Overwhelmed and tired. That's very helpful. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been lucky, so far. My mother had some arthritis when she was older, but that was about it. My father was healthy as a horse right up until the end. I think good genes help. I haven't had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything serious, either. Just the usual colds and flu over the years. Nothing that required more than a visit to the family doctor. I've always been a pretty healthy person, honestly. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Sugino. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, generally good health until recently. And you mentioned your mother had arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medicine. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My colleagues tease me about it because they’re always having to carry EpiPens or antihistamines. I just… don’t have any sensitivities. I consider myself quite lucky, all things considered. Though, maybe that's why I'm feeling so run down now – I haven't had to deal with anything serious before, so I don't know how to cope!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, no known allergies. And you’re right, sometimes it’s the lack of prior experience that makes things feel more challenging. Okay, one last quick question about your medical history. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I've tried ibuprofen for headaches occasionally, but I try to rest instead. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. I just… don't take anything regularly. I really prefer to let my body do its own thing, if possible. I suppose that hasn't been working very well lately, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. Hopefully, this mindfulness thing will help.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. It’s consistent with what Dr. Petrova noted. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Your ears also appear normal. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal anything concerning. Your vital signs are slightly elevated, which could be due to stress, but everything else appears normal.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, to hear. Even if it's just a little bit reassuring. So, what does that mean, Doctor? What do we do now? Is this mindfulness thing even going to help, or am I just wasting my time? I feel like I'm always tired and on edge, and I really don't know where to start.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, it’s completely understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and you're definitely not wasting your time. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of stress and possible mild anxiety. While we can’t definitively diagnose anything without further investigation if needed, your symptoms are very consistent with that. Mindfulness and meditation are excellent starting points. They’ve been shown to be very effective in managing stress, reducing anxiety, and improving sleep quality. However, since your blood pressure is slightly elevated and you're experiencing fatigue, I'd like to rule out any underlying medical causes. I’m going to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. If it helps to rule things out, then definitely. Blood work is no problem at all. I’m just glad you’re taking it seriously. It's easy to dismiss things when you’re just… tired all the time. I appreciate you doing that. And then, after the blood work… what about the mindfulness? Do you have any recommendations? Or resources? I don't even know where to begin.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It’s my job to take your concerns seriously and help you find a solution. As for mindfulness, there are many resources available. I often recommend the Headspace or Calm apps – they offer guided meditations for beginners, and they’re very user-friendly. There are also many free resources online, such as guided meditations on YouTube or podcasts. I also have some pamphlets here with information on local mindfulness classes and workshops. For now, I suggest starting with just 5-10 minutes of meditation each day. Find a quiet space where you won't be disturbed, and focus on your breath. Don't worry if your mind wanders – that's perfectly normal. Just gently redirect your attention back to your breath. I will also write you a referral to a therapist specializing in stress management techniques, in case you feel like you would benefit from professional support. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of information. But good information. Thank you. Apps, YouTube, workshops… I suppose I can try the apps. That seems the least intimidating. And yes, a referral to a therapist would be good. Just to have it, in case. I don't think I need it right now, but it's good to know I have that option. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It makes me feel a little less… lost, honestly. What about the blood work? How do I get that done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help you feel a little less lost. As for the blood work, I’ll send an order electronically to the lab at [Name of local lab]. You can go any time during their business hours – you don’t need an appointment. Here’s a requisition form – you’ll need to take this with you. The lab will send the results directly to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as I’ve had a chance to review them. That should be within about a week. In the meantime, try to prioritize self-care as much as possible. Get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and find ways to relax and de-stress. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And patient. I really appreciate it. I’ll try the apps, and I’ll get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thank you again for everything. I hope to hear good news next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad I could help. I’m optimistic that we can get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I’ll be in touch next week with the results of your blood work. Have a good day, Ms. Sugino, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
