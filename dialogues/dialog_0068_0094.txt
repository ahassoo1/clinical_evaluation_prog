DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Right. The... education visit. My husband, he said I should come. Something about… learning. I don’t really remember what for, exactly. It’s… about my work, I think? I work with metal. Lots of noise.
DOCTOR: Metal work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Sheet metal. Big sheets. Cutting and… bending. It’s… hard work. Very important work, actually. Not everyone can do it. It’s not like office work, you know? Much more… real.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Important work. And the noise… how long have you been doing this work, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Ugh, a long time. Maybe… ten years? Or more? It all kinda blends together. It's always noisy. Always. I don’t… I don’t know if that’s important. Is it? Should I be counting years? My husband never said anything about counting.
DOCTOR: It can be important. Prolonged exposure to noise… it can sometimes affect your hearing. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing recently?
PATIENT: Hearing? Hmm… Well, sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves. But everyone mumbles these days, don't they? My husband mumbles a lot. So it's hard to tell if I'm not hearing, or if they’re just not speaking clearly.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any ringing in your ears, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Ringing? Like… bells? No. Not bells. Sometimes… a buzzing. Very quiet. Like… a fly maybe? But not always. It comes and goes. It’s probably just… the house. Old houses make noises.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this buzzing… does it seem to be worse after a long day at work?
PATIENT: Maybe? I'm usually just so tired after work I don’t really notice much. I just want to sit down. And my husband usually has dinner ready, so I’m focused on that. He makes a good… stew. It helps with the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay. We should probably do a quick hearing test just to get a baseline, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s a simple test, won’t take long. We have a room right down the hall. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? Ugh. More tests. Fine, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have things to do, you know. Dinner to eat. My husband… he doesn't like waiting. Is it… painful? I don’t like painful things.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's completely painless. You'll just wear headphones and listen for sounds. A technician will be in the room with you to guide you. I'll be back to discuss the results afterward. Let’s go ahead and get you set up. Follow me.
PATIENT: Headphones… fine. As long as it's quiet. I really don't need more noise today. Okay, lead the way. But don’t go too fast, alright? My feet aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. Take your time. We want to make sure you're comfortable. The technician, Sarah, is very good. She’ll explain everything. We'll get this done quickly, then we can talk about… preventative measures. Yes, preventative measures. For the noise.
PATIENT: Preventative… what now? Look, I came for education. Not… more things. Is this going to involve changing my job? Because I like my job. It’s real work. My husband says I’m good at it.
DOCTOR: No, no, not changing your job, Ms. Fontanazza. Just… learning how to protect your hearing while you do it. Things like… ear protection. Earplugs, or earmuffs. It’s a simple precaution. We just want to make sure you can continue doing what you enjoy, safely. Let's get through this hearing test first, and then we’ll discuss the options. Okay?
PATIENT: Earplugs? Those are… uncomfortable. I tried them once. Couldn’t hear anything. How am I supposed to work if I can’t hear the machines? And earmuffs? Those look silly. My husband would laugh. Honestly, this is probably a waste of time. I’ve been doing this job for years. I’m fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll see what the test shows. Sometimes, even if you think you’re fine, there can be subtle changes. Let’s just get the test done, and then you can decide if you want to consider any options. Sarah is just ahead, in room 3. I'll be back shortly to discuss the results with you.
PATIENT: Fine. Room 3, you say? Earplugs… Honestly. My husband is going to think this is ridiculous. He always says I worry too much.
