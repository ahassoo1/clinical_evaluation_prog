DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully tired during the day, even though I’m using the machine they gave me for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be helping as much as it should, and it’s getting… well, it’s getting to be a bother, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tiredness despite using the CPAP machine… that’s definitely something we need to look into. And it’s good you’re telling me it’s a bother; comfort and compliance are really important. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not just a little sleepy, you know? It’s like… a weight. Hard to get going in the morning, even with a cup of coffee. And it lasts all day. I find myself dozing off in my chair while I read, which I used to never do. Even driving… I’ve had to pull over once or twice to shake myself awake. It’s worrying, frankly. I used to be so sharp, you know? Now I feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a significant fatigue, impacting your daily activities…difficulty getting started in the morning, lasting all day, dozing off even while reading and concerningly, while driving. And you’re noticing a change in your mental clarity – feeling “foggy,” as you put it. That’s important information. To get a better picture, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… The machine itself… I’ve been using it consistently for about six months now, maybe a little longer. But this tiredness… it started creeping in about three months ago, I’d say. At first, I thought it was just getting used to the mask, you know? But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s actually… gotten worse, if I’m being honest. It’s been a slow slide, really. Not sudden, but noticeable. I just hoped it would resolve itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so six months on the CPAP, fatigue developing around three months ago, and progressively worsening. It’s good you’ve been consistent with the machine, and it’s also helpful that you’ve noticed the gradual change. Let’s talk a little about the machine itself. Are you experiencing any problems with it?
PATIENT: No, not really problems… it works. It’s just… uncomfortable sometimes. The mask leaks a bit, I think. I wake up with a dry mouth a lot. And the noise… it’s not loud, but it’s there. My ex-wife used to complain about it, so I sleep in a separate room now, anyway. But I make sure the pressure is set correctly, the technician showed me how. I clean it regularly, too. It’s more that it’s a nuisance than a problem, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Mask leaks, dry mouth, and noise – those are common complaints and can definitely contribute to feeling less rested. It sounds like you’re being very diligent about maintaining it, which is good. Now, shifting gears a bit, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a bit more irritable than usual, I suppose. Not angry, exactly, but… short-tempered. My daughter noticed it, actually. She said I was “grumpy.” And I’ve been having… well, not bad headaches, just… dull ones. Mostly in the mornings. And… oh, this might be nothing… but I’ve been feeling a little more forgetful lately. Small things, you know? Where I put my keys, what I was going to say… Nothing major. But enough to notice. I used to have a very good memory. Taught history for forty years, you see.
DOCTOR: Irritability, morning headaches, and increased forgetfulness… Okay, that’s a lot of useful information. The headaches and forgetfulness are particularly noteworthy, especially with your history as a history teacher. Now, let's go through some general health questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well-controlled with medication for years. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was a one-time thing. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to walk a lot, but I’ve been less motivated lately, with being so tired. Oh, and I have some mild arthritis in my knees, but it doesn’t bother me too much. Mostly just stiff in the mornings. And, of course, the sleep apnea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hypertension well-controlled, history of gallbladder removal, arthritis, and, of course, the sleep apnea. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Yes. Let me see… I take lisinopril for the blood pressure – ten milligrams a day. And I take a multivitamin, just a standard one. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But not very often. That’s it, I think. Oh! And I take a little bit of melatonin at night, sometimes, to try and help me sleep. But it doesn’t seem to make much difference, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 10mg daily, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and melatonin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be a bit sensitive to shellfish when I was a child, but I’ve outgrown that. Nothing bothers me now. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. My ex-wife, on the other hand… she was allergic to everything! But me, no. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart problems. He died of a heart attack when he was in his seventies. My mother lived to be ninety-two, she was very healthy. She did have some arthritis, like me. And my brother… he has diabetes. Other than that… not much, really. Nothing major that I’m aware of. My grandparents all lived to a good age, as far as I know. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered. Though, I suppose, with my father… that’s a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, mother with arthritis, brother with diabetes. We'll keep that in mind. Now, one last set of questions, if you don't mind. Could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m divorced, as I mentioned earlier. Been divorced for about fifteen years now. I live alone in a small house. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that lately. Didn’t seem to be helping my sleep, if I’m honest. I don’t do a lot of traveling anymore. Used to travel quite a bit when I was younger, with my work. Now, mostly I just read and watch television. I have a daughter, she lives in another state. We talk on the phone a lot. And… well, that’s about it. Pretty quiet life these days. It’s… comfortable, I suppose. Just a bit lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, divorced, lives alone, no smoking, limited alcohol, daughter out of state. Alright, Mr. Paske, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then we can discuss some potential causes for your fatigue and come up with a plan. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? It's been a while.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Okay, heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 138/82. Ears appear normal. Nose and throat are normal. No obvious signs of infection. Thyroid is normal to palpation, no nodules or enlargement. Everything seems normal so far. But given your fatigue, headaches, forgetfulness and the fact that you’re still experiencing symptoms despite CPAP use, I’d like to order some blood work. I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and complete blood count, and electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to do them. I trust your judgment. I'm just glad we're getting somewhere. I've been feeling so… lost, lately. It's good to have a plan. So, yes, blood work sounds perfect. Will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll need a fasting blood sample for the most accurate results. Please don’t eat or drink anything – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. While we wait for the results, it’s also important to review your CPAP settings. Sometimes, the pressure isn’t quite right, or there might be a leak we haven’t identified yet. I’m going to give you a referral to a sleep technician for a CPAP mask fitting and pressure check. They can ensure you're getting optimal therapy. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, that would be wonderful. I’m happy to go to a technician. Maybe they can find something I’ve missed. I try to be careful, but it’s possible I’m not setting it up correctly. Scheduling that would be a great help. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing we're looking into all of this. It’s a relief.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've scheduled you for a CPAP mask fitting and pressure check with the technician next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Here's the requisition form for the blood work. You can go to the lab anytime that’s convenient for you. Once we get the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache – please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Tuesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and for being so thorough. I feel much more hopeful now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're in this together. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
