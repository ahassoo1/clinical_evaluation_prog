DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though I suspect you already know that from the chart. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective gear. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, as I’ve been having some difficulties with them.
DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Knabenshue. I do see that here. And it’s a pleasure to meet you as well. So, these difficulties… can you tell me more about what’s been happening?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. It isn’t a simple discomfort, you see. When I wear a mask for any extended period, I begin to feel… disconnected. Almost like I’m losing my sense of self, if that makes any sense. It’s a very unsettling feeling, and it affects my concentration, my ability to do my job effectively. I work with people, and I need to be fully present and aware of my surroundings. It’s also… well, it feels disrespectful to my ancestors, if I’m being honest. It’s hard to explain the spiritual aspect of it. But it's a genuine concern, not just a preference.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s… a complex set of symptoms and concerns, Mr. Knabenshue. Thank you for being so open with me. When did you first start noticing this disconnection while wearing a mask?
PATIENT: It began shortly after the mandates were put in place, Doctor. Around… March of 2020, I believe. Initially, I thought it was just stress, the anxiety of everything happening. But it hasn't subsided, even as things have calmed down. It actually worsened, if I’m being truthful. I tried different types of masks – cloth, surgical, N95 – hoping a different fit would help, but it made no difference. It's the sensation of having my face covered, I believe, that is the core of the problem. I can recall quite clearly the date of the first mask requirement, March 20th, 2020. It was a Friday, if I’m not mistaken.
DOCTOR: Okay, March 20th, 2020. And you’ve tried various mask types with no relief. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside this feeling of disconnection?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Along with the disconnection, I've noticed a significant increase in headaches. They typically start at the base of my skull and radiate outwards. And my breathing becomes… constricted. Not to the point of panic, but uncomfortable. It's as if the mask is… limiting my life force, for lack of a better term. I also get very fatigued after wearing a mask for a few hours. It's not a physical exhaustion, necessarily, but a mental draining. I can recall the specifics of the headaches quite vividly – they are usually a throbbing pain, worse on the left side of my head. They typically begin within thirty minutes of putting on a mask.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches—throbbing, typically on the left side, starting within 30 minutes of wearing a mask—constricted breathing, and mental fatigue. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness associated with mask wearing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, actually. It comes and goes, but I have experienced instances of dizziness, particularly when I stand up quickly after wearing a mask for an extended period. It’s not severe enough to cause me to fall, but enough to feel unsteady. And sometimes, a slight lightheadedness accompanies the dizziness. I recall one specific instance – it was on July 14th, 2023. I was assisting a client when I stood up, and everything seemed to swim for a moment. I had to steady myself against the wall. It frightened me, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and lightheadedness, especially upon standing. And you mentioned a specific date – July 14th, 2023. Mr. Knabenshue, do you have a history of any anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have always been a relatively stable individual, emotionally and mentally. I have faced hardships, certainly, as we all do, but I have always been able to cope with them effectively. I've never been diagnosed with any mental health condition, nor have I ever sought treatment for one. My family has a history of… resilience, I suppose, rather than mental illness. I can recall quite clearly my mother telling me about her grandmother surviving the boarding school era, and the strength that took. It’s a family trait, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any physical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing significant. I have the usual aches and pains that come with age, but nothing that would prevent me from performing my duties. My blood pressure is usually quite good, and my cholesterol is within normal limits. I haven’t been to the doctor in a few years, truthfully – I generally avoid it unless absolutely necessary. I do have slightly high blood sugar, my last checkup showed 130, but it’s considered pre-diabetic and managed through diet and exercise. But again, nothing that would be directly related to these issues with the masks, in my estimation. I can recall the results of that blood test perfectly, as it was a concern for my sister.
DOCTOR: Okay, pre-diabetes, managed with diet and exercise. I see. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please proceed at your convenience. I am quite comfortable with a physical checkup. I believe in the importance of due diligence. Just let me know if there is anything I need to do. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Ears are clear. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of inflammation. Now, I’d like you to stand up slowly. Any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Standing up did not induce any dizziness or lightheadedness, thankfully. I was expecting it, truthfully, given my previous experiences. It seems to be specifically related to the mask wearing, not simply standing up. It is a relief to know that standing alone does not trigger the sensation. I can recall feeling a slight… disorientation for a moment, but it quickly subsided. It was a very mild sensation, not nearly as pronounced as when I'm wearing a mask.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I suspect we're dealing with a combination of factors. The pre-diabetes could be contributing to some of the lightheadedness, as could the stress of the situation. However, your description of the disconnection and the spiritual aspect of it is quite compelling. And the fact that it’s directly related to mask wearing, and not standing alone, is significant. I’m hesitant to dismiss the possibility of a physiological response to the mask itself, but I also want to rule out other potential causes. I’m going to order a blood test to check your blood sugar levels, thyroid function, and vitamin D levels. I also want to rule out any underlying anemia. Would you be open to a referral to a therapist or counselor to discuss the spiritual aspect of this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe that would be prudent. Ordering the blood tests to rule out other possibilities seems a very sensible course of action. I am happy to comply with that request. And, yes, a referral to a therapist or counselor to discuss the spiritual aspect of this would be… beneficial, I believe. It is difficult to articulate these feelings to someone outside of my culture, but perhaps a professional could offer some guidance. I am open to that suggestion entirely. I can recall a discussion with my sister about the importance of mental wellbeing, and she encouraged me to seek professional help if I ever felt overwhelmed. This seems like a good opportunity to do so.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m submitting the lab orders now. They should be sent to the lab electronically, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I’m also going to put in a referral for a therapist specializing in culturally sensitive care. I'll give you the contact information for a few options. For now, I recommend avoiding masks as much as possible until we have the lab results. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: That is most gracious of you, Doctor. Thank you for taking my concerns seriously and for ordering the tests and the referral. Receiving the contact information for the therapists will be very helpful. Avoiding masks until we have the results seems a logical approach. No, Doctor, I believe that is all for today. I appreciate your time and your thorough examination. I will contact the lab to schedule the blood tests and review the information regarding the therapists. I am hopeful we can find some resolution to this issue.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Knabenshue. I'll have the lab orders and referral information sent to you electronically. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And feel free to reach out once you’ve had a chance to schedule your appointments. Take care, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I will certainly contact you once I've scheduled the appointments. Have a pleasant day. .
