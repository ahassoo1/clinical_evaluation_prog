DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggart. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve got this yellowing… jaundice, I think the emergency room called it… after I ate fava beans. It happened twice now, and both times it was after fava beans.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I know it sounds odd. I usually love them, but the last two times I had them… within a day or so, I started feeling weak and my skin and eyes got really yellow. The emergency room did some tests and said something about my blood… anemia, I think? And that it was connected to the beans. But they sent me here for a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And how long ago were these incidents with the fava beans?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The first time was about six weeks ago, I’d say. And then just last week. So, about a month and a half between them. Both times I ate a fairly large portion… I was making a stew. I didn't think anything of it at the time, I've always eaten fava beans.
DOCTOR: And aside from the fatigue and the jaundice, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been a bit short of breath sometimes, just walking up the stairs. And I think… maybe a little dizziness. Nothing too bad, but enough that I noticed it. It’s hard to say if it’s connected, but it started around the same time as the tiredness, really. Is that… is that normal with this bean thing? I really don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to get to the bottom of it. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, Ms. Haggart?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the usual childhood things, like chickenpox. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I haven't needed to see a doctor much over the years. No allergies that I know of, either. Oh! Except… when I was a little girl, my mother always said I was sensitive to certain medicines, but I don’t remember exactly what they were. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my parents are both gone now. And I don't have any siblings. My mother was Romanian, like me, and my father was… Polish, I think. They weren't from around here. As far as I know, nobody in my family ever had anything seriously wrong with their health. They both lived to be quite old, actually. Now that you ask… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he was always a bit pale, but nobody ever made much of it. He lived in the countryside, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just the usual… trying to eat healthy. Maybe a multivitamin now and then, but not regularly. And definitely nothing since… well, since the beans! I’ve been avoiding them like the plague. It’s a bit of a shame, actually. I used to make a lovely stew with them.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. We'll also check your sclera – the whites of your eyes – to assess the jaundice. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's causing all this, and get back to feeling normal again. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat and lie back. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take slow, deep breaths. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Yes, there is definite scleral icterus present. Mild, but visible. Skin tone is also slightly yellowish. There’s some slight hepatosplenomegaly – enlargement of the liver and spleen – but it’s not significant. Now, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme assay. That will help us determine if you have a G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia triggered by certain foods, like fava beans. It will also give us a baseline of your liver function.
PATIENT: That sounds… complicated. But if it will help figure things out, then that’s good. What exactly is a G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that before. And how long will it take to get the results? Will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: A G6PD deficiency, or Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency, is a genetic condition. It means your red blood cells don't have enough of a certain enzyme to function properly. This makes them vulnerable to damage from certain substances, like… fava beans, certain medications, and even infections. It can cause a sudden, severe anemia, which explains the fatigue, jaundice, and shortness of breath you’ve been experiencing. It’s relatively uncommon, but more prevalent in people of Mediterranean, African, and Asian descent. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. In the meantime, it’s crucial to avoid fava beans completely. Also, I will provide you with a list of medications to avoid. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It sounds… a bit scary, to be honest. A genetic condition… I’m Romanian, as you know, so maybe that explains it? And avoiding fava beans completely… that’s going to be difficult. I really liked making that stew. Could I get a copy of that list of medications, just to be safe? And… is there anything else I should be doing right now? Like, should I be resting more? Or eating a special diet?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a possibility given your ancestry. As for the medications, my nurse will provide you with a printed list before you leave. As for precautions, rest is advisable, but it’s not a curative measure. A special diet isn’t necessary at this point, but ensure adequate hydration. Avoid any strenuous activity. More importantly, it’s vital that you inform any healthcare provider you see in the future about this potential G6PD deficiency. Certain medications can trigger a crisis. We’ll discuss further management strategies once the lab results are back. Do you have any other questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it's a little… worrying. I’ll try to avoid the beans, and I'll definitely make sure my other doctors know. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will escort you to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide the medication list. Dismissed.
PATIENT: .
