DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. It's my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for...a little while now, I suppose. Honestly, I don't have time for this. Just tell me what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. A sore throat. “A little while now” isn’t terribly specific, unfortunately. Can you tell me when it started?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't really remember. Days, maybe? Weeks? It all feels the same these days, if I'm being truthful. I work long hours...separating things, you know. Important things. It's probably just from talking so much. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It matters in the sense that knowing when it started helps me determine the likely cause, and therefore the best course of action. Weeks is rather different than days. And while talking can irritate the throat, it doesn’t usually cause a prolonged sore throat. Let’s try this: Is it getting worse, better, or staying the same?
PATIENT: Staying the same, I think. Mostly. Sometimes it feels a little scratchier, but it doesn't really change. It's just...there. Like a constant annoyance. Look, I don't get sick often, and I really don't have time to sit around figuring out how bad it is. Can't you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: “Something for it” is not a medical plan, Ms. Ottaviani. I need to understand what “it” is before I can prescribe anything appropriate. A sore throat can be caused by any number of things – a virus, bacteria, allergies, even irritation. Giving you medication without knowing the cause could be ineffective, or even harmful. Tell me, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like...what kind of symptoms? I don't...I don't know. I work. I sleep. I eat. That's about it. I haven't been feeling particularly unwell, just this throat. And tired, I suppose. But I'm always tired. Is that what you mean? Honestly, I don’t understand why this is so complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s not about complicated, Ms. Ottaviani. It’s about responsible care. Fatigue is a symptom, yes. Have you had a fever, chills, cough, runny nose, body aches?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. No cough. No runny nose. Just…tired. And this throat, of course. Look, I really need to get back to work. My shift starts soon. Are you going to help me or not? I don’t have all day to answer questions about every little ache and pain. I’m a strong woman, I don’t usually complain.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination, then. I need to listen to your lungs and examine your throat. It’s a standard procedure, even if you feel it’s unnecessary. Please have a seat and lean your head back. I’ll need to use a tongue depressor and a light.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Hurry it up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is mildly erythematous, no visible exudate or tonsillar enlargement. No palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. Your throat is a bit red, but it doesn’t appear severely inflamed. Given your lack of other symptoms, and the fact that it’s been ongoing for weeks, I suspect it may be chronic irritation. Do you smoke or are you exposed to any environmental irritants at work?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. My husband...he smoked. Terrible habit. As for irritants...well, the plant. There's dust, of course. And chemicals, I suppose. We're separating things, like I said. Important things. It's a clean plant, mostly, but it is a factory. Is that what’s causing it? Is that all it is?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible. Chronic exposure to dust and chemicals can cause persistent throat irritation. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities without further investigation. Given your lack of insurance, I want to be judicious with testing. A rapid strep test is relatively inexpensive and can quickly rule out a bacterial infection. Would you be willing to consider that?
PATIENT: A test? Honestly... I don’t know. How long will it take? And what if it is something? I don’t have time for a lot of tests and appointments. I just want something to make the pain go away. Can't you just prescribe something? An antibiotic, maybe? Those always work, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Antibiotics do not always work, Ms. Ottaviani, and prescribing them unnecessarily contributes to antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. The rapid strep test takes only a few minutes. If it’s negative, we can discuss symptomatic treatment – lozenges, throat spray, and ensuring adequate hydration. If it’s positive, then we would need to consider an antibiotic. I strongly recommend the test. It’s a simple way to gain valuable information. It's five minutes of your time, and could prevent a more serious problem later on. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Five minutes, you said? Five minutes and then you give me something for the pain. Don't make me sit here all day. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. This may be slightly uncomfortable. Open wide and say “ahhh.”
PATIENT: Ugh. That’s unpleasant. Are we done yet? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Negative. The rapid strep test is negative. That rules out a bacterial infection. As I suspected, it appears this is likely chronic irritation, possibly due to your work environment. I can prescribe a soothing throat spray with benzocaine to temporarily alleviate the pain. It won't cure the problem, but it should provide some relief. I also recommend drinking plenty of fluids, using throat lozenges, and, if possible, minimizing your exposure to dust and chemicals at work. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. My husband...he was allergic to everything. Pollen, dust, cats... a terrible sufferer. I, thankfully, am not bothered by much. Just get me the spray. The sooner I can get back to work, the better. Is there anything else? Honestly, this has been a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This is a prescription for a benzocaine throat spray. Use as directed on the label. If your symptoms worsen or persist for more than a week despite using the spray, I recommend consulting an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist. I also have some information pamphlets on avoiding irritants and managing sore throats. Given your work environment, it may be beneficial to discuss workplace safety measures with your employer. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just...thank you. I suppose. I really must be going now. .
DOCTOR: Some patients... .
