DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I received a letter regarding the results of a test… a test of my insides, I believe. They said it was… not normal. I’m a little worried, to be frank. Perhaps you could explain what it all means?
DOCTOR: “A test of your insides,” right. Well, “not normal” is… vague, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Indeed it is, Doctor. I apologize for my imprecise language. It was an… endoscopic test, I think they called it. They sent a little camera down… well, you understand. The letter simply stated there were some… abnormalities detected. I wasn’t quite sure what that entailed, and my understanding of medical terms is… limited, shall we say. It’s causing me a bit of anxiety, truthfully.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy… yes, I see it here. August 1st. Okay. And you're concerned about the findings. Right. Well, “abnormalities” can mean a lot of things, Ms. Minatra. It doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. Were you experiencing any symptoms before the test?
PATIENT: Before the test… let me think. Not anything particularly alarming, no. Perhaps a little… discomfort, occasionally, in my stomach. Nothing I couldn’t manage with a cup of chamomile tea, honestly. And a bit of… well, let’s say irregular digestion. But I’m an older woman, Doctor. These things happen. It didn’t seem significant enough to warrant a visit to the doctor, until I received the letter.
DOCTOR: "Irregular digestion"...and how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now, I suppose. Several months, at least. Perhaps six months, maybe longer. It comes and goes, really. Some days I feel perfectly fine, other days… not so much. As I said, it hasn't been debilitating. More of a… nuisance, if you will. I assumed it was just my age, or something I ate. I really didn't think much of it, until this test result.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear… let me see. Not that I’ve noticed, no. Not any bright red blood, certainly. Sometimes, perhaps… a slightly darker shade than usual? But I attributed that to… beets, perhaps? I do enjoy a good beet salad. It's difficult to say, honestly. I don't often… examine things that closely, if you understand. Is that something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Minatra, it is. Darker stool could indicate something. Alright. Let’s get a bit of a physical exam done, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, do let me know if anything feels… unpleasant. I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, if I’m honest, but I understand they’re necessary. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: If you could just lie back for me. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first, then I’ll palpate it—feel around a bit. Just try to relax. And tell me if anything hurts.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall do my best to relax. Though, as I mentioned, I’m not overly fond of this… probing. Please, don’t hesitate to tell me what you are listening for, if you don't mind. It does ease my anxiety somewhat, knowing what to expect. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. Normal bowel sounds, though a little… sluggish. Not alarming, but not ideal. Now, I'm going to press gently on your abdomen. Tell me immediately if you feel any pain. Is this tender at all?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Just there, Doctor. A little bit tender. Not sharp pain, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Is that normal? It’s only when you press, though. I don’t feel it otherwise. It's right around… here.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. That's… interesting. And is there any nausea or vomiting associated with this discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting at all. Just the… discomfort, occasionally, and the irregularity I mentioned. It doesn’t come and go with meals, either. I can eat perfectly fine, and feel alright for hours afterward. Then, suddenly… this ache. It’s very unpredictable, to be honest. It hasn't interfered with my daily life, but it is concerning, now that you’re pointing it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds are still sluggish. Given the tenderness and the sluggishness… and the endoscopy results… I think we need to order some further testing. A complete blood count, and a stool analysis. To rule out infection, and to get a better picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I trust your judgment. A stool analysis, you say? Oh dear… I suppose it’s unavoidable, isn’t it? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Or any specific instructions I should follow? I don’t want to… complicate things. I’m not as agile as I once was, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, there are some instructions. The stool analysis requires a small sample—you’ll receive a kit with specific directions on how to collect it. As for the blood count, just fast for eight hours beforehand. And drink plenty of water. We’ll get the results back in a few days. I’m also going to refer you to a gastroenterologist—a specialist in digestive issues. They’ll be able to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A specialist, you say? Very well. I understand. A gastroenterologist. I suppose it’s best to consult with someone who specializes in these matters. The stool sample… I’m a little apprehensive, I must admit. But if it's necessary, I will manage. Could you perhaps… remind me of the fasting instructions before I leave? Just to be certain I understand correctly. I do tend to be a bit forgetful these days. It’s quite embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Eight hours with nothing to eat or drink except water. No coffee, no tea, no juice… nothing. And try to avoid strenuous activity the day before the tests. We want to get accurate results. Now, I’ll have the lab send over the instructions, just in case. Is there anything else I can address before you go?
PATIENT: Eight hours, nothing but water. Yes, I think I can manage that. And avoid strenuous activity… understood. No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my… anxieties. And my forgetfulness, of course. I’ll be sure to follow the instructions carefully, and I’ll await the results with… anticipation, I suppose. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get those tests scheduled. And Ms. Minatra… try not to worry too much. Often, these things are… nothing serious. But we need to rule things out. Have a good day. And I’ll see you when the results are in.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I shall endeavor to remain calm. And I look forward to hearing from you. Goodbye, Doctor Pitmon. .
