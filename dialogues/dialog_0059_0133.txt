DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just need some papers signed and… well, verified, I guess. Some health forms. It’s a bit of a hassle, really. I don’t have insurance, so everything falls on me to get done. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Melvenia. I understand. It can be quite frustrating navigating things without insurance. We’ll certainly do our best to get these forms completed for you. To ensure I can accurately verify everything, could you tell me a little more about which forms these are for?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… They’re for… a volunteer position at the local animal shelter. They want everything checked, you know? Physical exam, vaccinations… just to make sure I’m healthy enough to handle the animals. It's silly, really. I’ve been perfectly healthy my whole life! But they insist.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of the animal shelter, actually. Ensuring volunteers are healthy protects both you and the animals. It’s not silly at all. Okay, it looks like they are requesting a fairly standard physical exam and a review of your vaccination history. Before we proceed with the exam, let’s go over your medical background a bit. Just to get a comprehensive picture. First, have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really significant ones, no. I had the flu a few times, of course. And I broke my wrist when I was a little girl – fell off a horse! But that was ages ago. Nothing major in… oh, goodness, decades. I haven't been to a hospital in… well, a very long time. Do you need dates? I’m terrible with remembering dates.
DOCTOR: No, dates aren’t crucial right now, Melvenia. Just a general sense is fine. It sounds like you've been quite healthy. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, I suppose. I’ve always tried to stay active, you know? Good food, lots of walking… that sort of thing. Though, I did have my tonsils out when I was very young, but that was so long ago it barely feels like it happened. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, tonsil removal when you were young doesn’t need to be included in surgical history for this purpose, Melvenia. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate with your health. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Not really medications. I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor told me my levels were a bit low last year. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take… well, ibuprofen, I suppose. But that’s it. Nothing regular, if that makes sense. Just things as needed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Melvenia. Vitamin D and ibuprofen as needed. We’ll note that. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to help my mother with her garden, and she grew everything. I handled all sorts of plants, and never had a problem. My skin’s pretty tough, I guess. Though, I don’t like shellfish much… but that’s just a preference, not an allergy! Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a preference for shellfish doesn’t count as an allergy, Melvenia. It’s good to know you haven't experienced any allergic reactions. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother lived to be 95, but she didn't really talk about illnesses much. She was a very stoic woman. My father passed away when I was young, from… I think it was his heart. And my brother… well, he had some trouble with his blood pressure later in life, but I don't know much beyond that. It wasn't a family that talked about health problems, if that makes sense. Everyone just… dealt with things. Is that helpful? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Melvenia. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. Knowing your mother lived to 95 is excellent information, and the history of heart issues and high blood pressure is helpful as well. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with. I just want to get these forms signed and be on my way, if you don’t mind. The animal shelter is expecting them, you know. Little puppies are waiting!
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. We'll get this done as efficiently as possible. First, I'll check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 85. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. And your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds good, and your lungs are clear. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, let’s just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Everything looks good here as well.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn’t so bad. So… is everything alright? Do I need anything? I really don't want to start taking medication if I can avoid it. I'm quite healthy, you know. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is looking quite good overall, Melvenia. Your physical exam was largely normal. The only thing I noted was slightly elevated blood pressure – 140 over 85. It’s not dramatically high, but we should monitor it. Before we discuss next steps, can you tell me if you experience any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. Sometimes, if I haven’t had enough water, I get a little bit of a throbbing feeling, but that’s it. Dizziness… no, I haven’t felt dizzy in years. And my vision is… well, it’s not as sharp as it used to be, but that’s just age, I suppose. I wear glasses, as you can see. But no changes, no blurry spots or anything like that. Nothing that worries me, anyway. Is the blood pressure something serious?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Melvenia. The slightly elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily something to panic about immediately, but it’s worth keeping an eye on. It could be a temporary elevation due to stress or simply the experience of being at the doctor’s office. To get a better understanding, I'd like to recommend checking your blood pressure a few times over the next week at home, if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never needed one before. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, years. Everything was always fine. Would I have to buy one? Is it expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And frankly, I’m not very good with gadgets.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. They can be a bit of an expense, and not everyone is comfortable using them. You can purchase one at most pharmacies for around $30-$50. However, we have a lending program here at the clinic. We can lend you a blood pressure cuff for a week, free of charge, so you can monitor your pressure at home. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh! Really? That would be wonderful, Doctor. That would be a huge help. I appreciate that very much. I can come back next week and return it, then? That sounds perfect. So, what about these forms? Can we get them signed now? The puppies are waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Melvenia. We can definitely get those forms signed. Based on your exam and history, I'm comfortable verifying your health status for the animal shelter. I will note the slightly elevated blood pressure and recommend monitoring it at home. Here you are. I've included a note about the blood pressure monitoring. If your blood pressure consistently reads high at home, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me, and we can discuss it further. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very helpful, Doctor. And thank you for lending me the blood pressure cuff. I really appreciate it. I guess that’s everything. The puppies thank you too! Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Melvenia. Enjoy your time volunteering with the puppies, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: .
