DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 63 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, sixty-three. Well, to be honest, I been feeling… strange lately. I drinking a lot more water than usual, and I always hungry. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need something else. It just don’t seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased thirst and hunger… that is something we need to investigate. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It start maybe… two, three months now? At first, I thought it was just the heat, you know? August is always hot. But it didn't get better when the weather cool down a little. It just keep getting worse, the thirst especially. I does have to refill my glass all the time.
DOCTOR: Two to three months… alright. And besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Other changes… well, now that you ask… I does feel a little tired, more so than usual. I always liked to work in my garden, but lately I get winded real quick. And I been going to the bathroom a lot more often too. Not… nothing bad, just… more times in the day. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Increased urination and fatigue… alright. Now, have you experienced any blurry vision, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Blurry vision? No, not that I notice. My sight always been a little weak, I does wear glasses, as you can see. But it hasn’t gotten worse recently, if that makes sense. Just… the usual. I get them checked every year, you know, by the eye doctor.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you had any unexplained weight loss, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven't been trying to lose weight, but… I think maybe I lost a little bit? My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't stepped on the scale in a while. I don't really bother with scales, you know? I just… eat when I hungry. I don't keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history, Ms. Zicarelli. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I never been told I have anything serious. I does get a little pressure sometimes, but the doctor always tell me it’s just stress. And my heart… well, it beats, doesn't it? I never been to a specialist, nothing like that. Just regular check-ups with the family doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I had a C-section when my daughter was born. That was… fifty years ago now, maybe more. Other than that, nothing. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother, she lived a long life, but she had a little trouble with her sugar. The doctor said it was diabetes, I think. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my sister, she’s healthy too, as far as I know. We don't see each other much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes I does take a little pain reliever for my arthritis, but that’s it. Just when it really bothers me. Nothing else. I try to stay away from pills if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything. I does get bitten by mosquitoes real bad, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, mosquito bites are not an allergy. Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. I think we have enough information for now. I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to find out what’s wrong, you know? I don’t like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll begin with your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. First, let's take your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here you go. Be gentle now, my veins are a little tricky sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. Pulse is 88 and regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but I do note some tenderness in the upper quadrants. No masses palpable. I’d like to order some laboratory tests to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What kind of tests are those, Doctor? Are they going to hurt? I don't like needles, you know. I always faint when they take blood. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Zicarelli, please try not to worry. These are just routine blood and urine tests. The blood tests will give us information about your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and overall health. The urinalysis will check for any signs of infection or other abnormalities in your urine. As for the needle, it will be a quick prick, and the phlebotomist is very experienced. We can have you lie down during the blood draw to prevent you from fainting. It’s standard procedure. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms, and we can proceed accordingly. It’s better to be thorough and rule out any potential problems. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… alright, Doctor. If you say it’s important. I don’t like needles, but… I guess I can try. Can the phlebotomist be extra careful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I just want this all over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Zicarelli. I will make a note of your anxiety regarding the needle. The phlebotomist will be informed to take extra care. As for the results, it typically takes 2-3 business days for the lab to process them. Once they are available, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your water intake and try to eat small, frequent meals. Avoid sugary drinks and processed foods as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Just… please tell the phlebotomist to be gentle, okay? And thank you for being patient with me. I just get so nervous about these things. I’ll try to drink more water and eat better. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Zicarelli. I will personally inform the phlebotomist. And you're very welcome; I understand your anxiety. No, there’s nothing else you need to do before you leave. My nurse will escort you to the lab and assist you with the blood draw. We will be in touch within a few business days to schedule your follow-up. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – such as severe dehydration, confusion, or blurred vision – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I wish you well, Ms. Zicarelli.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything. I’ll try not to worry too much. And… I’ll see you soon, I hope.
