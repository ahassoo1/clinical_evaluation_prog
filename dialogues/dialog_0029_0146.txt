DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… muscle weakness, really. It's been getting worse lately, and figured I should get it checked out before it gets any harder to do things. Don't really know what's causing it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Muscle weakness... and you say it’s been progressively worsening. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, progressively is the right word. It started maybe… three months ago? Just a little harder to lift things, felt tired quicker. Now, getting up from a chair is… a project sometimes. And stairs? Forget about it some days. It’s not constant, you know? Some days are better than others, but it's definitely not going away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months. And it's fluctuating – some days better than others. That’s helpful to know. Is this weakness generalized, meaning all over, or is it more focused in specific areas?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. It’s… mostly in my legs and arms, I think. My legs feel heavier than usual, and my arms get tired really quickly if I'm doing anything repetitive, like… even just washing the car. I haven't noticed it much in my back or anything, just those main muscle groups. It’s hard to explain, honestly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. McKinnon. So, primarily legs and arms. Okay. And when you say “tired quickly,” is that more of a physical fatigue – like the muscles just give out – or more of a general exhaustion?
PATIENT: Definitely the muscles giving out, I think. Like, I feel tired, sure, but it's more that they just...stop working. Like they don’t have the strength. I can be doing something, and halfway through, they just won’t cooperate anymore. It’s not like I’m completely wiped out afterwards, if that makes sense. Just… weak. Really weak.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness specifically in the legs and arms, onset three months ago, fluctuating, and the muscles feel like they “give out” during activity. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think... hmm. Not really, no. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. I've been sleeping okay, eating regular. Maybe a little more clumsy than usual, dropped a few things lately, but I figured that was just me being tired. Nothing major, nothing I could really pinpoint as being connected to the weakness. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Alright, no associated pain, numbness, tingling, or changes in sleep or appetite. A little clumsiness, but not necessarily linked. Have you had any recent illnesses – even a cold or the flu – before this started?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... yeah, actually. I had a really bad cold in… April, I think. Knocked me off my feet for a good week. It was one of those where everything hurt, you know? But I recovered, everything went back to normal… or so I thought. Maybe that’s when it started, just subtle at first and I didn’t notice. I haven't been sick since then.
DOCTOR: Okay. A pretty significant cold in April, potentially coinciding with the onset of these symptoms. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I've had the usual colds and flu, but no major illnesses. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing I take medication for regularly. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that's about it. I try to eat reasonably well and I don't smoke or drink much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known chronic medical conditions, tonsillectomy as a child, and you maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle. Any family history of muscle weakness, neurological conditions, or similar symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My mom had… arthritis, I think. Badly, towards the end. But that was joint pain, not muscle weakness. My grandfather, on my dad’s side, had some memory problems when he got older, but I don’t know what exactly it was. Nothing else really springs to mind, no one else I can think of with similar problems. It’s not something we really talked about much in my family. Does that help? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal grandmother with arthritis, paternal grandfather with memory problems. We’ll make note of that. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, and I’ve never had a reaction. No food allergies, no environmental allergies, nothing like that. I can usually take pretty much anything without issue. Which, to be honest, is probably why I haven’t bothered mentioning it before. I don't have anything to worry about, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, this is all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and range of motion, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? The sooner the better. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you don’t mind, please sit here on the examination table. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll move onto checking your reflexes and muscle strength. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal. Okay, let’s check your strength now. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? Is that enough? It feels… a little weaker than usual, maybe. It’s hard to say, to be honest. I usually have a pretty good grip.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Strength is 4+/5 in both upper extremities. Now, can you push your feet against my hands like this?
PATIENT: Yeah, like that? It's… harder than it should be, I think. My legs just don’t feel as strong as they used to. It takes more effort, definitely. And it feels… a little shaky. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay. Strength is 4/5 in both lower extremities. There is some fatigue noted with sustained resistance, and some mild tremor. Now, can you stand up and walk for me, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like that? I… feel a little unsteady, I guess. Not enough to fall, but… it takes more concentration than it should. And my legs feel a little heavy. Is that obvious? It’s hard to describe. I don’t want to make a fuss, but… it’s definitely not how I normally walk.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some mild instability and a slightly wider gait. Okay, please sit back down. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings – the fluctuating weakness, the mild tremor, and the instability during walking – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to the viral illness you had a few months back, causing some post-viral fatigue and weakness. It could also be indicative of a nerve issue or, less likely, a muscle disorder. To rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. We’ll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and some markers for inflammation and muscle enzymes. I’d also like to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever it takes to figure it out. Blood work sounds fine. I just want to know what's going on and, hopefully, get back to normal. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain things. Let’s get the blood work done. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, for this panel, I would like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. We'll have the lab draw the samples first thing in the morning. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, try to avoid overexerting yourself, and if you notice any worsening of your symptoms, or if you develop new symptoms like difficulty breathing, double vision, or severe fatigue, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything pretty well, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours, avoid overexerting myself, and come back if things get worse. I can manage that. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. We'll get those tests scheduled for you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try to rest.
