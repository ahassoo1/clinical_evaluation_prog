DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. Yes, well. It's about my… business. Went to the bathroom this morning and there was… red. In the stool. Not a good sign, I imagine. Though what is a good sign these days? Everything's falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Red in the stool. I understand. That certainly warrants a look. When you say “red,” can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Good heavens. It was… red. Like, blood. What do you want me to do, get out a paint swatch? It wasn’t a little streak, mind you. It was… noticeable. Enough to make a fella concerned, anyway. I've seen things in my time, flown all over the world, but this… this is unsettling. And frankly, I don’t appreciate having to describe it. Is that what they train doctors for these days? To ask silly questions?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if my questions seem silly. It's just that “red” can mean a lot of different things – bright red, dark red, mixed in, coating the stool… It helps me narrow down the possibilities. Was it bright red, more like a fresh color?
PATIENT: Fresh color? Are you an artist now, Doctor? Look, it was… alarming. Not a pale pink. Not brownish. Just… red. Like when you cut yourself, only… well, you know. Coming from the other end. I don’t need a color analysis, I need to know what’s wrong with me! And don’t tell me it's stress, either. I’ve handled worse than a little bit of blood. Flew through a typhoon once, now that was stressful.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to want answers, Mr. Rowbottom, and I’m going to do my best to find them. It sounds like it was bright red blood, and that’s helpful. Now, did it coat the stool, or was it mixed in with it?
PATIENT: Mixed in. Yes. Definitely mixed in. Not just… sitting on top. Throughout. Like… well, like strawberry jam, if you absolutely must have a comparison. Though I haven't had a good strawberry jam in years. My ex-wife made a terrible batch, always too runny. Point is, it wasn’t separate. It was in there. And a fair amount of it, I might add. I’m not a small man, but I noticed. It wasn't a trace.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you for clarifying. And I apologize again for the… line of questioning. Now, have you experienced any pain or discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not exactly. A little… pressure, maybe. Beforehand. But nothing you’d write home about. I’ve had stubbed toes that hurt more. And I certainly haven’t been screaming about it. I'm a pilot, Doctor. We don't scream. Though sometimes… sometimes you just want to yell at the clouds. But that's beside the point. No real pain. Just… awareness. And the unfortunate discovery afterwards.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. And when was the last time you had a normal bowel movement, before this episode?
PATIENT: Normal? Good heavens. Let me think. I suppose… two days ago. Yes. Two days. It wasn’t… spectacular, mind you. But it was… regular. As regular as things get these days. I used to be… more reliable, let’s put it that way. Before all the… changes. And the divorce. Everything just seems to be falling apart, you know? Even my insides.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? My eyesight’s going, my knees ache, my ex-wife keeps calling… You’ll have to be more specific, Doctor. I’m not a fortune teller. Are you asking about… other things coming out the other end? Because frankly, I don't think I need to elaborate on that. Just the blood. Worrying enough as it is.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to keep me focused, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize. Let me rephrase. Have you felt any weakness or fatigue lately?
PATIENT: Weakness? Fatigue? Well, I'm eighty-eight years old, Doctor! Of course I'm fatigued. I haven't got the energy I used to have. Don't you think a man my age is allowed to be a little tired? It’s called getting old! Now, is this blood something serious or isn’t it? That's what I want to know. I haven't got all day to describe my general state of decay.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask that, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concern. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your abdomen and taking your vital signs. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Hmph. An exam. Well, I suppose so. Can't hurt to poke around, I suppose. Though I doubt you'll find anything. I've been through worse. Still… get on with it. The sooner we figure out what’s wrong, the sooner I can get out of here. And please, no unnecessary questions. I’ve told you all I'm going to tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Just going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Everything sounds good there. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Does that cause you any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. A little… firm, maybe. But I haven't had a flat stomach since nineteen-fifty-something. Can't say it's painful. Just… solid. Like a well-worn suitcase. Though I've had better suitcases, I must admit. Go on. Get it over with. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? I'm a delicate flower, you know. Despite appearances.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m noticing a little tenderness here, on your lower left side. Nothing too alarming, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are a little quiet, but that could be normal. Alright. That's all for now.
PATIENT: Quiet bowel sounds? Just what I needed to hear. Everything's falling apart. Alright, Doctor. What’s it all mean? Are you going to send me home to die, or is there something you can do about this? Don't tell me it’s stress, though. I've dealt with worse. Much worse. Now, spit it out. I haven’t got all day. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit… faint.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, please try to relax. You’re not going home to die. But I do want to investigate this further. The blood in your stool, combined with the tenderness in your abdomen and the quiet bowel sounds, could indicate a few different things. It could be something relatively minor, like a diverticulitis flare-up – small pouches in the colon getting inflamed. Or it could be something more serious. To be sure, I’d like to order a couple of tests. A complete blood count to check for infection and anemia, and a stool test to rule out any bacteria. I also recommend a colonoscopy – a camera examination of your colon – to get a good look and rule out anything concerning. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Good heavens. A camera? Up… up there? I’ve flown through storms, navigated treacherous airspace, faced down engine failures… but a camera up my… colon? That sounds… unpleasant. And a blood test? Fine. I suppose. But a colonoscopy… Absolutely not. I'm too old for that. Too delicate. Besides, I’ve heard stories. I’d rather take my chances. Are you sure you can't just tell me what’s wrong without poking around? It's probably just something I ate. A bad oyster, maybe. Yes, that’s it. A bad oyster.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your hesitation. It’s a perfectly natural fear. But a colonoscopy is the best way to get a definitive answer and rule out anything serious, like polyps or, in rare cases, cancer. It’s a very safe procedure, and we take every precaution to make you comfortable. You'd be sedated, so you wouldn’t feel a thing. However, I respect your wishes. While I strongly recommend it, I won’t force you to do anything you’re not comfortable with. We can start with the blood count and stool tests, and then reassess based on the results. But please understand, without a colonoscopy, we may not be able to get a clear diagnosis, and that could delay getting you the appropriate treatment if something is there. Would you be open to discussing it further with a specialist?
PATIENT: A specialist? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, you’re giving me a panic attack. All I asked for was someone to tell me why there was blood in my stool, not a full medical investigation. I'm eighty-eight years old! I've had a good life. I’ve seen things. Perhaps it's just… my time. No, thank you to the specialist. And no thank you to the camera. Just the blood tests, then. The fewest possible probes. And if it turns out I’m dying, I want a good brandy. That’s my condition. Now, are we done? I need to lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll start with the blood count and stool tests, as you requested. I’ll get the orders written up now. And I’ll make a note of your request for a good brandy. If the results come back concerning, we can certainly discuss that. I'm also going to write you a referral for a palliative care consultation, just to have someone assess your overall health and ensure you’re as comfortable as possible. They can help with symptom management and address any concerns you might have, regardless of the test results. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Palliative care? Is that… for people who are… giving up? No. No palliative care. I am not giving up. I may be old, and I may have a bit of blood in my stool, but I am not ready to lie down and wait for the end. I still have things to do. I still have stories to tell. Just the blood tests, Doctor. Please. Just the blood tests. And perhaps… perhaps a prescription for something to settle my stomach. It’s been rather upset lately. That’s all I want. No cameras. No specialists. No… end-of-life planning. Just help me feel a little bit better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Mr. Rowbottom. That is not too much to ask. I apologize for upsetting you. We will absolutely focus on getting you feeling better. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and a prescription for something to settle your stomach. I won't push for anything you’re not comfortable with. But please, if your symptoms worsen or you change your mind about the specialist, don't hesitate to call. Here you are. The lab is just down the hall. And this prescription is for an antacid. It should help with your stomach. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. Just… get me out of here. I need to lie down. And… and a good brandy. A very good brandy. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… patient.
DOCTOR:
