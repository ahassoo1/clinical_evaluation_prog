DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… what did I come for? My daughter, she wrote it down for me. Let me think… it's something with going to the bathroom. It's hard, you know? Like it takes a long time, and doesn't all come out. Does that make sense? I forget things so easily these days.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Zoie. It sounds frustrating, and it's very common to have changes like that as we get older. So, you’re saying it’s taking you a long time to empty your bladder, and you feel like you’re not completely emptying it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Emptying… that’s the word. It just… takes effort. And sometimes I have to go back again not long after. It’s a bit of a bother, really. Not painful, just… slow and incomplete. I don't know if that helps. My husband says I drink too much tea, maybe that's it?
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. And it's good you've noticed that it's not painful. Your husband might be onto something with the tea – caffeine can sometimes contribute to those kinds of issues. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how often you're finding you need to go to the bathroom during the day?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how often? That’s a tricky one. I don’t really count. I suppose… more than I used to. Before, I could go for hours. Now… maybe every couple of hours? Sometimes less, sometimes a bit more. I really don’t keep track, sorry. It just feels like a lot. My daughter would know better, she notices these things. She's very good.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Zoie. It's perfectly alright that you don't keep track. “More than you used to” is very helpful information. And it's wonderful that your daughter is so attentive. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Urine? Changes… hmm. Let me think. I haven’t really looked, if you know what I mean. I just go. I suppose… it looks normal? You know, yellow-ish? I can’t say I’ve seen any blood or anything like that. I’m not one for checking, sorry. Is it important to check? It sounds a bit strange.
DOCTOR: It's not strange at all to not routinely check, Zoie, and I certainly wouldn’t ask you to do something you’re not comfortable with. I was just checking to see if you had noticed any changes in colour or smell, but if it looks and seems normal to you, that's good. Now, have you been having any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I get up at night sometimes to go. Not every night, but maybe two or three times a week. That didn't used to happen. And… my legs feel a little swollen sometimes, especially at the end of the day. But I thought that was just getting old. Is that a symptom? It's hard to know what's what these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting up at night to urinate more often, and some swelling in your legs. Those could definitely be related, and it's good you mentioned them. Swelling in the legs can be related to kidney or bladder issues, but it can also have other causes. Now, just to cover everything, have you experienced any fever, chills, or any pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no pain in my back or sides. Not at all. Everything is… achy sometimes, you know, old age again. But not proper pain. Just… tiredness, mostly. I sleep a lot. And I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast sometimes, but I've always been a bit like that. I don't think that's connected, is it?
DOCTOR: No, I wouldn’t automatically connect the dizziness, Zoie. It sounds like you've had that for a while. Okay, good. No fever, no chills, no back pain. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your tummy, feel your abdomen, and check your legs for swelling. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. I trust you, Doctor. Yes, you can check. It’s just a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? But if it helps… go ahead. Just be gentle, please. My skin is a bit thin.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie, I will be very gentle. Okay. If you could lie down on your back for me, that would be great. Okay, I’m listening now. Everything sounds normal in your tummy, no unusual noises. And I do feel a little swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It's mild, but it's there. Now, I’m just going to ask a couple of quick questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that's a long time ago now. Let me think… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, but I don’t take anything for it. He said just watch my salt intake. And… I think I had a little bit of arthritis in my hands. But nothing serious. I saw a specialist for a while, but it didn’t really help, so I stopped going. Diabetes? I don’t think so. My mother had it, but I never did. Everything is a bit of a blur, honestly. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Zoie. It’s very common for things to become a bit fuzzy with time. So, high blood pressure, managed with diet, and some arthritis in your hands. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalised for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that was a long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy when I was younger. That was… quite a while ago now. And… I was in hospital once with pneumonia, but that was years and years ago. Just a bad chest infection. Nothing else that I can think of. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Zoie, thank you. Tonsils out, hysterectomy, and pneumonia. I’m not going to worry about the pneumonia. Now, just one more part of the history, and then we’ll get to thinking about what’s going on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just a little bit of paracetamol sometimes for aches and pains, you know? And a vitamin D tablet in the winter. The doctor said everyone should take one. But that's it. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Makes me feel a bit funny. My husband reminds me to take the vitamin D, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, just paracetamol occasionally for aches and pains, and vitamin D in the winter. That’s good to know. And no allergies to any medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with any medicines. I used to be able to take anything. It’s funny how things change, isn't it? I can't remember much these days, but I know I've never had a bad reaction to a pill.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Zoie. Okay, so to summarise: you’ve been having difficulty emptying your bladder, feeling like it’s incomplete, and needing to go more often, especially at night. You have a history of high blood pressure and a hysterectomy, and you take occasional paracetamol and vitamin D. You're not allergic to any medications. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further to figure out what’s going on. There are a few possibilities, and it’s important to get a clear diagnosis. I'd like to order a urine sample to check for infection, and a blood test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… I don’t like tests. But if it helps… alright. You’re the doctor. What do I have to do? Just… tell me. A urine sample… is that easy? And a blood test… will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious about tests, Zoie. It’s very common. The urine sample is quite easy. I’ll give you a sterile container and you just need to provide a sample when you next go to the bathroom. There are instructions on how to do it properly. We just need a small amount, mid-stream. The blood test will involve a small needle prick in your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and it's over very quickly. The nurse is very good, and will minimise any discomfort. We only need a small amount of blood. I’ll write you a request form for both tests, and you can take it to the lab just down the hall. They’ll organise everything from there. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A little pinch… I suppose I can manage that. And a little cup for the… you know. It sounds alright. Just down the hall, you say? It’s not too far. My legs aren't very good sometimes. And what happens after the tests? Do I have to wait a long time for the results? I don't like waiting. My daughter is very good at checking things, maybe she can help. She's very patient. Would they tell her the results, if she asked?
DOCTOR: That’s right, just down the hall. It's a very short walk, and you can take your time. And yes, we can absolutely have your daughter involved. She’s very welcome to call the clinic with you to discuss the results, or I can speak to her directly with your permission. We’ll get the results back within a few days, usually. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d recommend drinking around 1.5 to 2 litres of water each day – unless your doctor has told you otherwise – and trying to avoid caffeine and alcohol. It’s also helpful to avoid bladder irritants like citrus fruits and spicy foods. For now, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your lower back or sides, please call the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright, Zoie?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Water, no caffeine, no spicy foods. My daughter will be very good at remembering all of that. And I’ll remember to call if I feel poorly. So… I just go and get the tests done, and then wait for you to call? It’s not too complicated, is it? I get a bit confused sometimes. My daughter always says I worry too much. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Zoie. And no, it’s not complicated at all. Just go to the lab down the hall, tell them you're here for a urine sample and blood tests, and they'll take care of everything. Don't worry about a thing. It's perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, and I'm here to help every step of the way. Here’s the request form. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, even if it's just to check in. Have a lovely day, Zoie. And I'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
