DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit personal, truthfully. I’m dating someone, and I want to be… thorough. One doesn’t simply jump into these things, you know? Especially at my age. I need to make sure everything is as it should be.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Pandolfi. Being proactive about your health is always a good idea, and that's very responsible of you. "Thorough" is excellent. We can certainly do that. To start, could you tell me a little more about what specifically you'd like to be "thorough" about?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose the usual things. I want to make certain I don’t have anything… communicable. And I haven't had a proper check-up in… honestly, far too long. I’d like to know my numbers, if you will. Cholesterol, blood sugar, all of that. It's just… peace of mind, really. One has to be sensible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very sensible approach. We can definitely do a comprehensive check-up, including screening for sexually transmitted infections – STIs – and a general health assessment with those "numbers" you mentioned – cholesterol, blood sugar, and other important markers. To start with the STI screening, have you had any previous testing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, years ago, with my… late husband. A very long time ago. It was all quite standard, I assume. I honestly don’t recall the specifics. One doesn't dwell on such things, does one? It was… a different era. I suppose I’m starting from scratch now. I certainly haven’t had anything done recently.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Pandolfi. That's perfectly alright. We'll treat this as a fresh start then. We'll want to perform a full panel of tests, just to be safe. Now, regarding those “numbers,” do you have any family history of diabetes, heart disease, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Let me think. My mother... she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my uncle, on her side, he had… something with his heart. He wasn't very forthcoming about his health, truthfully. Very stubborn man. My father… he was always perfectly healthy. Ate whatever he wanted and never exercised a day in his life. Though, he passed rather suddenly, so perhaps that wasn’t as good as it seemed. It was a stroke, I believe. A very regrettable situation. It’s difficult to recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pandolfi. That’s helpful to know. A family history of high blood pressure and heart disease does increase your risk, so we'll definitely want to take a closer look. Before we proceed with the tests, could you tell me about any allergies you have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I think I had a mild reaction to penicillin once, many years ago. Just a rash, nothing serious. And… dust. I am rather sensitive to dust, but I wouldn't call it an allergy, exactly. More of an… annoyance. I sneeze a great deal, particularly when cleaning. Aside from that, no, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I eat everything, thankfully. One must enjoy life, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, a mild reaction to penicillin and dust sensitivity noted. That's good information to have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just my blood pressure medication. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. A small dose, thankfully. And… I take a multivitamin every morning. Just a standard one, from the drugstore. Nothing fancy. My neighbor suggested it, said it would give me more energy. Though, I haven't noticed much difference, truthfully. That’s it. No herbal supplements or anything else. I’m a rather simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and a daily multivitamin. Excellent. Just to confirm, no other medications at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I assure you. Sometimes I take an antacid, if I eat something particularly rich, but that’s only very occasionally. Really. I’m quite… regular in my habits, you see. I don't believe in filling my body with unnecessary things. It’s a matter of principle.
DOCTOR: Very good, Ms. Pandolfi. I appreciate you being so thorough. Alright, before we move on to a physical exam, can you briefly tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Goodness. What exactly do you mean by that, Doctor? Am I being interrogated? I’m a married woman. Been married for… well, a very long time. Before my late husband, and now with my current partner. I don’t partake in any… vices. And I certainly don't go gallivanting about. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize if I phrased that poorly. “Social history” is simply a way for me to understand your lifestyle a bit better. It includes things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and your typical level of physical activity. It's not an interrogation, I assure you. It just helps me provide the best possible care. Do you currently smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no. Never. I find the very idea… distasteful. My mother smoked, and it was a terrible habit. Made her cough incessantly. And the smell… simply dreadful. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I doubt I ever will. It's a foolish and unhealthy practice, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s wonderful to hear. And what about alcohol, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Well, I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week. A very small glass. More for politeness, truthfully. My partner enjoys a bit more, but I prefer to keep it to a minimum. It doesn't agree with me, you see. Makes me rather… flushed. Nothing excessive, Doctor. I assure you. I’m not a… party girl.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional small glass of wine. That’s good to know. Finally, can you tell me a little about your typical level of physical activity?
PATIENT: Physical activity… hmm. Well, I do enjoy a leisurely stroll in the garden, when the weather permits. And I do the housework, of course. It’s quite strenuous, actually. Lots of bending and lifting. I don’t partake in any… vigorous exercise, if that’s what you’re asking. I find it rather undignified. I'm not one for gyms or running or anything of that nature. I prefer a more… refined lifestyle. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, that’s perfectly satisfactory. So, leisurely walks, housework… that gives me a good general idea. Now, to proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. We'll just check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general appearance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Though I must warn you, my blood pressure may be slightly elevated. I do tend to get anxious in medical settings. It's just… needles, you know? And the thought of all those germs. But proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. We’ll do everything as gently and efficiently as possible. And don't worry about the anxiety – it's perfectly normal. We'll try to keep things calm. First, let’s just take your blood pressure while you're seated. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: There you are. Though I must confess, I had a rather large cup of tea this morning. And a biscuit or two. It may affect the reading. I do enjoy a little treat with my morning beverage. But please, proceed. I’m ready, as I can be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Pandolfi. Just relax. Don't cross your legs. Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, as you suspected. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me...and exhale.
PATIENT: There. Is everything alright, Doctor? It always feels a bit… intrusive, doesn’t it? Listening to one’s insides. I do hope there are no… alarming sounds. My late husband always had a very strong heartbeat. It was quite reassuring, actually. But I haven’t had a proper check-up in ages, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Ms. Pandolfi, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily a cause for concern, but we’ll want to investigate it further with an echocardiogram, just to be on the safe side. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open your mouth for me, please. Say "Ah."
PATIENT: “Ah…” There. Everything seems perfectly normal, doesn't it? I always brush my teeth twice a day. And I use mouthwash. Though, I must admit, I do have a rather sensitive gag reflex. Please be quick, if you would. It’s rather unpleasant, you know. And I don't want to… make a mess.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good in your throat and ears, Ms. Pandolfi. No redness or swelling. Now, finally, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just lie back and relax. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any pain or tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. Everything feels… perfectly normal. Though, I must admit, I had a rather substantial lunch. A small roast chicken with potatoes and gravy. It may affect the reading, you know. I do enjoy a good meal. But no pain, Doctor. Absolutely none. Just… a full stomach, perhaps. Is that a concern?
DOCTOR: No, a full stomach is perfectly normal, Ms. Pandolfi. Everything feels fine. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found, I recommend a few things. We'll need to run some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid panel – to get a more detailed picture of your overall health. We'll also need to schedule an echocardiogram to investigate that murmur I heard. And, given your history and your new relationship, I recommend screening for sexually transmitted infections. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Thoroughness is key, as I’ve said. I trust your judgment entirely. It's best to be safe, especially at my age. Can all of that be done here, at this clinic? And… how long will it take? I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I wouldn’t want to miss it. Mrs. Abernathy is bringing her famous lemon squares. It’s a very important engagement.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, all of that can be done here at the clinic. We have a lab on site, and we can schedule the echocardiogram with our cardiology department next week. The blood work should take about 24-48 hours to process. The echocardiogram… let me see… we can get you in on Wednesday afternoon. That would give the lab time to complete the blood work, and we can discuss the results together then. Does Wednesday afternoon work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday afternoon would be… acceptable, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I do have a rather sensitive constitution. I tend to get queasy in medical settings. And I dislike hospitals immensely. Are you certain the echocardiogram won’t be… invasive? I’ve heard terrible stories. And I would appreciate it if it didn’t interfere with my bridge club meeting. Mrs. Abernathy’s lemon squares are simply divine.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Pandolfi. The echocardiogram is completely non-invasive. It's a painless procedure that uses sound waves to create a picture of your heart. There are no needles or incisions involved. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe around your chest. It takes about 30-60 minutes. We can schedule it for early Wednesday afternoon, so you'll have plenty of time to make it to your bridge club meeting. And we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… satisfactory, Doctor. Early Wednesday afternoon, then. As long as it doesn’t interfere with Mrs. Abernathy’s lemon squares. I do appreciate your reassurance. It’s… comforting to know I’m in capable hands. And what about the STI screening? Is that also a… painless procedure? I must admit, I’m rather squeamish.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. The STI screening is also very straightforward. For many of the tests, we just need a urine sample – completely painless. For others, we may need a quick blood draw, which is a small prick – similar to the blood work we're already doing. It’s very quick and we will be as gentle as possible. We can schedule that to be done at the same time as the other blood work, so you won’t have to come in multiple times. So, to recap, we'll do the blood work – including the STI screening – this week, and schedule the echocardiogram for Wednesday afternoon. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. Blood work and STI screening this week, echocardiogram on Wednesday. You’ve put my mind at ease, thankfully. And… will I need to fast for the blood work? I do enjoy a substantial breakfast. And what about my medications? Should I take them as usual? I don’t want to… complicate things. It’s best to be precise, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks except water. But you can continue taking your Lisinopril as usual – do not stop taking your medications unless I specifically instruct you to. We'll give you detailed instructions with the lab order. And, if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You've been most thorough and reassuring. I appreciate your patience and understanding. And I'm glad you take my concerns seriously. It's… comforting to know there are still doctors who do. Thank you. I suppose I'll see you on Wednesday then. I trust you’ll remember about Mrs. Abernathy’s lemon squares? Just a little reminder.
DOCTOR: I absolutely will, Ms. Pandolfi. Mrs. Abernathy’s lemon squares are now firmly imprinted in my memory. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. We'll take excellent care of you. Please, have a pleasant day, and I look forward to seeing you on Wednesday. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before then.
