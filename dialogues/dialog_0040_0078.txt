DOCTOR: Right. Aeisha Pitzel, 45. Okay. Well, don’t just sit there. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Osga. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I feel like I need a… a reset, perhaps? Or a jumpstart. I’m just not feeling myself lately. It’s not any one thing, really. Just… sluggish, I suppose. And not very motivated. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: A “reset”?
PATIENT: Yes. It sounds silly when I say it out loud, I know. But that’s the best way I can put it. I feel… worn down. Like the batteries are low. I have energy, I think, but it takes so much effort to actually do anything. It’s been going on for a few months now, maybe six, and it’s starting to affect… everything, really. My work, spending time with my husband… even just getting out of bed in the morning.
DOCTOR: Six months of… feeling “low battery”?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately. It didn't happen suddenly. It was gradual, you see? At first, I just attributed it to being busy. Work has been demanding. But it hasn’t gotten any better, and now… well, now it’s concerning me. I used to be very active, enjoyed gardening, cooking elaborate meals. Now, I mostly just want to sit and… and do nothing. I apologize for being so vague. It’s hard to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see… any recent changes in your… lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… hmm. Let me think. Not major ones, no. My husband and I celebrated our 20th anniversary last year, which was lovely, but didn’t really disrupt things. Work has been consistently busy, as I said. I suppose I haven't been sleeping as well lately. Not nightmares, exactly, just… restless. I toss and turn a bit. And I probably haven’t been eating as healthily as I should, relying on quicker meals because I’m tired. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Restless sleep and quick meals. Groundbreaking. Any… family history of, shall we say, this?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a good question. My mother always had… low energy. She attributed it to being a mother, and working full-time, but she was often tired, and… not very motivated, either. She didn't see a doctor much, though. She just… lived with it, I suppose. My father was very healthy, very active, right up until he passed. So… perhaps on my mother’s side, yes. But I don't know of any specific diagnoses. Is that what you're asking?
DOCTOR: Vague family history of… being tired. Wonderful. And you say you're not on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications at all. I generally try to avoid them if I can. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. Though, to be honest, I haven't found anything that's really helped this time. I've tried chamomile tea, getting more sunlight, even a little bit of extra exercise, but nothing seems to make a significant difference. I really am hoping you can figure out what's going on. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam. Basic vitals, listen to your heart and lungs… just to rule out anything obvious. Please, sit up on the exam table. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I will try to relax. It’s just… I haven't been to a doctor in quite a while, so I'm a little apprehensive. But I trust your expertise. Where would you like me to begin?
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… normal. A bit fast, but likely due to anxiety. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Pulse is… regular. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities there. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again. Lungs are clear. No wheezing, no crackling. Resonance is normal. Everything sounds alright. Honestly, physically, you seem perfectly healthy. Which, frankly, makes this all the more… frustrating.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It is frustrating, isn't it? It’s just… disheartening to hear that everything appears normal when I feel so… unwell. Perhaps it's something else then? Something… internal? I really appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination, even if it didn’t reveal anything obvious. What do you suggest we do next? Perhaps some blood work?
DOCTOR: Blood work. Yes, alright. We’ll do a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests… the usual. Rule out anemia, diabetes, thyroid issues… just to be thorough. But honestly, I suspect this is all… stress-related. The nurse will draw the samples. It'll be a few days before we get the results. Try to get some rest. And perhaps… lower your expectations. You're probably just a bit overwhelmed.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. Stress is certainly a possibility. My work can be demanding, as I mentioned. I will try to… manage my expectations, as you suggest. And I will try to rest. Thank you for ordering the blood work. I will wait to hear from the nurse about scheduling that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: No. Just… try not to worry. And if you start feeling… significantly worse, come back. But honestly, I doubt it'll come to that. The nurse will be in shortly. Next patient.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I appreciate your attention. I’ll wait for the nurse, then. Goodbye.
