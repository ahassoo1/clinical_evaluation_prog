DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t really have a lot of time, so I’ll get straight to it. I've been bruising… a lot easier than usual. I’m on a blood thinner, and it seems worse lately. It's kinda worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising easily, especially when you’re already on a blood thinner, definitely warrants a closer look. “Lately” is helpful – can you give me a bit more detail on that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… maybe the last month or so? It used to be just the occasional bump, you know, if I walked into something. But now it feels like anything – even a little pressure – leaves a mark. And the marks themselves are… bigger, I guess. Darker. I don’t remember them being this bad before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month of increased bruising, larger and darker marks… that’s good information. And you said you're already on a blood thinner?
PATIENT: Yep. Warfarin. Been on it for… oh gosh, almost five years now. Something with my heart, but honestly, I don’t remember all the details. The specialist handles that. I just take the pills and get my blood tested regularly.
DOCTOR: Right, Warfarin for five years. And you do have regular blood tests to check how well it's working, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, every month. They check the… the numbers. INR, I think it’s called. It's usually pretty stable, but I haven’t had a test in, like, two weeks. Maybe that’s it? I don’t know. I just noticed the bruising and figured I should get it checked. I really need to get back to work, so if it's nothing serious…
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re due for an INR check in the next couple of weeks. It’s good you're aware of that. It could be related to the Warfarin being a bit off, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. No bleeding gums, nosebleeds, anything like that. I haven't felt weak or dizzy or anything. Just the bruising. It’s mostly on my arms and legs, but I think I saw a little bit on my stomach yesterday. It’s weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other bleeding, no dizziness or weakness – that's helpful to know. And the bruising is mostly on your arms and legs, with a bit on your stomach. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Besides the heart condition that led to the Warfarin, have you been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Honestly, I don't go to the doctor much unless I have to. I had… strep throat as a kid, maybe? And I broke my wrist once, but that was ages ago. I’m pretty healthy, usually. I eat okay, try to walk when I can, you know. Nothing major. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No, we'll try not to keep you long. Just trying to get a full picture. So, no other significant medical history. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Like I said, I mostly just avoid doctors. It’s… not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family... is there anyone in your family with a history of bleeding problems or easy bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family's… spread out. And a lot of them… aren’t around anymore. I don't really know much about their medical stuff, to be honest. My mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa… he had something with his heart, but I don’t remember what. No one specifically talked about bleeding problems though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of bleeding problems. Let’s talk a little bit about your current medications. Besides the Warfarin, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Just the Warfarin. And sometimes Tylenol for headaches, but that’s it. Really. I try to avoid taking too much of anything. It just feels… safer that way. Is this getting somewhere? I mean, is it something serious? I really need to know if I can go back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Warfarin and occasional Tylenol. You’re right to ask if we’re getting somewhere. We've ruled out a lot, and it does sound like it could be related to your Warfarin dosage. To be sure, though, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a quick look at your arms and legs to assess the bruising, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs, just as a precaution. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds fine. Just… quick, please? I have a meeting at two, and I'm already late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick is the plan. Alright. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. The bruising on your arms is… noticeable. It’s varying in color, which suggests some are older than others. There’s also some on your lower legs, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of anything else going on, but given your history with Warfarin, and the fact that you're due for a blood test, I think the best course of action is to get that INR checked immediately. I'm going to write you a lab order now.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That sounds reasonable. So, it’s probably just the Warfarin, then? Is it something I need to worry about, or will adjusting the pills fix it? I really don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: It’s likely related to the Warfarin, yes. But we can’t be certain without the INR results. Adjusting the dosage might fix it, but it's crucial to know where your levels are first. We absolutely don't want you ending up in the hospital. I'm going to write a note for the lab to prioritize the test. Once you have the results, you can either call me directly, or have the lab fax them to my office. I'll review them and let you know what adjustments, if any, need to be made. In the meantime, avoid any activities that could cause injury, and try to avoid taking any new medications, even over-the-counter ones, without checking with me first. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Get the blood test done ASAP, call you with the results, don't get hurt. That’s pretty much it, right? Can I go now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly it. Get the blood test done as soon as possible, call me with the results, and avoid activities that could cause injury. Here's the lab order. Yes, you can absolutely go now. Thank you for coming in today, Courtnye. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before you get those results. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. Have a good day, and please take care.
