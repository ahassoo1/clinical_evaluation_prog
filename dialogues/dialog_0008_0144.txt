DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, honestly? I just...thought I'd see what all the fuss is about. My friend, Eun-hae, she’s been coming here for years, raving about you. Said I should get checked out, even though I feel perfectly fine. It's probably nothing, really. I just figured, why not? Old age, you know. Things start to...go.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you coming in, Ms. Calvery, and I'm glad to hear Eun-hae speaks so highly of the clinic. It's always good to be proactive about your health, even if you're feeling well. “Things starting to go,” as you say, is a pretty common feeling as we get older. Let’s start with a general overview. Can you tell me a little bit about why Eun-hae suggested you come in specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, she mostly just worries, that one. Always has. Said I should get my…numbers checked? Something about cholesterol, I think? And blood pressure. Honestly, I don’t remember the specifics. She gets very detailed, and I tend to tune her out after a bit. It all sounds…important, but I haven't felt any different. I still cook just fine, and I can walk around the market without getting winded. So, I'm not sure what the big deal is. Is it something serious, Doctor? I really don’t want to have to change my diet. I make a lovely kimchi jjigae.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re active and feeling well. And a lovely kimchi jjigae sounds wonderful – no need to jump to dietary changes just yet. Eun-hae is right to suggest checking your numbers – cholesterol and blood pressure are important indicators of your overall health, and often don't have symptoms until something serious happens. To get a better picture, let's go through some basics. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, my husband, bless his soul, he had…something with his heart. Years ago. But I don’t know the details, it was a long time ago. And I had my gallbladder out, must be twenty years ago now. Other than that…no, I don't really get sick. A little arthritis in my hands, but who doesn't these days? I don't take anything regularly, except for a little ibuprofen when my hands are bothering me. Oh! And vitamins. A general multivitamin, you know, the kind everyone takes. Does that count? Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore things until they go away. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Husband with heart issues and gallbladder removal twenty years ago – noted. A little arthritis and ibuprofen as needed, plus a multivitamin. Ignoring things until they go away is… fairly common, Ms. Calvery, but as we get older, it’s better to be proactive. Let's talk about your family history a bit more, since your husband had heart issues. Did anyone else in your family have heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history…that’s a tough one. My family…we didn’t really talk about health much when I was growing up. It wasn't considered polite. My mother, she died young, from…I think it was a fever? A bad flu, maybe? I don't remember. My father lived a long time, but he was a farmer, very stoic. He didn’t complain about anything. He probably had all sorts of aches and pains, but he never mentioned them. As for my siblings… well, my brother moved to America a long time ago, and we lost touch. My sister…she had something with her stomach, I think. But again, I don’t recall the details. It was all a very long time ago, and frankly, I wasn't very interested in medical things even then. Sorry I can’t be more helpful, Doctor. I really am terrible with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Calvery. It’s not always easy to recall family history, and it sounds like it wasn’t something openly discussed. We can work with what you do remember. Let's shift gears then. Could you tell me a little bit about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Oh, my routine? Well, it’s not very exciting, Doctor. I wake up, usually around seven, have a little coffee and toast. I used to make a proper Korean breakfast every day, but it’s just me now, so I don’t bother much. Then I usually go for a walk to the market – I like to pick out my vegetables fresh. I spend most of the day at home, reading or watching TV. I cook dinner, of course – I still enjoy that. And then I go to bed. Pretty simple, really. I don’t travel much anymore. Too much hassle. My friend, Eun-hae, she’s always trying to get me to go on trips with her, but I just don't have the energy for it. It’s a quiet life, but it suits me. I do volunteer at the church a couple of times a week, helping with the flower arrangements. That’s nice. Keeps me busy. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. A quiet life, regular walks, volunteering and cooking – that all sounds very good for you. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Except maybe… I once had a bad experience with some shellfish, years ago. I got a little…upset, let’s just say. But that was decades ago, and I haven’t had shellfish since, so it doesn’t really count, does it? I don't recall any allergies to medications. The doctors never asked me, and I never thought to mention it. I just take what they give me. I don’t bother them with unnecessary questions. Is that bad? I really don’t like making a fuss.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad at all, Ms. Calvery. It's good you haven’t had any reactions, and it sounds like you're careful. The shellfish incident is good to know, though. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't really like doctors poking around, but I suppose I should cooperate. Just be gentle, please? I'm a little sensitive. And don't be alarmed if I flinch. I've never been very good with needles either. My husband used to get all the shots. I always turned away. Is that silly? I just...don’t like pain. But go ahead, Doctor. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I'll be as gentle as possible. And no needles just yet - we'll start with the basics. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright, just breathe normally. I'm getting a reading of 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, if you could open your mouth for me… Throat looks fine, and ears are clear. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now. Just lie back and relax. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but that slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur warrant further investigation. I think we should order some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function and a complete blood count. I'd also like to get an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work and an EKG? That sounds… complicated. Are you sure it’s necessary, Doctor? I told you, I feel perfectly fine. I’ve lived a long life without all these tests. Is it going to be painful? And expensive? My friend, Eun-hae, she always complains about the bills. I’m on Medicare, you know. They don’t cover everything. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Maybe I should just go home and have a nice cup of tea. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age, like I said. Perhaps just a little rest is all I need. But… if you really think it’s necessary… I suppose I can do the blood work. But I’m not keen on the EKG. What exactly does it involve? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Calvery. It does sound like a lot, and I don't want to cause you any unnecessary stress. The blood work is fairly straightforward – just a simple draw, and it will give us a good baseline. The EKG is painless, I assure you. It involves placing a few small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. It doesn’t involve any needles, and it only takes a few minutes. The slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur don't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's important to rule out any potential heart issues. It's better to be safe than sorry, especially given your husband's history. Medicare should cover both tests, but we’ll verify that with the billing department before proceeding. If it would ease your mind, we can start with just the blood work and see what the results show. If anything concerning comes up, then we can discuss the EKG further. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just the blood work then. That I can manage. As long as there aren't too many needles. And promise me you’ll explain the results to me in plain English, Doctor. None of that medical jargon. I don’t understand any of it. And if it turns out to be something serious… well, I don’t even want to think about it. But… if it’s just a little cholesterol, maybe I can try some of those oatmeal cookies Eun-hae keeps telling me about. She says they’re very healthy. But honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit lightheaded. Maybe I should sit down for a bit before you draw the blood. Is there a waiting room? I think I need a nice cup of tea. And a biscuit. A small biscuit, just to steady my nerves. But definitely no shellfish. I still get a little queasy just thinking about it. And please, no surprises, Doctor. I don't do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We'll do just the blood work for now, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. No medical jargon, I assure you. And I'll make sure you're comfortable before we proceed. Here, let me help you into this chair. We have tea and biscuits in the waiting room, and I’ll have a nurse bring you a cup and a biscuit right away. Nurse, could you please bring Ms. Calvery a cup of tea and a biscuit?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. You’re a much more patient man than I expected. And a biscuit…that does sound lovely. Just a small one, though. I’m trying to watch my weight, you know. Old age… it does things to your metabolism. I used to be able to eat anything without gaining an ounce. But those were different times. Times were simpler then. No blood work, no EKGs, just good food and good company. But I suppose things change. Everything changes. Well… let’s get this over with then. As long as there's tea and a biscuit involved, I suppose I can face a few needles. But gently, please. Very gently. And tell me, Doctor… what exactly are we looking for in the blood work? Just so I know what to expect. And… is it going to hurt? Really hurt? .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I’ll make sure everything is as gentle as possible. It’s a quick draw, and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. A little pinch, that’s all. We’re checking your cholesterol levels – that includes LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. High LDL cholesterol can increase your risk of heart disease, while HDL is considered “good” cholesterol. We’re also checking your kidney function and a complete blood count to get a general picture of your health. But let's not worry about the details right now. We'll discuss the results thoroughly once they're available. And please, just focus on your tea and biscuit for now. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood.
