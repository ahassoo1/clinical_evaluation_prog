DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic, so you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too. It’s this nausea, see? Happens most mornings now. It's a bit unsettling, and Dr. MacIntyre – bless her soul – she wanted me to get it checked out, given my heart’s been a bit… fragile, shall we say. It just comes on, usually before I’ve even had a proper cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Dr. MacIntyre, right. Yes, I see she referred you. "Fragile heart"… Okay. So, this nausea – it’s only in the mornings?
PATIENT: Aye, mostly. Though, it was a bit worse last Tuesday after I helped old Mrs. Abernathy with her groceries. Bit of a strain, that was. But generally, it’s right when I wake up, before I’ve even gotten out of bed. Doesn't last long, mind you, just… unpleasant. And it’s been happening for, oh, about three weeks now, maybe a bit longer. Can’t quite put my finger on it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said it doesn't last long?
PATIENT: No, not long at all. Ten, fifteen minutes maybe? It's not like I'm sick all day, thankfully. More of a… queasy feeling, a bit like seasickness, but milder. I can usually force a bit of toast down after, and I’m right as rain. But it’s worrying, you know? My heart isn't what it used to be, and I don't fancy adding sickness to the mix.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Now… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, but that could just be my age, eh? And my ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day, but that's been happening for ages, too. Nothing new, I don't think. Oh! And I’ve been a bit short of breath when I walk up the hill to the shops. But then, that hill is a monster. It's hard to say what's normal these days. I'm sorry, I'm rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. The swelling – how long have you had that, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, years. Decades, maybe. It comes and goes, you see. Worse in the summer, naturally. If I put my feet up for a bit, it goes down. I didn't think much of it, to be honest. It’s just… part of getting old, I always figured. It’s not painful, if that makes any difference. Just… puffy. A bit embarrassing, but mostly just annoying.
DOCTOR: And the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s only when I’m walking uphill, like I said. Not walking slowly uphill, mind you. A proper brisk walk. I have to stop and catch my breath a bit, but it doesn’t last long, either. It's happened maybe… three times in the last month? It's not a wheezing sort of breathlessness, more of a… puffing sort. I used to be able to walk up that hill without a second thought, but that was a few years back. I'm probably just getting out of shape.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any chest pain, dizziness, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Chest pain, no. Not at all. Dizziness… occasionally, but that's usually when I stand up too quickly, and I’ve always been a bit prone to that. Bowel habits… no changes there, thankfully. Regular as clockwork, you might say. Sorry to be so detailed! I try to be thorough. It’s just… with my heart, I worry about everything. Dr. MacIntyre keeps a good eye on me, but she’s busy, you know? I didn’t want to bother her with what might be nothing.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a listen. Pulse is a little irregular… not alarming, but we’ll keep an eye on it. I'm going to check your ankles too. Yes, some edema here. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Let me think… I take Digoxin, Dr. MacIntyre prescribed that for the heart, of course. And Ramipril, for the blood pressure. And a little Aspirin, every day, she said it helps with the blood. Oh, and sometimes I take a bit of Paracetamol for my arthritis, when it’s playing up. That’s about it, I think. I have the list at home, but I can usually remember. I'm quite good with remembering things, usually. Well, most things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to be a bit cautious with things, but I’ve never had any trouble. Dr. MacIntyre checked when she started me on the Digoxin, and everything was clear then. I’m quite careful about what I take, to be honest. I don’t like messing with things unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke or drink alcohol, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched it in my life. My father smoked, you see, and it wasn't a pretty sight. And I used to enjoy a wee dram now and then, a glass of whisky, but I gave that up a few years ago. Dr. MacIntyre said it might interfere with the medication. So, no, I don’t smoke or drink. I try to look after myself, you see. Best I can, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history of heart problems and the recent nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. It could be related to the Digoxin – sometimes it can cause nausea and fatigue as a side effect. However, given your age and existing conditions, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a blood test to check your Digoxin levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying issues. And I’d like you to have an ECG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Oh, right. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests and an ECG, aye? I'm not fond of needles, but if it’ll put my mind at ease, I'll do it. Kidney function… I haven't had that checked in a while. I suppose it's important, given everything. And the heart rhythm… well, that’s always a worry, isn’t it? Whenever I feel a flutter, I get a bit anxious. When can I have these tests done? And will I need an appointment? I'm quite flexible, thankfully. I don’t have much on.
DOCTOR: I'll have the nurse arrange the blood test and ECG for you today. She'll give you the appointment details. I want to see you back here in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness… straight to the emergency room. Right. And a week to discuss the results. Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. It’s reassuring to know someone is keeping an eye on things. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I’ll let the nurse know I’m ready when she’s free. Thank you again.
