DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, bladder pressure. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… difficult to explain precisely. It feels like I need to go to the bathroom constantly, even when I don’t really need to. And sometimes, when I do need to go, it’s hard to… completely empty my bladder, if that makes sense. It’s not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable and a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and thank you for explaining that so clearly. So, a frequent urge to urinate, even when you don't feel fully emptied. Has this been a sudden change, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: It’s been gradual, definitely. I think it started… maybe a month or so ago? At first, it wasn’t too bad, just needing to go a little more often. But over the past week or so, it’s gotten noticeably worse. It's starting to interfere with things, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, gradual onset, worsening over the past week, and now it’s interfering with your daily activities. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the bladder pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No burning or pain while I urinate, thankfully. No fever or chills. Sometimes, just sometimes, I feel a little bit of discomfort in my lower abdomen, but it’s very mild and comes and goes. Oh! And I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, but I wasn't sure if that was related.
DOCTOR: Alright, no burning or pain with urination, no fever, mild intermittent lower abdominal discomfort, and some increased fatigue. That's helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve seen. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any blood or anything unusual like that. It looks… pretty standard, I suppose. I check, naturally, when I’m noticing these issues.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m generally very healthy. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. My doctor checks it annually, and everything is always fine. I have Medicare, so they're pretty thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned Medicare, so regular checkups. Do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many things if I can. I prefer natural remedies when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky, thankfully. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been able to manage things at home. I'm married, and my husband is very supportive. He helps me stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, type 2, but she managed it with diet and exercise. My father had high blood pressure, like me, but otherwise, no major health issues on either side of the family that I’m aware of. Nothing related to the bladder or kidneys, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Let's talk about your social history briefly. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And no, I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet evening at home with my husband, honestly. We enjoy gardening.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, very minimal alcohol use. Now, one last thing regarding allergies - do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. We don't have any pets, so I haven't been exposed to much in that regard either. I'm very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for providing all of that information, Marialena. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and I'll need to do a quick neurological check, and a pelvic exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand that's necessary. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen sounds normal, no obvious signs of distension or tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please cross your legs and relax your legs?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. Just let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Good reflexes there, nice and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to proceed with the pelvic exam. I will explain everything as I go, and please let me know if you feel any discomfort. It’s important to assess your bladder and pelvic muscles. I'll be using a speculum and taking a sample for a urine analysis. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Please explain everything as you go, and I will definitely let you know if I feel any discomfort. I appreciate you being thorough and explaining each step.
DOCTOR: Okay, the pelvic exam didn’t reveal any obvious abnormalities. Your pelvic muscles appear normal in tone. I've collected a urine sample for analysis, which will help us rule out infection or other issues. I will have the results back shortly. While we wait, can you describe the sensation of needing to urinate?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t as bad as I anticipated. As for the sensation… it’s a sudden urge, very insistent. It feels like I have to go right now, even if I just went a few minutes ago. And sometimes, it’s a false alarm. I go to the bathroom, and very little comes out. It’s… frustrating, and a little embarrassing, honestly. It’s constantly on my mind, wondering if I need to go or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sudden, insistent urge, sometimes a false alarm, and it's causing you some anxiety. That's very helpful information. Based on your history and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something as simple as an overactive bladder, or it could be related to a urinary tract infection, even though you don’t have any burning or pain. It’s also possible, though less likely, that there could be some mild bladder irritation. The urine analysis will be very important. I’m also going to check your blood pressure again, just to confirm it's well-controlled. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. While we wait for the results, have you noticed any lower back pain?
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining the possibilities. No, I haven’t noticed any lower back pain at all, thankfully. Just the slight discomfort in my lower abdomen, very mild and intermittent, as I mentioned earlier. It's not constant, and doesn’t really interfere with anything. I'm just hoping we can figure out what's causing this. It’s really disrupting my daily life.
DOCTOR: I understand, and we will do our best to find out what’s going on. Okay, the urine analysis came back clear – no signs of infection. That’s good news. However, there is a slightly elevated level of protein in your urine. It’s not drastically high, but it’s enough to warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms and the lab results, I suspect you may be experiencing an overactive bladder, potentially with some mild bladder irritation. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a bladder scan to assess how much urine is left after you void, and a post-void residual volume test. This will help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. A bladder scan and the residual volume test… yes, please. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I trust your judgement. What exactly will those tests involve?
DOCTOR: Great. The bladder scan is non-invasive. It uses sound waves to measure the amount of urine in your bladder before and after you urinate. It’s painless and takes just a few minutes. The post-void residual volume test is also simple. After you urinate, we'll use a small catheter to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It may cause a slight, temporary discomfort, but it's generally well-tolerated. We’ll schedule those tests for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and keeping a bladder diary – noting how often you urinate, how much you drink, and any triggers that worsen your symptoms. Would you like me to provide you with a written instruction sheet for the bladder diary?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A written instruction sheet for the bladder diary would be very helpful. That sounds like a good way to track everything. And thank you for explaining the tests so clearly. I feel much more comfortable knowing what to expect. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. Besides keeping the bladder diary and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, there's not much else you need to do right now. We’ll review the results of the tests tomorrow and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild urinary analgesic to help manage any discomfort you may experience while we wait for the results. Here's the instruction sheet for the bladder diary and the prescription. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Everything is very clear, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Thank you for your patience and kindness. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. I’ll see you tomorrow morning then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. I'll see you tomorrow morning as well. If anything changes or you have any concerns before then, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good rest of your day, Marialena.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything.
