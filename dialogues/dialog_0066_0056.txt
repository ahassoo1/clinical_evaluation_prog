DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to see you. I’m Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Condray, is it? Yes, well. It’s… a long story. A rather tedious one, actually. To put it simply, the young people. They simply don't respect the sanctity of knowledge anymore. It’s… stressful. I’ve been a teacher for a very long time, you see. A very long time. And things… have deteriorated.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, Erle. It’s admirable that you’ve dedicated so much time to teaching. But let's focus on you for a moment. Has this stress been causing you any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Oh, don't bother with all that. A bit of tiredness, perhaps. Old age, you know. It’s not like I’m ill. It’s just… irritating. It’s a matter of principle, really. My stomach perhaps feels a little… unsettled. But honestly, Doctor, I haven’t much time for ailments. Can we simply acknowledge the problem and be done with it?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Erle. Even small changes can be important. When you say “unsettled,” can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s… a sort of queasiness, I suppose. Mostly in the mornings. And… a lack of appetite. Not that I require much these days. It’s all rather unpleasant, but I assure you, Doctor, it’s not life-threatening. It’s simply a consequence of dealing with… inferior minds.
DOCTOR: Okay, queasiness mostly in the mornings and a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my sleep has been… fragmented. I wake up often, usually with thoughts about… well, about the state of education, naturally. And I’ve been… short-tempered, I suppose. My ex-wife would love to hear that, I’m sure. But honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I have a great deal to do.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Erle. Fragmented sleep and increased irritability alongside the queasiness and appetite loss. These things can all be connected. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Good heavens, no. I haven't been weighing myself. I’m a man of principles, not vanity. I likely haven’t gained much, certainly not lost any. I eat… adequately. Though not with the same gusto as before, naturally. This is all rather… trivial, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. And how have your bowel movements been lately?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you attempting to pry into my personal life? Really! That is… quite inappropriate. I fail to see how my… digestive functions are relevant to my… professional frustrations. This is precisely why I dislike doctors. Asking all sorts of impertinent questions. I believe I’ve said enough.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question felt intrusive, Erle. I assure you, it’s not meant to be personal. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes offer clues to what’s going on, especially with symptoms like queasiness and appetite loss. It helps me rule out different possibilities. But if you're uncomfortable discussing it, we can certainly move on. Perhaps we can talk about your medical history then?
PATIENT: Very well. My medical history… it's rather uneventful, actually. I had the measles as a child, I believe. And a rather nasty bout of influenza in… 1968, perhaps? Beyond that, I've always been a remarkably healthy individual. I maintain a strict regimen, you see. Intellectual pursuits, you understand. Keeps the body… functioning. I refuse to waste any more of your time with trivialities. Let's just say it's stress, and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles as a child and influenza in 1968. No hospitalizations or surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never been one for hospitals. Dreadful places, filled with… unpleasantness. And surgeries? Good heavens, no. I take excellent care of myself. A healthy mind in a healthy body, you understand. I've always prided myself on my self-sufficiency. Really, Doctor, are we quite finished? I have a library to oversee, you know. And frankly, this conversation is becoming rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, Erle, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. My father was a… stern man. He had a touch of gout, I believe. And my mother… well, she was rather frail. She succumbed to… old age, eventually. Beyond that, I honestly haven’t the slightest idea. We weren’t a particularly close-knit family. Always very… independent. I assure you, Doctor, there’s nothing of medical significance to be gleaned from my lineage.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not. I refuse to poison my body with those… concoctions. I rely on my intellect, you see. A sound mind requires no artificial stimulants or… suppressants. And allergies? I have a mild aversion to dust, perhaps. But hardly a medical condition. Really, Doctor, are we quite finished yet? This is proving to be a most unproductive consultation.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, no known allergies. Finally, do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you attempting to ascertain my moral character now? Really! I am a retired educator, a man of principles! I abstain from all such… vulgar habits. A clear mind requires sobriety, you see. I partake of the occasional glass of red wine with dinner, perhaps. For its… historical significance. But hardly to excess. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. Thank you for answering my questions. Based on what you’ve told me – the queasiness, decreased appetite, fragmented sleep, irritability, and lack of significant medical history – it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause without further investigation. However, given your age and the recent onset of these symptoms, and the fact that you are not taking any medication, several possibilities come to mind. It could be related to stress, as you suspect, but it’s also important to rule out other causes. I'm concerned about the potential for a mild infection, or even early signs of gastrointestinal issues. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of your overall health. We should also consider a stool test to check for any underlying infections or inflammation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Stool tests? Really, Doctor? This is becoming quite absurd. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. This is simply a consequence of dealing with… the younger generation. I refuse to subject myself to such… indignities. I came here for a diagnosis, not a battery of unnecessary examinations. Honestly, Doctor, I believe I’ve wasted enough of my time. I’ll take my chances. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider if your symptoms worsen or persist. Please don't hesitate to return if you experience any changes, such as fever, abdominal pain, or significant weight loss. I will document our conversation and your refusal of testing. I wish you the best and hope your stress improves. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
