DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. I'm just… tired. Really tired. And it's not just regular tired, you know? It's… different. And I’ve been eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don't look at me like that. It sounds awful, I know, but I just… crave it. Clay, mostly. It helps, a little. But I’m getting weaker, and it’s worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand you’re feeling very tired, and that’s concerning, especially with the added detail about craving and consuming clay. It’s good you’re telling me everything, and I absolutely won’t judge. It takes courage to share things like that. Let’s unpack this a bit. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Courage? It's just… a thing that's happening. And it's not like I enjoy eating dirt! It started… well, a few months ago, I suppose. Maybe around March? It was gradual, at first. Just feeling a bit more worn out than usual. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. I used to be able to do everything, you know? Now… getting up the stairs is a chore. And the craving… that started a bit after the tiredness really set in. Honestly, I don't even know why I started. It just… felt right. Does that even make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Candis. Sometimes our bodies do strange things, and it’s my job to figure out why. So, March… that’s about five months ago. And you said it’s been steadily worsening. Can you describe the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me. Of course it makes sense to you, that’s what you’re paid for. It’s not just sleepy tiredness, if that makes any difference. It’s… heavy. Like someone is weighing me down. And it's not helped by the constant feeling of being cold, even when it's warm. Like my bones are chilled. I have no energy, no motivation… just… nothing. It's… debilitating, honestly. I used to be so active, always doing something. Now, I mostly just sit. And eat dirt, apparently. Are we going to get anywhere with this, or are we just going to sit here and talk about how tired I am?
DOCTOR: You're right to want to get to the bottom of this, Candis, and I apologize if I came across as dismissive. It’s frustrating when you don’t have answers, and I want to assure you I’m taking this seriously. “Heavy” and feeling chilled even when warm – those are important details. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Honestly, not really. I eat when I remember to, I suppose. It's not like I'm hungry. Food just… doesn’t appeal to me much anymore. It all tastes kind of… bland. And I’ve lost some weight, I think. My clothes are a bit looser. Though, maybe that’s just because I’m tired all the time and don't feel like doing much. It’s hard to say. I really just want to know what’s wrong with me. Is it something serious? You’re a doctor, you should know these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Loss of appetite and weight loss, along with the tiredness, feeling chilled, and the clay cravings – we’re building a picture here. It's good you're telling me everything. Now, this might be a bit personal, but have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Ugh. Really? Do you have to ask about everything? Honestly, it’s just… embarrassing. But fine. Yes, things haven’t been… regular. More…constipated, I suppose. And… sometimes there’s blood. A little. It’s not a lot, but it’s there. Look, I’m not a delicate flower, I understand things can go wrong with age, but this whole thing is unsettling. I just want a simple answer. Is it something I can fix, or is this just… it?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Candis. It’s important information, even if it’s uncomfortable to talk about. The constipation and the presence of blood are definitely things we need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had the flu, badly, back in… oh, I don’t know, the nineties? And a bad knee, needed a replacement years ago. But nothing… serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. A little arthritis, you know, what you’d expect. And I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Not since the knee. I don't bother them unless something is really wrong. Which, apparently, it is now. Are you writing all this down? I hope so, because I don't want to have to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, I am writing everything down. I have excellent recall, but it’s important to document everything for accuracy. Flu in the nineties, knee replacement, and some arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than the knee replacement?
PATIENT: No, just the knee. And honestly, that was a disaster. Took forever to recover, and it still bothers me sometimes. Look, I’m not a fan of doctors or hospitals, if that’s not obvious. I prefer to just… deal with things myself. Which is why I let this go on for so long. I just hoped it would… go away. But it didn’t. So here I am. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about my medical history forever? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Candis, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We are getting somewhere. Your history helps me narrow down the possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that's a mess. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died young. And my father… he was always sickly. Lots of colds and coughs. My brother… he had cancer, a long time ago. But honestly, nobody really talked about these things. We weren't a close family. So I don't know much detail. It’s just… a lot of sickness, I guess. Look, I'm not a medical historian, I just want to know what's wrong with me. Can we please get to that? I’m starting to feel faint just thinking about all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. It's okay that you don't have a detailed family history. We'll work with what we have. A history of heart problems and cancer in the family is worth noting. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never have, never will. Disgusting habits, both of them. I take care of myself, or at least I try to. I eat healthy, I get enough sleep when I can, I try to stay active… well, I used to stay active. I’m a very particular person. I don’t need vices. Look, I'm getting quite lightheaded now. This whole thing is exhausting. Are we nearly done? I really need to sit down. And maybe have a lie down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No smoking or alcohol, and you prioritize your health. That’s good to know. Now, one last question about your social history – do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. Always have, always will. Never married, no children. It's just me. And honestly, I prefer it that way. Less drama, less trouble. I have a few acquaintances, but nobody close. I manage perfectly well on my own. Look, I’m really not feeling well. I think I'm going to faint. Can we please just get to the testing now? Or whatever it is you need to do to figure out what’s wrong with me? I'm starting to see spots.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. You live alone, and prefer it that way. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, chills, weight loss, constipation with blood, and the clay cravings – and your history, I’m concerned about several possibilities. These symptoms, taken together, are concerning enough that we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, iron studies, and kidney and liver function tests. I also want to check your thyroid levels. And given the blood in your stool, I’m going to order a stool test to check for infection and blood. Would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam now?
PATIENT: A brief physical exam? Honestly, I don’t see the point, but fine. Get it over with. Just… be gentle. And don’t take all day. I really need to lie down. I’m starting to feel very weak. And please, explain everything clearly. I don’t want any medical jargon. I just want to know what’s wrong with me. And I don't want to wait weeks for the results. I need to know now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand your urgency and I’ll do my best to be quick and clear. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart rate is a little slow, but otherwise sounds normal. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: Abdomen? Ugh. Yes, it’s tender. Especially… here, on the left side. It’s a dull ache, not sharp, but it's definitely there. And it's been getting worse lately. It feels… bloated, too. Like I'm full of air. Honestly, I don’t like being poked and prodded. Can we please just get the tests done now? This is making me anxious. And I feel even weaker than before. Are you sure you’re not missing something obvious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Tenderness in the left abdomen, a dull ache, and a feeling of bloating. That’s important information. Now, I’m going to check for any swelling in your legs. And I'm noting that your skin looks a little pale. Given all of your symptoms – the fatigue, chills, weight loss, constipation with blood, clay cravings, abdominal tenderness, bloating, pallor, and slow heart rate – I'm concerned about the possibility of iron deficiency anemia. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as colon cancer or an infection. That’s why the blood work and stool test are so important. I'm going to write the orders for those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to draw the blood right away. The stool test kit will be easy to use, and I’ll give you instructions on how to collect the sample. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Anemia? Is that… serious? Colon cancer? Oh, goodness. I knew I shouldn’t have come here. This is awful. Look, I don’t want to know about colon cancer. Just… tell me what I need to do to get these tests done. And how long they’ll take. And whether they’ll make me feel even worse. Honestly, I just want this whole thing to be over with. And I want to know if it’s fixable. Can you at least tell me that? Is there anything I can do right now to feel better? I feel like I’m going to pass out. Please just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Let’s take things one step at a time. Anemia can be serious, but it’s often treatable. It means you have a lower than normal number of red blood cells, and that can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. We need to find out why you’re anemic before we can determine the best course of treatment. As for colon cancer, I mentioned it only because it’s a possibility we need to rule out, given the blood in your stool. It doesn’t mean you have it, just that we need to investigate. The blood work will take about an hour to process, and the stool test will take a few days to get back. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible. Stay hydrated. And try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t have much appetite. I’m also going to prescribe you an iron supplement to start taking right away. It can help alleviate some of the symptoms of anemia, but it’s important to remember that it won’t address the underlying cause. Is there anyone you'd like me to call to come sit with you while we wait for the blood work results?
PATIENT: Iron supplement? Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. No, don’t bother calling anyone. I’m perfectly capable of sitting here alone. I always am. Honestly, I just want to lie down. Is there a quiet room where I can rest while we wait? This is… exhausting. And I feel awful. And I’m starting to get a headache. Please, just tell me where the quiet room is. And don’t make me repeat myself. I really don’t have the energy. And I need a blanket. I’m cold. Always cold. This is ridiculous. I should have just stayed home.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right. You should be resting. Maria, could you please show Candis to the quiet room and bring her a blanket?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Of course. Maria will take good care of you. I’ll be here when the results come back, and we’ll discuss them as soon as they’re available. Try not to worry too much, Candis. We’re going to figure this out. .
