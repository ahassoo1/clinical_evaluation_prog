DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need a... a permission slip. For somethin' the young lady at the beauty shop told me I needed. Somethin' 'bout gettin' work done. My face, you see. Needs a little... fixin'. Don't know what it's called. She said I gotta see a doctor first.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. It sounds like you need a medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure. We want to ensure you are healthy enough for any treatment and to rule out any contraindications. To start, could you tell me a little more about what procedure the young lady at the beauty shop mentioned?
PATIENT: A... contra... what now? Look, I don’t do fancy words. She said somethin' 'bout liftin'. Liftin' the skin on my face. I’m gettin’ wrinkles, you see? And it… sags. That’s what she said. A “face lift,” I think she called it. I don’t rightly remember all the details. It’s been a while, and honestly, I wasn't payin' that much attention. Just want it done quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a face lift. That’s helpful to know. And you're right, we want to get this sorted out as efficiently as possible. Just to be thorough – and to make sure we cover everything – could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My health? Well… I mostly keep to myself. Used to climb towers, puttin' up antennas and such. Radio stuff, cellular, all that. Hard work, it was. Been retired for… oh, goodness. Ten years, maybe? More? My bones ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. I eat… when I remember. Don’t bother with fancy diets or nothin’. And I mostly drink water. That’s about it. Never been much for doctors, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of physically demanding work, and you've been retired for about ten years. That's good information. Are you currently experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my knees ache somethin' fierce in the cold weather. And my back… sometimes it twinges. Old injuries, you see? From the towers. And I get… winded easy. Walkin' up the stairs is a chore these days. But that’s just… gettin’ old, I reckon. Nothin’ to worry about. Is this holdin' up the process? I’ve got errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not holding anything up at all, Mr. Honcoop. It's important for me to understand these things so we can make the best decision regarding your clearance for the procedure. The knee and back pain, and getting winded easily – those are all things we need to consider. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like arthritis, heart problems, or high blood pressure – by a doctor in the past?
PATIENT: Arthritis… maybe? The lady at the pharmacy keeps askin' if I need somethin' for it. I told her no. Heart problems… don’t think so. I had a little… flutterin’ in my chest once, but it went away. High… what was it? Blood pressure? I don’t know. Never had it checked. I told you, I don’t bother with doctors. Makes me nervous. Is this a trick question?
DOCTOR: No, not a trick question at all, Mr. Honcoop. It's just important to have a complete picture of your health history. It sounds like you haven't had a recent medical check-up. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm… Let me think. No, not that I know of. I don’t take nothin’. Never really needed to. Maybe a little… snifflin' when the pollen's bad, but that's just the season changin'. That ain't an allergy, is it? Look, I’m gettin’ a headache. This is takin’ too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I apologize if this feels lengthy. We just want to ensure your safety. No major medication allergies, that’s good. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – has had any significant medical problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Now there's a question. My mama… she died young. Somethin’ with her heart, I think. But I was just a boy. And my daddy… he worked hard his whole life. Never took a day off, even when he was sick. I don’t recall him bein’ sick with nothin’ in particular. My sister… she moved away. Haven’t seen her in decades. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to other people’s problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of heart problems, and no significant known illnesses in your father or sister. That’s helpful. Just a few more questions, then we can do a brief physical exam. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. My daddy always said it was a waste of good money. And it smelled awful. I don't like things that smell awful. Can we get this over with soon? I’ve got a fish to fry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Honcoop. We're almost finished with the questions. One last thing. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little bit. On special occasions. Christmas, maybe. Or New Year’s. A glass of wine with dinner. That's about it. Nothing fancy. Certainly not enough to cause any trouble. Look, are you gonna poke me with needles? 'Cause I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Mr. Honcoop. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a check of your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But no pokin'. You hear? No pokin'. This better be quick. I’m startin’ to feel faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. And I do hear a slight murmur when I listen to your heart. It’s faint, but it's something we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, though. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I’m concerned about your overall cardiovascular health. Before I can provide clearance for a face lift, I need to order some tests. An EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm, and a basic blood panel to check your kidney function and cholesterol levels.
PATIENT: Tests? More tests?! Look, I knew I shouldn’t have come here. This is ridiculous. I just want a little lift, not a whole medical workup. Can't I just… sign somethin' sayin' I take responsibility? I’m a grown man! I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. However, as your physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. A face lift, like any medical procedure, carries risks. It's crucial we identify any underlying health conditions that could increase those risks. Signing a waiver doesn’t negate the potential for complications if an undiagnosed condition exists. I am legally and ethically obligated to perform a reasonable assessment before proceeding with any treatment. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your cardiovascular health. If everything checks out, we can proceed. If there are concerns, we can discuss alternative options or refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Look, I don't want to hear about no cardiologists or evaluations! Just… forget it. Forget the whole thing. I don’t need a face lift bad enough to go through all this trouble. Waste of time, waste of money. I’m leavin'. Just give me back my insurance card… oh wait. I don’t have an insurance card. Never mind.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your decision. However, before you leave, I strongly recommend scheduling a general check-up with a primary care physician to address your elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur. It’s important to monitor these conditions, regardless of the face lift. I can provide you with a list of local physicians who accept patients without insurance. Here’s some information on affordable healthcare options. Please take care of yourself. .
