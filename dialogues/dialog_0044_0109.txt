DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s… my head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like… a tight band. Not a bad pain, just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight band sensation at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Three days… I was working, you see. Out at the rail yard. Moving cars… with the little engine. Dinkey, they call it. It started… after a long shift. Hot day, very hot. I was tired, maybe that’s it. I went home, and later that night… the pain started. Just a little bit, at first. I thought it was just from being tired. But it didn’t go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began after a long, hot shift at the rail yard, moving cars with the "dinkey", and it started that evening. That's helpful. Does anything make the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Well… lying down seems to help. When I rest. And… cool cloth on my forehead, sometimes. Makes it… less. Worse… hmm. Being tired makes it worse, definitely. And… if I bend over too fast, it gets a little sharp. Not a lot, but… yeah. Sharp for a moment.
DOCTOR: Okay, so rest and a cool cloth help, and fatigue and bending over seem to aggravate it. That gives us a better picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. No… no fever. I don't think so. No dizziness. My vision is… okay. Everything looks normal. No blurry spots or anything. I haven't felt sick to my stomach. Just… the headache. And… maybe a little bit more tired than usual. But I am 90 years old, Doctor. So, maybe that's just… old age.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Brum. It's important to consider everything. No fever, no dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea. Just the headache and a little extra fatigue. Have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I’ve had headaches, sure. A little bit from the sun sometimes, working outside. But this… this is different. This is more… steady. And at the back of my head. The others were more… all over. And they went away with a little rest and some water. This one… lingers. Even when I rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a key distinction – this is different from your usual headaches, more persistent and located specifically at the back of your head. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I used to have… high blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor, he said it was okay now. Just watch the salt, he told me. And my knees… they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, I think. But that’s it. Nothing serious. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Worked hard my whole life. Never had much time for being sick.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. High blood pressure in the past, currently managed with watching your salt intake, and some arthritis in your knees. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills. Not even aspirin. I don't like taking medicine if I don't have to. I just… try to take it easy when my knees hurt. Maybe a little rub-on stuff sometimes. But that’s it. No regular pills. Never been much of a pill-taker.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And you mentioned working at the rail yard. Are you still working there now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Still working. Not full time, mind you. Just a few days a week. I like to stay busy. Keeps me moving. I've been working there… oh, for almost 60 years now. Started when I was a young man. I know the yard like the back of my hand. They need someone who knows the equipment. And… well, it keeps me going. But maybe… maybe it’s too much for an old man. I don't know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s admirable that you’re staying active, and it’s good you recognize it might be becoming strenuous. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I'm going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to feel around the back of your head and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. Blood pressure is good? I haven't had it checked in a while. And my heart… it's still ticking, I guess. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart and lungs sound good, and I do feel some tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull. It doesn’t seem to be anything major, but it could be contributing to your headache. Given your age, and the fact that this headache is different from what you’ve experienced before, I’d like to be cautious. I’m thinking this could be a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain from work, but to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to get a simple blood test to check your electrolytes and inflammatory markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Hmm. I don't like needles, Doctor. But… if you think it’s important. I trust you. If it will make sure everything is okay… yes, okay. Do the blood test. But… can you be quick about it? I don't want to be here all day. And… try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I understand your reluctance, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. It will just be a standard blood draw, and the lab technician is very skilled. It will take only a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and recommend some over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen, to help manage the headache in the meantime. Also, I’d like you to avoid strenuous activity, especially at work, until we have the blood test results back. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… muscle relaxant and ibuprofen. And no hard work. That… that’s going to be hard. But I’ll try. I don't want to be poking around at the rail yard with a bad headache. So, yes. That sounds reasonable. How long will the blood test take? And… do I need to do anything special before I take the pills?
DOCTOR: The blood test should take about 15-20 minutes. We'll have the results back later this afternoon, and I’ll give you a call as soon as they're available. As for the pills, the muscle relaxant can make you a little drowsy, so it’s best to take it before bed. You should take it with food, and avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. The ibuprofen can be taken with food as well, and you shouldn't exceed the recommended dosage on the bottle. I'll write down all the instructions for you, just to be sure. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never had any trouble with pills before. Just don't like taking them if I don't need to. You said no driving? But I need to get home! I live a little ways out of town.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Mr. Brum. My apologies, I should have clarified. I meant avoid driving until you know how the muscle relaxant affects you. It doesn’t affect everyone the same way, and some people experience drowsiness. If you feel alert and clear-headed after taking it, you should be fine to drive. But if you feel sleepy or dizzy, please ask someone else to drive you home. I’ll make a note of that on the instructions. Now, let me write up these prescriptions for you, and we can go over the instructions together. While I do that, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… hoping it’s nothing serious. I don't want to have to stop working. It keeps me going, you see. It keeps me… alive. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I completely understand how important staying active is, and that’s why we’re taking these precautions. We'll get these tests done, and hopefully, it’s just a muscle strain. Here you are. This prescription is for the muscle relaxant, and this sheet has all the instructions for both medications, as well as a reminder to avoid strenuous activity until we have the results back. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll take good care of you. I’ll call you this afternoon with the results as soon as they’re available. Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns before then. Get well soon, Mr. Brum, and please take it easy. I’ll be in touch.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
