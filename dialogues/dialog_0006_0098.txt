DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Heindel, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hey Doc. Just…curiosity, really. I ain’t sick or nothin’. Just figured I should probably check in, you know? Been a while since I saw a doctor. Thought I’d see what’s new.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Preventative care is always a good idea. It has been a while, according to the records. Just to be thorough, even though you’re not feeling ill, let’s go through some basics. Do you have any specific concerns at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Hmm…minor ones… Let me think. My back gets a little stiff sometimes after a long shift on the boat, but it usually works itself out. And… sometimes I feel a little tired, but I work really hard. Is that… something to worry about? I dunno. I mostly just figured I was gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, back stiffness after work, and some fatigue. “Getting old” isn’t usually the culprit at 25, thankfully. Let's talk about the back first. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, not that long, really. Maybe… six months? It comes and goes. Like I said, it's after a really long shift. We’re always movin’ stuff around, heavy boxes, cleanin’ the engine room… stuff like that. It’s usually gone by the next day. I just rub it and take it easy.
DOCTOR: Six months, comes and goes with activity… okay. And how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s not sharp, nothin’ like a broken bone or somethin’. More like… a real bad ache, you know? Like I pulled somethin’. It kinda goes down my back a little, but it don’t go down my legs or nothin’. Just… achy. And stiff. Real stiff.
DOCTOR: Achy and stiff, not radiating down the legs… That’s good to know. Alright. Now, you mentioned feeling tired. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It's just… I work long hours, like twelve, sometimes fourteen hours a day. It’s kinda expected on the boat. I just feel… worn out at the end of the day. More than just normal tired. I sleep okay, I think, but I just don’t feel… refreshed when I wake up. Like I didn’t really sleep at all.
DOCTOR: Twelve to fourteen hour shifts… okay. And has this fatigue been getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. It used to be I could just sleep it off, you know? But lately… it takes longer and longer to recover. And I find myself just… draggin’ through the day. It's kinda affectin’ my work, I guess. I’m makin’ more mistakes. Not big ones, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s definitely something we need to look into. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I'm going to gently feel along your back. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay... some mild tenderness along the lower lumbar region, but no sharp pain. Range of motion seems mostly normal, though slightly restricted forward bending. Can you tell me about any previous injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Not that I remember. I maybe tweaked somethin’ liftin’ a heavy box a few years back, but it healed up quick. Nothing serious. Just a little sore for a couple days. I’ve always been pretty strong, so I usually just work through it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes seem normal. Muscle strength is good in both legs. Alright, let's check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 128/82. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, just to be thorough, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork. Just a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. It'll rule out a lot of things. What do you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Bloodwork sounds fine. Will that take long? I got another shift tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take long at all. We can get it done right here in the clinic. It'll take about fifteen minutes for the draw, and then the results usually come back in a couple of days. We can call you with the results or you can check online through the patient portal. While we wait for the results, I recommend trying some over-the-counter pain relief for your back – ibuprofen or naproxen should help. And try to take it easy when you can, even though I know that’s hard with your job. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nah, no allergies. I can take most stuff. Ibuprofen sounds good, I’ve used that before. I’ll try to take it easy, but you know how it is. Gotta get the job done. Okay, so fifteen minutes, and then I’ll hear from you in a couple days? That sounds good.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. Here’s the requisition for the bloodwork. The nurse will be right in to draw it. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if your back pain gets significantly worse, or you start experiencing any numbness or weakness in your legs, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Worse pain, or numb legs, I come back. Got it. Thanks, Doc. Appreciate you lookin’ at me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Heindel. It was good meeting you. Take care of yourself, and try to get some rest when you can. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: You too, Doc. Have a good one.
