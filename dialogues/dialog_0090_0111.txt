DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s…it’s a bother coming all this way. My skin, Doctor. It’s…darkening. And I tire so easily these days. Simply exhausting to even think about it, truthfully. I haven’t the time for these…ailments.
DOCTOR: Darkening skin, and fatigue… alright. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven't the faintest. Weeks, perhaps? Months? Time blurs, you understand. My wife mentioned it, naturally. She notices everything. It’s not…significant, I assure you. Just…a discoloration. And the tiredness…well, one gets old. It’s to be expected. Is there a quicker way to get this sorted? I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: "Not significant," you say. Still, it's best to investigate. And, of course, we’ll try to be efficient with your time. Now, can you describe where on your skin you’re noticing this discoloration?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Really. It’s…general. My hands, mostly. And my face, I suppose. It’s not as…vibrant as it once was. Though, frankly, I haven’t given it much thought. Is it…contagious, do you think? My grandson visits, you see, and I wouldn't want to…burden him.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like anything contagious, Mr. Drahota. But we need to figure out what it is. Have you noticed any itching, pain, or blistering with these changes?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? Certainly not. Blistering? Good heavens, no! I’m a man of steel, Doctor, not some delicate flower. It's simply… a darkening. A cosmetic issue, truly. I work with iron all day, you know. Perhaps it’s the dust? Though, I’ve been doing that for decades. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: We're trying to gather information, Mr. Drahota. While you describe it as cosmetic, changes in skin pigmentation can indicate a number of things. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Fairly consistent, I suppose. Weight? I haven’t stepped on a scale in years. Honestly, Doctor, I find these inquiries rather…personal. I’m a practical man, a builder. Not one for fussing over trivial details. My wife handles all that nonsense. Is this going to take much longer? I have a structural inspection scheduled for this afternoon. A rather important one, I might add.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Mr. Drahota. Have you noticed any unusual weakness, shortness of breath, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I feel…old. Naturally, I tire more easily. A little shortness of breath when climbing stairs, perhaps. Weakness? Well, my grip isn’t what it used to be, but that’s decades of reinforcing iron for you! Abdominal pain? No. Absolutely not. I eat my wife's cooking, it’s always…substantial. Look, is it possible this is simply…age? Can we not attribute it to that? I assure you, I’m a robust fellow, despite my years. This is wasting both our time.
DOCTOR: While age is certainly a factor, Mr. Drahota, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your reflexes. It will only take a few moments. And then, I’m going to order some basic blood work. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Blood work… Honestly. A complete waste of time and energy. Fine, Doctor. Do what you must. But I assure you, it’s likely nothing. A simple case of getting old. And don’t take too long, will you? I have commitments. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, Mr. Drahota. In…and out…Good. Your breathing sounds a little…wheezy, but not concerning at this point. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Relax, relax… Easier said than done, Doctor. I’m a man of action, not relaxation. Do hurry, please. This is…uncomfortable. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel rather faint. It’s probably the stress of this entire…ordeal.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes… Hmm. Alright, Mr. Drahota. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We also need to check your iron levels. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw some blood. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m a sturdy man, I assure you. I've never had an issue with…anything. Just get it over with, Doctor. This entire process is rather…disruptive. And make it quick, will you? I have a schedule to keep. .
