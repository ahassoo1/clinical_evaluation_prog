DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's a bit difficult to explain precisely. I believe I need some paperwork completed, regarding… future care, should something happen. Something about making sure my wishes are known. I understand it has a specific name – an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? Honestly, the details are…fuzzy. I was advised to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive… yes. A sensible, if somewhat morbid, undertaking. Though frankly, at your age… …it’s rather unusual. But, very well. We can address this. To clarify, are you requesting assistance completing these forms, or are you seeking my opinion on what should be included?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I hadn’t considered the age aspect. It simply came up in conversation with a… a friend, after a rather unsettling event. And they suggested I get it done while I still… could. I would need assistance completing the forms, yes. I’m afraid I wouldn’t know where to begin. I apologize for the vagueness. My memory… isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Very well. It seems we have a good deal of ground to cover, then. These documents require careful consideration, and a clear understanding of your wishes. Now, let's begin with the Advance Directive. It outlines your preferences for medical treatment should you become incapacitated and unable to communicate them yourself. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you taking the time. Pre-existing conditions… …that’s difficult. I have… had a few bouts of bronchitis, especially during the winters. And my knees ache, frequently. Nothing… serious, I don't think. I had a surgery on my left knee, many years ago. But I don't recall the specifics. Is that helpful? I truly apologize for being so imprecise.
DOCTOR: Bronchitis and aching knees… hardly constitutes a medical history, Ms. Buoniconti. But, very well. The knee surgery is marginally more relevant. Do you recall when this surgery occurred?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That was… a long time ago. Perhaps… twenty years ago? No, further back. Maybe twenty-five? I was living in… Ulaanbaatar at the time, I believe. It was a sports injury, actually. I used to… participate in a rather vigorous form of Mongolian wrestling. But my recollection is… fragmented. I’m afraid I can’t offer a precise date. It was before my divorce, certainly.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll note “knee surgery approximately twenty-five years ago, while residing in Ulaanbaatar”. It’s… helpful, to a degree. Now, regarding your wishes. Should you find yourself in a situation where you are unable to communicate, would you want all possible life-sustaining measures employed, regardless of prognosis?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a rather… direct question. All possible measures… regardless? That sounds… rather overwhelming. I… I suppose I’d want something done, if there was a chance. But I wouldn’t want to be kept alive indefinitely, if there was no… quality of life. I’m not certain I can articulate it properly. Is there a way to specify… a timeframe? Or perhaps, certain conditions under which treatment would be withheld?
DOCTOR: A ‘timeframe’ is… unconventional, Ms. Buoniconti. These documents are meant to be definitive, not subject to arbitrary periods. However, you can specify certain treatments you would not want, or conditions under which resuscitation would be deemed inappropriate. Do you have any particular fears or concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns… yes. I… I wouldn’t want to be kept on a machine, breathing artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. And I… I’ve always been rather afraid of being… intubated. The thought of… not being able to speak, to breathe… it’s quite terrifying. Perhaps that’s irrational, but… that’s my feeling. I also wouldn't want… prolonged feeding through a tube, if there was no prospect of improvement. Is that… understandable?
DOCTOR: We will note your aversion to intubation and prolonged artificial feeding. It’s… noted. Now, let us discuss a POLST form. This is a medical order, typically for patients with serious illnesses, outlining specific treatments you want or do not want. It differs from the Advance Directive in that it’s immediately actionable. Do you consider yourself to be in a state of serious illness?
PATIENT: No. Not at all. I… I’m reasonably healthy, all things considered. The bronchitis is seasonal, and my knees ache, as we’ve discussed. I simply wanted to be… prepared. To have my wishes known, should something unforeseen occur. Perhaps the POLST form isn’t necessary, then? I was told about both, but I'm beginning to think the Advance Directive is sufficient. Unless… you advise otherwise, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Very well. A prudent decision, Ms. Buoniconti. Given your current state of health, the Advance Directive appears to be the more appropriate document. We will focus on completing that, ensuring your wishes are clearly articulated. Now, section three pertains to your healthcare proxy. Do you have a designated individual who you would like to make medical decisions on your behalf should you become incapacitated?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… Yes. I believe… my son, Temujin. He lives in Denver. Though we haven’t spoken recently. …Our relationship is… complicated. But he is the closest relative I have. Would that be acceptable, Doctor? I haven’t formally designated him, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: A 'complicated' relationship is… less than ideal, but acceptable. We will note Temujin as your designated healthcare proxy. It would be prudent to inform him of this designation, and discuss your wishes with him directly. Do you have his contact information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It’s… rather old. I haven’t spoken to him in over a year, as I mentioned. But that is his last known address and phone number. I… I do hope he hasn’t moved. I haven't been the best at keeping in touch. It’s… a long story.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will note this information. Now, let us review the document. We have designated Temujin as your healthcare proxy, and noted your aversion to intubation and prolonged artificial feeding. Do you have any further requests or amendments at this time?
PATIENT: I believe… yes. Could it be noted that I… prefer natural pain management whenever possible? I’m not opposed to medication entirely, but I’d like to explore alternative therapies first. Things like… acupuncture, or massage. If feasible, of course. And… …I would prefer to be… surrounded by music, if I am… unable to communicate. Something calming. Mongolian folk music, perhaps. Is that… permissible? It sounds rather frivolous, I realize.
DOCTOR: We will note your preference for natural pain management and your desire for calming music – specifically, Mongolian folk music – should you become incapacitated. This document is now complete. I will print a copy for your records. Please review it carefully, and ensure it accurately reflects your wishes. Sign and date it at your convenience. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Yes, that all seems… correct. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient, despite my… vagueness. I believe that is all. I appreciate your assistance. I will certainly review this carefully, and attempt to discuss it with my son. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You are welcome. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic should you have any further questions. Next! .
