DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Morenomartinez, nice to meet you too. Well, the nurse took my blood pressure and it was kinda high, she said. That’s why I’m here, to figure out what's going on with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to check out. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it might be a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Honestly, I didn’t notice anything myself. Like I said, the nurse at the clinic told me. It was during my regular check-up last month, I think. She said it was a bit higher than usual and wanted me to come back in to get it checked again today. I don’t really feel any different, you know? No headaches or anything.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. So it was detected during a routine check-up, and you haven’t experienced any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes. That's good to know. To get a fuller picture, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or has a doctor ever mentioned it to you in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. This is totally new to me. No one’s ever said anything about my blood pressure being high before. I usually feel pretty good, all things considered. I try to eat okay and I walk sometimes... not as much as I should, maybe, but yeah. This is a surprise.
DOCTOR: Okay, a first-time finding. That helps. And you mentioned walking – how often would you say you get exercise, roughly?
PATIENT: Well, um… it depends. Some weeks I walk to the shop maybe three or four times a week, if I need groceries. But it’s not a proper workout, you know? Just walking to and from. Other weeks… not so much. I work shifts, and sometimes I’m just tired after work and just wanna relax. It’s not consistent, definitely. I wish I did more, but life gets in the way, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Shift work can definitely make it hard to stick to a routine. Let's talk a little bit about your diet. Can you describe what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. Breakfast, I usually have toast and maybe an egg, or some cereal. Sometimes just coffee, if I’m rushing. Lunch, it’s usually something quick - a sandwich or a salad if I brought it from home, but sometimes I just grab something from the canteen at work. Dinner... that varies a lot. I like to cook, but sometimes I just order takeout. I eat a lot of rice and peas, that’s for sure! And I like a good roti, but I know that's not the healthiest thing. I try to have some fruit, but I don’t always get around to it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good idea. Lots of carbs, some protein, and variable fruit intake. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Um… family history? Let me think. My mom, she had diabetes, but not high blood pressure as far as I know. My dad, he was pretty healthy, lived to be 85. I have a sister, and she's fine too, as far as I know. No one on either side really had heart problems, that I’m aware of. We don’t really talk about that stuff much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of diabetes, but no known high blood pressure. That’s helpful. And you said “as far as you know” – do you have a lot of contact with your family?
PATIENT: Not as much as I’d like, to be honest. My sister lives overseas, and I don’t see my mom very often. We talk on the phone, but we don’t really go into a lot of detail about health stuff. It’s more just, “How are you?” and things like that. It's not that we don't care, it's just... life, you know? Everyone's busy. So I don’t know a whole lot about their medical history, really. I just told you what I've heard over the years.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Okay, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, thankfully. No itchy rashes or anything like that, ever. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope, not a single one. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay away from them, if possible. Just paracetamol if I have a headache, that's about it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No regular medications. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I just want to ask a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I don’t like the smell of it, and it seems really unhealthy. My mom always told me it was terrible for you, and I listened! I don't even like being around people who smoke, honestly. It makes me cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a glass of wine sometimes, maybe on a weekend. Not very often, though. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. I don't really drink a lot. It's not a big part of my life, you know? I prefer a nice cup of tea, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, infrequent alcohol use. Last question before we do a quick exam - do you feel stressed often?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. Work is pretty stressful. It's a busy place, and the hours are long. And things can get… complicated with customers sometimes. I try not to let it get to me, but it does. I worry a lot, I guess. It’s hard to switch off sometimes. I don’t have many ways to relax, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, work-related stress. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again, just to confirm what the nurse found. Then I'll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay? I'm a bit nervous about this, to be honest, but I trust you to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now let's check your pulse… Your pulse is a little elevated, at 82. Now blood pressure… 148/92. That confirms the nurse’s reading. A bit elevated. Now, I'm just going to palpate your abdomen... Soft, no tenderness. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Everything else appears normal on initial examination. Okay, that wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That was fine. You were really gentle. 148/92… is that bad? I mean, what does that even mean? I always get confused with numbers and what they mean for my health.
DOCTOR: It's a valid question, and it’s good you asked! 148/92 is higher than we’d like. Ideally, we want your blood pressure to be around 120/80 or lower. Yours is in what we call Stage 1 hypertension. It doesn't necessarily mean you need medication right away, but it does mean we need to investigate further and see what’s causing it and how to get it under control. It can be caused by a lot of things – stress, diet, lack of exercise, genetics… sometimes there’s no obvious cause. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay… stage 1… that sounds scary. So it’s not an emergency or anything? I'm glad it's not like, really bad, but I don't want it to get worse. And you said genetics… is that why you asked about my family? And what does ‘investigate further’ even mean? Like, more tests? I don't really like tests.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not an emergency, thankfully. It’s something we can manage. Think of it like… a warning light on your car. It’s telling you something needs attention, but you don’t need to pull over immediately. And yes, that’s right. I asked about your family history because hypertension can sometimes run in families. Knowing that information can help us understand your risk. And yes, ‘investigate further’ means a few tests. Nothing too invasive, I promise. I’d like to order a blood test to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. And a urine test, just to check your kidneys as well. We’ll also do an EKG, which is a quick, painless test to check your heart rhythm. It involves sticking some patches on your chest. That will give us a better understanding of what’s going on and help us figure out the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a warning light, that makes sense. And those tests don't sound too bad, I guess. Patches on my chest… I can handle that. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know? Is there anything I can do now? Like, change my diet or something? Before I have to get all those tests done?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. No one enjoys being poked and prodded! And absolutely, there are things you can do now. Diet and lifestyle changes can make a big difference. I recommend reducing your salt intake - avoid processed foods, fast food, and adding salt to your meals. Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. And increasing your physical activity, even just a 30-minute walk most days of the week, can help lower your blood pressure. Also, focus on stress reduction techniques - things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can be helpful. We can discuss some resources for those if you’re interested. I’m going to write up a referral for those blood tests and the EKG. The nurse will schedule those for you. And I’ll print out a handout with some dietary and lifestyle recommendations. Let’s see if we can get your blood pressure down through these changes first, and then we’ll re-evaluate in a month. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a plan. A month… I can definitely try to make those changes for a month. Less salt, more walking, less stress… it's going to be hard, but I can try. And that handout would be really helpful, thank you. What if it doesn't go down after a month? Will I have to take pills then? I really don't want to take medication if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. If your blood pressure doesn’t come down after a month with lifestyle changes, we’ll discuss your options. Medication isn't always necessary, but if your blood pressure remains consistently high, it may be the best way to protect your health and prevent complications like heart disease or stroke. We would discuss the different types of medication, their potential side effects, and weigh the risks and benefits together. We’ll start with the lifestyle changes and see how you respond. Don’t put too much pressure on yourself - small changes can make a big difference. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Okay, I’m just printing out that handout now. And I'll send the referral for the blood tests and EKG to the nurse, and she’ll contact you to schedule those appointments. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Morenomartinez. You’ve explained everything really clearly, and you’ve made me feel a lot less worried. I really appreciate that. I guess I’ll just try my best with the diet and walking and see what happens.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha! I’m glad I could help. Remember, small steps, consistent effort, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care and I’ll see you in a month!
