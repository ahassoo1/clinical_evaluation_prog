DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Seil. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. More than usual, I mean. It feels like my skin is extra sensitive. It's a bit of a worry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re addressing this. Increased sun sensitivity can be a sign of several things, and it's always best to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "extra sensitive"?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… well, even on cloudy days, it feels like the sun is burning my skin. I used to be able to be out for a bit without any trouble, but now, even just walking to the store feels like too much. And it's not just redness, it's… like a prickly heat sensation sometimes, especially on my face and arms. It's hard to describe, really. It just feels… uncomfortable. I've been trying to stay covered up as much as possible, but that’s not always easy, you know?
DOCTOR: I do understand. That prickly heat sensation is helpful to know. It sounds quite bothersome. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Let me see... it started maybe... three months ago? Around the end of April, I think. It was pretty mild at first, just a little more redness than usual after being in the sun. But it’s been getting worse steadily since then. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just the spring sun being stronger, but now... now it's really bothering me. It's definitely not just a normal sunburn feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, starting around the end of April, and progressively worsening. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any blistering, or any changes in the skin texture – like dryness, scaling, or thickening?
PATIENT: No blistering, thankfully. But you're right about the skin texture… it is drier, definitely. My face feels really tight sometimes, and I’ve been using lotion a lot more. And I think… yes, there’s a bit of scaling around my nose and on my cheeks. It's not bad, but I can see it if I look closely. It's kind of like… little flakes, you know? I hadn't really connected that to the sun sensitivity, but now that you mention it, yeah, there is.
DOCTOR: Okay, dryness and scaling around the nose and cheeks, in addition to the sensitivity and prickly sensation. That gives us some more information. Now, have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… changed anything? Not really, not that I can think of. Same soaps, same laundry detergent, same sunscreen… although, now that you mention it, I did switch brands of sunscreen in February. I used to use Neutrogena, but I tried a new one, a Banana Boat one, because it was on sale. Could that be it? I didn’t think much of it at the time, but maybe that’s when things started to get a little weird?
DOCTOR: That's a very important detail, thank you for bringing that up. Switching sunscreens could definitely be a contributing factor. Some people are sensitive to ingredients in certain brands. Before we go further, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and stuff. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… oh, I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. But other than that, nothing serious. I don’t really have any allergies that I know of. And… well, my wife passed away two years ago, so I’m still getting used to things, but that’s not really a medical thing, is it? Sorry, just… sometimes it comes up.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Komarov. It’s important to mention things like that, and I’m sorry for your loss. It's completely understandable that it's still on your mind. As for your medical history, that gives me a good starting point. No known allergies, and the appendix removal and pneumonia are noted. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things ticking, but that’s it. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but not very often. I try to avoid medication as much as possible, if I can. I don't really like taking pills, to be honest. Just the multivitamin, really. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. That’s good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Let me see... my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. He actually lost a foot to it, sadly. My sister is healthy, as far as I know, but we don’t see each other very often. And… well, my wife's family, I don't know much about their medical history. We didn't get to know them very well, unfortunately. Nothing about skin cancer or anything like that, as far as I'm aware. It wasn't something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. High blood pressure in your mother and diabetes in your father are noted. No known history of skin cancer in the family. Alright, Mr. Komarov, I’d like to take a look at your skin now, just to assess the sensitivity and scaling you’ve described. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. It's just… is it going to be uncomfortable? I'm a bit worried about it, to be honest. It feels quite tender already.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be uncomfortable, Mr. Komarov. I'll be very gentle. I'll just be looking at the areas you mentioned and feeling the texture of your skin. It won't involve any needles or anything like that. If anything does feel uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. I'm noting some mild erythema – redness – on your cheeks and forehead. The skin does appear slightly dry and I see some fine scaling around your nose and the corners of your mouth. There are no visible lesions or blistering. There is some mild tenderness to the touch, especially on your forehead and the backs of your arms. It's not severe, but it’s consistent with your description. I don’t feel any unusual lumps or bumps. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it's likely you’re experiencing a form of contact dermatitis, possibly triggered by the new sunscreen. It’s also possible it could be a mild form of photosensitivity.
PATIENT: Okay, contact dermatitis… that sounds… unpleasant. So, the sunscreen is probably the culprit then? Is it something I need to worry about? Will it get worse? And… what can I do about it? I really want to be able to go outside again without feeling like my skin is burning.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Komarov. Contact dermatitis can be uncomfortable, but it's rarely serious. Based on the timing and your symptoms, the new sunscreen is a very strong possibility. We'll need to rule out other causes, but it’s a good place to start. To be safe, I recommend immediately discontinuing the use of the Banana Boat sunscreen and switching back to the Neutrogena brand you used previously. It’s also important to avoid direct sun exposure as much as possible until your skin heals. I’m going to prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and relieve the itching and burning. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day for the next two weeks. In addition, I recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher whenever you are exposed to the sun, even on cloudy days. Wear protective clothing, such as a hat and long sleeves, and try to stay in the shade during peak sunlight hours. Does that sound manageable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Stopping the sunscreen and going back to the old one makes sense. And the cream, that’s good. I’m happy to try that. I do have a hat, so that's easy enough. So, if I stop using the new sunscreen and use the cream, it should get better? Is there anything else I need to be looking out for? Should I see a specialist if it doesn't improve? I don't want it to get worse, and I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: That’s the plan, Mr. Komarov. Stopping the new sunscreen and using the corticosteroid cream should help alleviate your symptoms within a week or two. It's important to be consistent with the application. As for what to look out for, if you notice any of the following, please contact me immediately: Widespread blistering or pus-filled bumps. Fever or chills. Severe pain or swelling. Any signs of infection, such as red streaks radiating from the affected area. If your symptoms don't improve after two weeks of consistent treatment, or if they worsen at any point, I recommend a referral to a dermatologist. They can perform further testing to rule out other potential causes and provide more specialized treatment if needed. I’ll write you a prescription for the corticosteroid cream and provide a handout with instructions on how to apply it. Do you have any questions about the cream or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds pretty clear. No blistering, fever, or anything like that. And I'll come back if it doesn't get better. Thank you, Dr. Seil. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It's a bit of a relief to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I'm glad I could help. Remember, it's always best to address these things early on. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician regarding this consultation. Here’s the prescription and the handout. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns. I hope you feel better soon. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Seil. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll follow your instructions and see how it goes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Komarov. You have a good day as well. Please take care.
