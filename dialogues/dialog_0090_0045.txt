DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It’s… well, my face gets red. Really red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and it's… not comfortable. It’s been going on a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A few weeks, you say. And you're not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: No, not sure. Time… it goes fast, you know? Especially now. I lost my wife last year. Everything feels… blurry since then. But the red face… that’s new-ish. Not from being sick, I don’t feel sick. Just… red. It comes and goes. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes just… happens.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s been happening for a few weeks, comes and goes, and doesn’t seem to be associated with any other illness. You mentioned it sometimes happens after eating. What do you typically eat when this occurs?
PATIENT: Oh, everything! I eat… well, whatever’s easy. I don't cook much anymore. Soup, sometimes. Rice and some vegetables. Noodles. Last night, I had a little bit of spicy chicken. But it happens with regular food too. Not just spicy. I really don’t know what brings it on. It's very confusing.
DOCTOR: “Confusing” is a good word for it. Alright. And when this flushing occurs, where exactly on your face does it happen?
PATIENT: It’s… all over, mostly. My cheeks, my nose, my forehead. And sometimes my neck gets red too. Not my ears, though. Never my ears. It feels warm, like a hot flash, but I’m not… a woman, you know? Just hot and red. It goes away after a little while. But it's embarrassing. People stare.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It sounds like you’re experiencing some sort of facial flushing. It could be a number of things, Mr. Withycombe. Let's go through some basics. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Not much. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But I don’t drink every day. Not even every week. My wife… she didn’t like it. So I stopped having it much after she… well, you know. It doesn’t make the red face happen, I don't think. Never noticed a connection.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. I try to stay healthy. Eat my vegetables, even if I don't cook much. I don't take pills. Never liked them. I just want this red face to go away. It's very distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history, and the fact that you’re otherwise healthy, it could be something relatively benign. But we need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to do a quick physical exam. It's just a standard check. We'll listen to your heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin a bit closer. Then we can decide if we need to run any tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s wrong. And if you can fix it, that would be wonderful. I don’t like being red all the time. It's… unsettling. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just sit up here. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Nothing too concerning at the moment, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Heart sounds regular. Skin appears… normal. No rash, no obvious lesions. Flushing is present, as you described, predominantly on the cheeks and nose. Capillaries seem… a little dilated. Hmm. Do you experience any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes, I feel a little… warm, like I have a fever, but I don’t. No chills, no cough. Just warm. And… a little bit dizzy sometimes. Not falling down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And my nose might… tingle. A little. It’s hard to say, honestly. It all happens at once. The red face, the warmth, the dizziness… it’s all mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Warmth, dizziness, tingling in the nose… Those could be related. Given your age and the lack of other serious symptoms, it could be rosacea, or possibly vasomotor instability. But we need to rule out anything more serious. I’m going to order some basic blood work: a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Just to be thorough. And I want you to keep a food diary for the next week. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when the flushing occurs. That will help us identify any potential triggers. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reasonable. Blood work and a food diary. I can do that. It’s a little bit of work, but if it helps… I’ll write everything down. Everything. And I’ll tell you exactly when the red face shows up. Is there a special notebook I should use? Or can I just use… regular paper? And where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Regular paper is fine, Mr. Withycombe. Don’t overthink it. And you can go to the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital. They’re the closest one. I’ll print you a requisition form. Bring this with you. They’ll take care of everything. The results should be back in about a week. Then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to manage your stress. It can exacerbate these types of symptoms. And avoid anything that seems to trigger the flushing. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. St. Jude’s Hospital, requisition form, a week for the results, and… manage my stress. That’s… difficult. But I’ll try. I really will. It's just… everything feels overwhelming sometimes. But I’ll do the food diary and try to relax. And I’ll see you in a week. Thank you, Doctor Kur. I appreciate your help. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or anything I should avoid completely?
DOCTOR: Avoid excessive alcohol and caffeine. Spicy foods might be a trigger, but we’ll see what the diary reveals. And honestly, Mr. Withycombe, try to get some more sleep. It’s crucial for overall health. We'll re-evaluate after the lab results. If the symptoms worsen significantly, or you develop any new symptoms – fever, severe headache, chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just focus on the diary and try to relax. We'll see what we find. Have a good day, Mr. Withycombe.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No alcohol, no caffeine, be careful with spicy food, get more sleep… and go to the emergency room if things get bad. I’ll remember all that. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. You’ve been very helpful. Have a good day to you too.
