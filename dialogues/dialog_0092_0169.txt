DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to ya. Giganti, you say? Sounds... foreign. Anyway, it's my face and legs, see? They're puffed up. Been happenin' a bit lately, and it's gettin' on my nerves. Can’t rightly say why though. Old age, probably. Not like it’s a surprise, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. “Puffed up,” you say – primarily your face and legs?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Mostly. Sometimes my hands feel a bit thick too, but it comes and goes. Hard to say what sets it off. I haven’t changed nothin' in my routine, not for a long time, anyway. It’s just… there. And it’s bothersome. Makes my boots a bit tight, ya know? And I like a comfortable boot. Important for a fella my age.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A comfortable boot is important. And I appreciate you being so specific. To get a better understanding, could you tell me about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Now that’s a good question. Honestly, doc, I don’t recall precisely. It wasn’t sudden, not like I woke up one morning lookin’ like a balloon. It just… crept up on me, bit by bit. Maybe a few months ago? Hard to say with certainty. Things blur when you get to be my age, ya know? I've had a full life, mind you. A full life. Doesn't mean I remember every little detail.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s perfectly normal not to recall an exact start date, especially if it was gradual. Let's say approximately a few months ago then. Has anything specific seemed to make it worse – like certain foods, activities, or the time of day?
PATIENT: Foods? No, I eat what I always eat. Meat and potatoes, mostly. A bit of fish now and again. Not one of those fancy eaters, me. And activities… well, I don’t do much these days. Bit of soldering here and there, keepin' my hands busy, but that ain't changed. Time of day… maybe a bit worse in the evenin’? When I've been on my feet all day. But honestly, it’s hard to say for sure. I'm tellin' ya, doc, it just is. A general discomfort. And a tight boot. I can’t emphasize that enough. A tight boot is unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Miner, and I agree – a comfortable boot is essential. Since it seems to be worse in the evenings after being on your feet, and you haven't noticed any changes in your diet or activities, let's delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. Old man Withers down the road kept goin’ on about his blood pressure. Had to watch his salt intake, he said. Mine? Never been told anythin’ like that. Doc said I was a strong lad back when I used to go for check-ups, though that was ages ago. And diabetes… no, never. I like my sweets, mind you, but not enough to cause somethin' like that. Kidney problems… sounds serious. Can't say I've ever had anythin' wrong with my kidneys. Mostly just a general wear and tear, I suppose. Been around a long time, ya know? A long time. A full life. Though the puffiness is makin' it a bit less enjoyable. And the tight boots… well, you get the idea. .
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
