DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's about getting some shots. My granddaughter... she's trying to get settled here, and I believe she needs some proof of vaccinations for her visa. I'm trying to help her with everything, but I'm not sure what all is required.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, you say. For a visa application. Hmm. While I can certainly review your vaccination records – assuming we have records here – I must state that my practice focuses on your personal medical care, Mr. Skarbek, not documentation for legal purposes. However, let's see what we can ascertain. Do you recall which vaccinations your granddaughter specifically needs documented?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. That makes sense. I don't have any records here, Doctor, I've been to a few different places over the years. And honestly, I’m not sure which ones she needs. She just told me “vaccinations” and something about needing paperwork from a doctor. She's dealing with a lot of the application stuff herself, and I'm not very good with all the details. Is there a list somewhere of what’s usually required? Perhaps for someone her age? She’s… twenty-two, I believe.
DOCTOR: Twenty-two, alright. It is rather difficult to provide a specific list without knowing her country of origin and the visa type. Requirements vary significantly. I can, however, access some general guidelines. … Here we are. For a twenty-two-year-old, a standard set of vaccinations generally includes verification of measles, mumps, rubella , diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis , varicella , and influenza. Hepatitis A and B are often recommended, as is the HPV vaccine, although that's typically given earlier in life. Now, have you had these vaccinations yourself, Mr. Skarbek?
PATIENT: Well, goodness. That’s a lot of names! I remember getting some shots when I was a boy… and a booster or two over the years, but I couldn't tell you which ones those were. It was a long time ago. I mostly just went when my mother told me to. I've never really kept track. And I'm afraid I don't know anything about Hep… whatever those are either. Is it important if I haven’t had those for her paperwork? I just want to make sure she has what she needs to stay here legally.
DOCTOR: It’s essential to understand that her vaccination requirements are independent of your own, Mr. Skarbek. We need to focus on her record, not yours. The necessity of Hepatitis A and B vaccinations will depend on her travel history and the specific requirements of the visa application. Do you happen to know where she is applying from, and what the purpose of the visa is—student, work, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You're right to focus on her. I get flustered sometimes. She's applying from… Venezuela, I believe. And it's for a student visa. She got accepted to a college here. A small one, out near Tulsa. She’s very bright, always been a good student. She wants to study… engineering, I think. Does that help at all? About the vaccinations, I mean. Knowing it's for a student from Venezuela.
DOCTOR: Venezuela… student visa… Right. Generally, for a student visa from Venezuela, proof of MMR, DTaP, and varicella is frequently required. Some institutions and the visa authorities may also request a tuberculosis test, given the prevalence in certain regions. We should also consider her age and any potential previous vaccinations she may have received. Has she brought any vaccination records with her—perhaps from doctors in Venezuela?
PATIENT: No, she hasn't. She said she didn't have any. That's why she asked me to come see a doctor. She's a little worried about all of it, to be honest. She's never been to America before and doesn't speak much English. She's very brave, trying to start over like this. But I'm not sure what we do if she doesn't have any records. Can those be… recreated somehow? Or is that not possible?
DOCTOR: Recreating vaccination records is… complicated, Mr. Skarbek. It’s generally not recommended due to the potential for inaccuracies and legal ramifications. However, if she has no documentation, we can perform a blood test to check for immunity to certain diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. This will tell us if she has pre-existing immunity, but it won’t provide official records. If the results show no immunity, she will need to receive the vaccinations. It’s the safest course of action, even without prior records. We can document the vaccinations here at the clinic, but it may not be sufficient for the visa application. It depends on the specific requirements of the embassy or consulate. Perhaps she should contact them directly to inquire about acceptable forms of documentation. Now, let’s proceed with a basic physical exam and some blood work. It will give us a starting point. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky that way, thankfully. A basic exam sounds good. Whatever we need to do to help her. I appreciate you taking the time to explain all this. It’s a lot to take in, but I’m trying my best. Where do we start with the exam?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s begin with your vital signs. Please have a seat, and I will measure your blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. This is a standard assessment, Mr. Skarbek, just to ensure there are no underlying conditions that might impact your health. Please remove your shirt and have a seat.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. I haven’t had a proper exam in… goodness, I don’t even remember. I hope I don't make a mess of anything. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 86. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Your physical exam is unremarkable, Mr. Skarbek. Now, let’s proceed with the blood work to assess your immunity levels. The nurse will be in shortly to draw a sample. It is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds good, Doctor. I’m glad everything seems okay. I always worry a little when I go to the doctor. I’ll just wait here, then, for the nurse. Thank you again for your help with this. It puts my mind at ease, knowing she’s getting the care she needs.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you momentarily. In the meantime, I will document these findings and prepare the requisitions for the blood work. We'll proceed methodically, Mr. Skarbek. It's the only way. It's important to be thorough, especially given the circumstances. It's all quite… inconvenient.
PATIENT: Yes, I understand, Doctor. It is… a lot of trouble, to be sure. But she deserves a good life, and if these shots are what it takes, then so be it. I just want to make sure everything is done correctly, so she doesn't run into any problems. Is there anything I need to be doing while we wait? Filling out forms, or something like that? I’d rather be helpful than just sit here and worry.
DOCTOR: There are no forms to fill out at this time, Mr. Skarbek. The requisitions for the blood work are sufficient. Simply remain seated and try to relax. The nurse will explain the procedure when she arrives. Frankly, your concern is… admirable, but somewhat excessive. It’s a simple vaccination process. We'll take it from there. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I understand you're busy. Simple process… easy for you to say, I suppose. I just hope everything goes alright for her.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly, Mr. Skarbek. Please refrain from speaking until addressed. I need to ensure all necessary documentation is prepared. This is… quite a predicament. We'll proceed with caution. Now, if you'll excuse me... .
PATIENT: .
