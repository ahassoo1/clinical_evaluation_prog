DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Right. Nails. They... look funny. Not like they used to. I don't know what it is. They just... changed. I think. It was a while ago, honestly. I don’t keep track of dates much.
DOCTOR: "Changed" how, exactly?
PATIENT: Well... darker, maybe? And kinda thick. Not smooth like they should be. I get manicures sometimes, but the lady said she couldn’t do it this time. Said something about... a fungus? I dunno. I just want them to look normal again. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. A change in nail color and thickness… that can be a sign of a fungal infection, yes. But there are other possibilities. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, that’s what I mean! I told you, I don’t remember dates! It was… after the summer, I think? Last summer? Or maybe the one before? They always blur together, honestly. It was definitely warm out. It’s not like it's a big deal. Just nails.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “after the summer” gives us a rough timeframe. And it is helpful, even if it’s not precise. Have you had any injury to any of these nails?
PATIENT: Injury? No. Not that I recall. I do a lot of gardening, but I wear gloves. Mostly. Sometimes I forget. But I don’t think I hurt them. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to my hands. They just are.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort with these nails?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… sensitive, maybe, when I type. But nothing I can't handle. It's more annoying than painful, if that makes sense. It's just... not nice to look at.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look. Please extend your hands for me. I’m going to examine them closely. I'll need to assess the condition of the nails themselves and look at the skin around them.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just be quick about it, alright? I have things to do. Not that anything important is happening, but... you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some thickening and discoloration, particularly on the second and fifth nails of both hands. There’s some brittleness as well. No pitting that I can see immediately. Skin around the nail beds appears normal, no redness or swelling. I don’t see any signs of infection around the nails, which is good. They do appear somewhat distorted, though. Hmm. Do you have any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Health conditions? Not that I know of. The doctor always says I'm "perfectly healthy" for my age. I eat okay, I guess. Mostly. I don't really exercise. I used to... a long time ago. It's not like it matters much. Why, is something wrong with my nails? Don't tell me it's something awful.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily "awful," Ms. Thut. But this could be onychomycosis – a fungal infection of the nail. It's common. However, nail changes can also be caused by other things, like psoriasis or even trauma we don’t recall. To be certain, we’ll need to send a sample of the nail clippings to the lab for a fungal culture. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. The doctor gave it to me a while back. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. Just when it's really bad. I don't take them every day, though. Honestly, I forget half the time if I’ve even taken them. This whole thing is just a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good you mentioned the blood pressure medication. We’ll need to rule out any drug-related causes for the nail changes. Okay, so here’s what I’d like to do. I'm going to clip a small sample of the nail clippings from both hands to send to the lab for analysis. It’s a quick and painless procedure. While we’re waiting for the results—which usually take about two weeks—I recommend keeping your nails trimmed and dry. We will also review your medical history and any prior lab results to provide you with an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Two weeks? That’s a long time to wait. But... I guess it's better than nothing. Fine. Whatever. Just... be gentle, alright? And don’t take too much off. I still want them to look like something. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s done. As I said, a small sample is all they need. I’m sending the requisition to the lab now. They’ll contact you directly with the results. In the meantime, I'm going to document my findings and recommendations in your chart. We’ll discuss treatment options once we have the lab results, Ms. Thut. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think I've told you everything I know, which isn’t much. Honestly, I just want this to be over. I hope it's not something serious. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today. I’ve given the nurse instructions to provide you with a handout on nail care. She'll also give you the lab requisition information in case you need to follow up with them. We will call you when the results are available. I understand you're anxious, Ms. Thut, and we'll do our best to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. It's unlikely to be something serious, but we need to confirm with the lab first. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, I guess. Fine. Goodbye.
