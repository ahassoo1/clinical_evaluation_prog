DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner… Derick, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Derick. Just Derick is fine. Look, I ain’t one for formalities. Though, honestly, I barely remember what day it is most days. August, you say? Seems about right. It’s just… this puffiness, see? It’s been botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Puffiness. Right. And where, exactly, is this puffiness located?
PATIENT: Well, all over, really. Face, mostly. Makes me look like a… a pufferfish, my wife used to say. God rest her soul. And my legs… ankles, especially. They feel kinda… tight. Like they’re gonna burst, sometimes. It’s uncomfortable, is what I’m gettin’ at.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized swelling… face and lower extremities. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a tough one. Seems like… weeks, maybe? Hard to say. Time kinda… blurs. It was worse a little while back, I think. Now it comes and goes. Not as bad, but still… there. I don’t pay much attention to these things, truthfully. It's probably nothin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else along with this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I get tired easier, I suppose. But I’m gettin’ on in years, ain’t I? That's just part of it. And my appetite’s been a bit off, but I don't eat much anyway. Not since… well, nevermind. Nothing really noticeable. It’s just the puffiness, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of…breath? Not particularly. I mean, I get winded walkin' up the stairs, but that’s always been the case. I never was much of an athlete. You know, I used to be able to weld all day without a problem, but these days… a little bit of exertion and I gotta sit down. Does that count?
DOCTOR: So, exertion-related shortness of breath… and you've noticed this correlating with the swelling?
PATIENT: Correlatin’… you mean, when I’m puffier, it’s harder to breathe? Maybe. I never really put two and two together like that. I just figured I was gettin’ old. Everything hurts when you get old, right? Honestly, doc, I don't spend a lot of time thinkin’ about what’s causing what. I just deal with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Not that I know of. My wife always said I was as stubborn as a mule, which I suppose could be bad for the heart. But the doctor always said my ticker was strong. Regular as a clock, he used to say. That was… oh, must be ten years ago now. Things change, don’t they? I haven't seen a doctor since… well, since she passed.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… now that’s a good question. Not that I recall. I don't take nothin’ regularly. Tried some pills for my arthritis a while back, but they didn't do much and made me feel kinda sick, so I stopped takin’ ‘em. I prefer to just… tough it out, you know? Makes me feel stronger. Though, honestly, I can’t even remember what they were called.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmph. My mother lived to be eighty-something, I think. Heart trouble, maybe? Everyone gets something when they get old. My father… he was a strong man, worked in the shipyard. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. Though, he drank a bit. Does that count? I wouldn't say we were a family that talked much about illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Oh. Sure, I can manage. Bit creaky, though. There. Not as spry as I used to be, that’s for sure. Be careful now, I don’t want to fall and break somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. There’s definitely some pitting edema here. And your pulse is a little weak. Lungs sound a little congested. Blood pressure is… elevated. Let’s sit back down. So, we’ve got swelling, congestion, weak pulse, and high blood pressure. I think we need to run some tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Tests… what kinda tests? I don’t do so well with… things poked and prodded. And I ain’t got insurance, doc. That’s gonna be a problem, ain’t it? I just figured this was somethin’ minor.
DOCTOR: We’ll need a blood test—to check your kidney function and electrolytes—and an EKG—to look at your heart rhythm. And I’d like to order a chest X-ray. As for the cost… we can discuss options. But these are necessary to get a better idea of what's going on. It could be something simple, or it could be something more serious. I can’t tell without more information. I'm thinking potentially heart failure or kidney issues. It's best to rule things out.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Kidney… issues? Oh, Lord. That sounds… serious. My wife… she had heart trouble. That’s how she… I don’t want no tests if it's gonna tell me bad news. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe just… rest? Drink more water?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Miner, I understand your hesitation. But ignoring this won’t make it go away. Rest and water are always good, but they won’t tell us what’s causing the swelling. I’m ordering the tests. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. I’ll also write you a prescription for a diuretic—that’ll help get rid of some of the fluid. But this is just a temporary measure. We need the test results to determine the best course of action. Let’s just get this done, okay?
PATIENT: A diuretic… more pills. Fine. Whatever you say, doc. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. And I really don’t want to know if somethin’s seriously wrong. Just… do what you gotta do. Let’s get it over with. What do I gotta do first?
DOCTOR: First, the lab. It's just a blood draw, they're right down the hall. Then, the EKG and X-ray. The nurse will take you to those rooms. The diuretic prescription is for the pharmacy; take it with food, and drink plenty of water. And I’ll need you to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Nurse will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to ask them any questions.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Thank you, doc. I… I guess I’ll go find the nurse.
