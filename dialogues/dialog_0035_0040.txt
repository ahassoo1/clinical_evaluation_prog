DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it's this pain in my side again, mostly. And… I seem to be getting infections quite a lot lately. It’s been happening for a while now, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and frequent infections. Let’s start with the pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's… well, it's on my left side, mostly. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it's a deep ache. Not sharp, not like a sudden thing. More…constant, if that makes sense? It sometimes goes through to my back a little, too. It doesn't always happen after I eat, or anything specific. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep, constant ache on your left side, sometimes radiating to your back. And it doesn’t seem to be related to eating or any particular activity. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It's been… years, really. Maybe five or six years? It comes and goes in waves, you see. There are times I barely notice it, and then other times it's… harder to ignore. The infections are more recent, though. The last year or so, I’ve had a few.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain has been ongoing for five or six years, fluctuating in intensity. And the frequent infections are a more recent development – within the last year. Can you tell me a bit more about these infections?
PATIENT: Yes, well, they’re… urinary tract infections, the doctor at the hospital told me. Quite painful, of course. I have to take medicine for them, and then they go away… but they keep coming back. I’ve had three, I think, in the last year. Maybe four. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, recurrent urinary tract infections over the past year. Three or four episodes, you said. Do you remember anything specific about them?
PATIENT: Yes, well, they all feel… similar. A burning feeling when I go to the toilet, a lot of urgency, you know? And a bit of pain in my lower tummy. Nothing too severe, but enough to make me uncomfortable. The doctor always says it’s a UTI, gives me antibiotics, and it clears up. But like I said, they just keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, urgency, and lower abdominal pain. And the antibiotics are temporarily resolving the infections. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. The hospital doctor… he told me I have something called polycystic kidney disease. That’s what he said was causing the pain and the infections, I think. He explained it a bit, but to be honest, I didn’t understand all of it. It has something to do with cysts on my kidneys, he said.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That explains a lot. Do you remember what the doctor told you about how this condition might be affecting your side pain and your susceptibility to infections?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. He said the cysts… they can cause pain, because they get bigger, and press on things. And something about the way the kidneys work… it makes it easier to get infections. But it was a lot of information, and I’m an old man, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. I just remember he said I’d need to be monitored.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Espinueva. It is a lot to take in. And monitoring is definitely important. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries. Just the usual things, like getting my tonsils out when I was a boy, a long time ago. Nothing major in recent years, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of anyone in your family who has kidney problems, or any similar health issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother, he had some trouble with his waterworks when he got older, but I don’t know what exactly. No one else that I can recall having kidney problems specifically. We didn’t talk about these things much in my family, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean by that, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I mean things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or what your typical diet is like. Also, what is your living situation like – do you live alone or with someone?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Well, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. I used to, a little, years ago, but not anymore. My diet… I try to eat healthy. Lots of fish, fruits, vegetables. Nothing too fancy. I live alone, Doctor. My wife passed away a few years ago, and I don’t have any children.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine. I’ve taken a few different things over the years, for colds and things, but nothing has ever bothered me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for that information. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen. I’ll also check your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. It might be a little tender, so please let me know if you feel any pain. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. I'm also going to check for a costovertebral angle tenderness. There is mild tenderness on the left side. Based on the exam, there’s some tenderness in your left flank and along your left costovertebral angle. This, along with your history of recurrent UTIs and diagnosed polycystic kidney disease, is concerning for a possible kidney infection or complications related to the PKD. I want to order some blood work and a urine analysis to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to have them. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel better.
DOCTOR: Good. The blood work will check your kidney function and look for signs of infection. The urine analysis will confirm if you have an active UTI and help identify the bacteria causing it. I'll also order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at your kidneys and rule out any other complications. While we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day – to help flush out your system. Also, avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. I’ll get the lab orders sent over, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, which should be within a couple of days. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or side, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Drinking plenty of water, avoiding caffeine and alcohol… and going to the emergency room if things get worse. I understand. Thank you very much for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
