DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have all day. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And half my face feels…wrong. Droopy, I suppose. It’s quite obvious, really. Do you need me to explain further?
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. I understand you’re experiencing sudden hearing loss in one ear and facial drooping. That definitely warrants a thorough look. “Quite obvious” is helpful, but I’ll need to ask you some questions to get a better understanding of what’s going on. First, can you tell me when exactly you noticed these symptoms this morning?
PATIENT: This morning. I just told you. When I woke up. Honestly, are you even listening? It wasn’t gradual, it wasn’t… anything. One minute everything was fine, the next it wasn’t. Is there a point to all these questions, or are we just playing twenty questions here?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the seemingly obvious questions, Stephane. It's important for me to document everything accurately. Sudden onset is significant. Okay. And has this been accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Like what? A parade? What else would accompany it? No, nothing. Just…this. The deafness and the face. It’s very inconvenient, you know. I have things to do. I run a very busy practice, and I can’t be sitting around explaining every single detail of my morning to… well. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Stephane. I'll do my best to be efficient. To be thorough, I need to ask a few more questions, then I’ll perform a quick examination. Have you experienced any dizziness, headache, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache? No. Vision? Perfectly fine, thank you very much. I had my eyes checked last year. Really, doctor, are you trying to be deliberately obtuse? It's deafness and facial weakness. That is the problem. Do you need a detailed account of my breakfast as well? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Stephane, I appreciate your frustration, and I apologize if my questions feel redundant. I am not trying to be obtuse, but I need to rule out other possibilities to ensure I get the right diagnosis. Sudden deafness and facial weakness can sometimes be a sign of a more serious condition. Let's try this differently. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No. Perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I don't get sick. I simply don’t have time for it. I take vitamins, I eat well… honestly, I’m a very careful person. It’s highly improbable that this is due to a common cold. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply going in circles? I have patients waiting, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any history of ear infections, ringing in the ears, or any head trauma?
PATIENT: Ear infections? When I was a child, perhaps. A very long time ago. Ringing? Occasionally, but nothing significant. And head trauma? Absolutely not. I haven’t so much as bumped my head. This is… frustrating. I am a radiologist, doctor. I understand the importance of a thorough history, but this is bordering on the absurd. Is there a way to simply fix this, or am I going to be here all day answering pointless questions?
DOCTOR: Stephane, I understand your expertise and your frustration. Given your profession, you're right to be concerned about a quick and accurate diagnosis. I assure you I'm not trying to waste your time. The questions are essential to rule out various causes, some of which require immediate attention. Now, given the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness, and without any other reported symptoms, the most concerning possibility we need to rule out is Bell’s palsy. However, other causes, like stroke or a tumor, need to be considered. To do that, I need to perform a quick neurological examination. Would you be willing to let me do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get on with it. The examination, I mean. But if this involves poking and prodding for an extended period, I’m leaving. I have a schedule to maintain. And if it’s going to be a long process, perhaps you could explain what you're actually looking for? Just so I'm not completely in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain as I go. I'll be checking your facial muscle strength, reflexes, and sensation. I'll also look in your ears and listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take long, maybe five to ten minutes. First, let’s start with your ears. Could you please look straight ahead?
PATIENT: Get it over with. I don’t enjoy having things stuck in my ears. Honestly, the things they use these days... it’s quite barbaric.
DOCTOR: Okay. The ear canals appear clear. Your ear drums are intact, although there is slight redness on the affected side. No obvious signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I'm going to ask you to smile for me. Just a nice, wide smile.
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's not exactly easy when half your face feels paralyzed. This is…uncomfortable. Are you sure you’re qualified to do this? I might just go straight to a specialist. A neurologist, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, please close your eyes tightly, and don’t let me pull them open. Now, puff out your cheeks. I see. There's definite weakness on the left side of your face. The left eyelid doesn't close as strongly, and there's less puffiness when you blow out your cheeks. Given the sudden onset, the lack of other symptoms, and the physical examination findings, it’s highly suggestive of Bell’s palsy. However, we can't rule out other causes entirely. To be certain, I recommend an MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be willing to pursue an MRI?
PATIENT: An MRI? Really? Must we? That’s… inconvenient. And expensive, I presume? Look, I understand you’re being thorough, but Bell’s palsy? Is it serious? Will I…will my face be like this forever? And if it is Bell’s palsy, what does that even mean? I suppose an MRI is… necessary, if you insist. But I expect a quick turnaround. I can’t have my practice disrupted for weeks waiting for results. And you will need to provide me with a referral immediately. I have patients waiting, you know. This is… exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. It is frustrating, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Bell's palsy is often temporary, and most people make a full recovery, usually within a few weeks to a few months. However, an MRI will help us rule out other potential causes and ensure we’re providing the best possible care. I'm writing a referral for an MRI now. The report will be sent to your primary care physician, and I’ll also review it with you as soon as it’s available. In the meantime, I’m prescribing a course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and improve your chances of recovery. I also recommend using artificial tears to keep your eye lubricated, as you may not be able to close it completely, and protecting your eye from dust and dryness. I will also give you information on physical therapy exercises to help strengthen the facial muscles. Do you have any questions about the medication, the MRI, or the exercises?
PATIENT: Corticosteroids... side effects? I assume there are side effects. I’ll need to look those up. Physical therapy... exercises? Is there anything I won’t be doing? Look, I appreciate the information, but frankly, I’m overwhelmed. Just… give me the papers. And I suppose I should schedule a follow-up appointment, just to… check on things? But make it quick, doctor. As quick as possible. I have a practice to run. And honestly, this whole experience has been… thoroughly unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the details for the MRI, the prescription, and the information on physical therapy. The side effects of the corticosteroids are listed on the information sheet, but please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ve scheduled a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, to assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a few days, please call the clinic immediately. I understand your frustration, Stephane, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. I hope you have a speedy recovery. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. Have a good day, and take care. .
