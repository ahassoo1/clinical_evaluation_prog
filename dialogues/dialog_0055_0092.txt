DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dr. Eaddy, you say? Hmm. Well, I'm gettin' old, that's for sure. Been feelin'…short of breath. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, always dry. Eyes too, scratchy like. Don’t know what it is, really. Just…not good. It's been happenin' a little while now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Time flies, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does. “Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes…” I see. And when you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate…? Ugh. Look, I don't keep calendars for my body, alright? Maybe…a few months? Could be longer. I been busy. Traffic lights don't fix themselves, you know. Used to be able to run up and down those poles like a monkey. Now…not so much. It just…crept up on me, this feelin'. Not one day I woke up and said "Oh, now I'm short of breath!". It's gradual, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Gradual onset is…common. And is this shortness of breath constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I reckon. Mostly when I…well, when I do somethin'. Walkin' up the stairs is a killer now. Even just gettin' the mail. If I’m sittin' still, watchin' the baseball game, I’m alright. Mostly. Sometimes even then I gotta take a few deep breaths. It's annoyin', that's what it is. And this dryness…always there. Like cottonmouth. You ever had cottonmouth? Terrible. Just terrible.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am familiar with the sensation. So, shortness of breath on exertion, and persistent dry mouth. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think. I… sometimes feel a little tired. But I’m eighty-three years old! What do you expect? I don’t bounce around like a young fella. Maybe a little dizzy sometimes, but that could just be standin’ up too fast. I don’t know. I ain’t payin' attention to every little ache and pain, doc. I got things to do! Traffic lights, remember? Don’t think I got time to be catalogin' every sniffle and sneeze.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh boy. That was a long time ago. Doc gave me somethin' for my blood pressure, years back. High blood pressure, he said. Took pills for a while. Stopped takin’ ‘em, though. Felt better without ‘em. And…I think I had the flu once. Bad flu. But that was decades ago. Don’t remember much else. I ain't one for doctors, see? Avoid ‘em when I can. Always tellin’ me somethin’s wrong. I feel what I feel, and I deal with it. That's my philosophy. You got a problem with that?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guilds, I do not have a "problem" with your philosophy. However, stopping prescribed medication can sometimes have…unforeseen consequences. Do you recall the name of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Consequences, huh? Well, everything has consequences, don't it? Like stayin' out in the sun too long. Or eatin' too much cake. As for the name… Ugh. Nope. Not a clue. Little white pill, that’s all I remember. Doc wrote somethin' on a piece of paper, but I probably threw it away. I don't keep medical records in my pocket, you know. Too busy. Look, I told you, I ain’t one for all this doctor stuff. Can we just figure out what’s wrong with my breath and my mouth? That’s what I came here for. I got things to do, remember? Traffic lights...
DOCTOR: Yes, we will address your shortness of breath and dry mouth. But understanding your past medical history is crucial. Alright. Let’s try this. Have you had any surgeries in your life?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think…Hmm. Now, old Man Hemandez, the guy who used to live next door, he had a surgery. Bad knee, I think. I went to visit him in the hospital. But me? I don't recall ever bein’ under the knife. Maybe when I was a little boy? A tonsillectomy, maybe? But I don't even remember that. I mostly remember my mother fussin' over me afterward. But that was… a long, long time ago. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from climbin' those poles. You know, fixin’ traffic lights? It's dangerous work. And I ain't been to a doctor in… well, I don't even want to think about it. What year is it anyway?
DOCTOR: It is August 2nd, 2025, Mr. Guilds. And while I appreciate your… resilience, your lack of detailed medical history is… less than ideal. Very well. Let’s move on to your family. Is there any history of heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Heart problems…? Ugh. My old man… he wasn’t a healthy fella. Always complainin’ about his chest. Didn't take care of himself, smoked like a chimney. Died when I was young, though. Don’t remember much else about it. Lung disease… my aunt Rosa, she had a cough. Bad cough, always wheezin’. Spent a lot of time in bed. As for diabetes… hmm. I think my cousin Miguel had that. Always talkin' about sugar. But everybody in my family loves sugar! Cakes, pastries… it’s a Cuban thing, you know? Look, doc, I’m tellin’ you, everybody in my family has somethin’. It don’t mean nothin’. Can we just get to the point? What's wrong with me? I got traffic lights to worry about! They don't fix themselves, you know! It's important work. Real important.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and perhaps take a look at your mouth and throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. But don’t expect miracles. I'm an old man, doc. Things are gonna be… broken. But I still gotta climb those poles, you know? Someone’s gotta keep the traffic flowin’. And I’m the guy to do it. Just… be gentle, alright? And hurry it up. I got places to be. Traffic lights… they're callin' my name. Seriously. They just… need fixin’. It's a responsibility, see? A big one. So, get on with it. Let's get this over with. And don't tell me nothin' I don't wanna hear. Just fix me, alright? That's all I ask. Just... fix me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guilds. Please take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your breathing sounds slightly wheezy, and your heart rate is a bit elevated. Blood pressure is 140/90. Your mouth is dry, as you mentioned, and your throat appears slightly inflamed. Now, could you please tell me if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Ugh. See, this is what I mean! Always askin' about somethin' I don't know! I don't keep a list of things that make me itch, alright? I took some pills once, for my cough, years ago. But I don't remember what they were. Didn't itch, didn't swell up, didn't explode or nothin'. Just… took 'em. Maybe penicillin? I think someone said somethin' about penicillin once. Old Man Hemandez, maybe? He was always gettin' sick. Honestly, doc, I'm lucky if I remember what I had for breakfast. Allergies… it's a mystery, alright? A complete mystery. Just… assume I'm allergic to everything and get on with it, okay? This is a waste of time. I got traffic lights… you wouldn't believe the problems they're causin' right now! Honestly. A disaster. And I'm the only one who can fix 'em. So, please. No more questions about allergies, okay? Just… fix me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. Given your vague recollection, we will proceed with caution. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… vitamins… Ugh. Look, I got some aspirin in my bathroom. For my head, sometimes. When it aches. But I don’t take it every day. Maybe once a month? Honestly, doc, I’m not a hypochondriac, alright? I don’t pop pills like candy. I got some ointment for my feet, too. They get sore from climbin’ those poles. But that's it. Just aspirin and foot ointment. That's all. I don’t believe in all these fancy medicines. They just make you feel worse, I reckon. I got a strong constitution, see? Built tough. Like a Cuban coffee. Strong and bitter. That’s me. So, no, I ain’t takin’ nothin’ regularly. Just… aspirin sometimes. And foot ointment. Now, can we please be done with this? I'm losin' daylight here. Traffic lights… they won’t fix themselves, you know! Seriously. They're causin' a real mess. A complete disaster. Just... fix me, alright? That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. Based on your history and examination, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with mild dehydration, possible bronchitis, and age-related decline in oral mucous membranes. However, given your limited recall and the potential for underlying issues, I recommend further testing. I would like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to rule out any serious complications. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests…? Blood tests, X-rays… Ugh. Are you serious, doc? You want to poke and prod me like a pig? I ain’t got time for all that nonsense. I got traffic lights to fix! I told you! Complete blood count, basic… what-now…? It’s ridiculous! I’m eighty-three years old, alright? Things are gonna be a little… worn out. You don’t need a fancy machine to tell you that! I feel fine! Mostly. Just a little short of breath and a dry mouth. That's all! I’m not dyin’, alright? Just… old. And busy. I got responsibilities! Traffic lights! They’re callin’ my name. And I need to answer that call. No tests! Absolutely not! I’m leavin’. I’ll just… drink some water and try to relax. And if I don’t feel better, I’ll… I’ll climb another traffic light! It usually helps. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your reluctance, but as a medical professional, I cannot simply dismiss potential health concerns without proper investigation. While you may feel capable now, ignoring these symptoms could lead to more serious complications down the line. I strongly advise you to reconsider. The tests are relatively simple and will provide me with valuable information to ensure your well-being. If you are truly unwilling to proceed, I will document your refusal. However, I must inform you that I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan without further evaluation. .
