DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Clarke. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they’re really bothering me. They’re red and… well, they hurt. Especially when I walk. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a couple of months?
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. A couple of months of red, painful bumps on your shins. That does sound bothersome. To get a better understanding, can you describe the bumps a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. They’re kinda hard, you know? Not soft. And they’re… roundish, I guess. Not flat. They stick out a little. Maybe about the size of a pea, some are a little bigger. And like I said, they’re pretty red. I haven't noticed any pus or anything coming out of them, if that makes sense. They just… ache. Mostly when I'm on my feet a lot, doing work.
DOCTOR: Okay, hard, roundish bumps, pea-sized, red, and aching with activity. No pus, you said. That’s helpful. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them better?
PATIENT: Well... nothing really makes them better better, you know? Resting helps a little. When I sit down and put my feet up, the pain goes away. But as soon as I start moving around, especially if I’m doing something physical at work, they start hurting again. I haven’t really tried anything special on them, just soap and water when I shower. I figured maybe they’d go away on their own. They haven’t, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting provides some relief, but activity brings the pain back. You’ve tried soap and water, but nothing else. Have you had anything like this happen before, Clarke?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had my share of scrapes and bruises from work, you know, being a mover and all. But never these hard, red bumps. And definitely not ones that ache like this. My wife, Elena, she hasn’t seen anything like it on me either. She's usually pretty good at spotting things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No previous occurrences, and your wife hasn't observed anything similar. I'd like to take a look at them, if you don't mind. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. No problem at all. Here you go, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to move them around or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. I see what you mean. There are several raised, erythematous nodules on both shins. They are firm to the touch, and you’re right, they are tender. No warmth to the touch, no drainage, and skin appears intact other than the nodules themselves. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Ery-what-eous? Oh… red, you mean? Yes, they’re red. And they hurt when I press on them, like you’re doing. No, that’s about it, really. No fever, no chills, no other aches… just the bumps on my legs and the pain. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything like that. Just… bothered by these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, erythematous means red. Sorry for the medical term – I sometimes forget to simplify. No fever, no chills, no other aches. That’s good. Now, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I mean, I’m an old man, so things ache sometimes, but nothing the doctor ever told me was wrong with me, you know? My wife keeps telling me to get my cholesterol checked, but I always put it off. Elena does all the worrying. Blood pressure’s okay, I think… they check it at the pharmacy sometimes when I get my prescriptions, and they haven’t said anything. I have Medicare, so they probably would have told me if something was really bad.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No chronic conditions, blood pressure seems stable, and you have Medicare, which means regular check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. That’s about it. Nothing else. No broken bones, no major illnesses… just the usual bumps and bruises from work. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Elena says I'm too stubborn to stay in bed when I'm sick, that's why I haven't had more problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy long ago, otherwise no surgeries. And you’re a stubborn man who doesn’t like to stay in bed. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just one. For my arthritis. It's called… oh, let me see… Ibuprofen. Just when it gets really bad, you know? Not every day. And sometimes, a little something for my heartburn. Just an over-the-counter thing. Tums, I think it’s called. That's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ibuprofen for arthritis as needed and Tums for heartburn. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Elena always teases me about it. She says I have an iron stomach. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine the doctor ever gave me, and I haven't had any trouble with food allergies. She worries about everything though, so she always asks.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, last question regarding your history. Any family history of skin conditions, like psoriasis or eczema?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Not that I can recall. My mother had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains when she got older, but nothing on her skin that I remember. My father, he was a strong man, never got sick much. No, I don't think so. Nobody in my family had anything like these bumps on their legs, not that I know of. Elena might know more… she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of skin conditions that you’re aware of. Thank you for all that information, Clarke. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, these bumps are concerning for shin nodules, possibly due to stasis dermatitis or, less likely, other causes. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying conditions, and potentially a skin biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a skin biopsy? Hmm. Sounds serious. What does that even mean? I just want these bumps to go away, Doctor. Is it something bad? And will the biopsy hurt? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clarke. It doesn’t necessarily mean something bad, but it's important to get a clear understanding of what's causing these bumps. The blood work will check for things like inflammation and circulation issues. A skin biopsy involves taking a very small sample of the bump, sending it to the lab to look at under a microscope. It's a quick procedure. We would numb the area with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn’t feel much more than a slight pinch. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually well-tolerated. The reason I want to do these tests is to rule out anything serious, such as vasculitis or a more concerning skin condition. The blood work and biopsy will help us determine the best course of treatment. It’s better to be thorough, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Well... you're right. Better to be safe than sorry, I guess. Elena always says that too. Vasculi-what-is? That sounds scary. But if it's just a pinch… and it'll tell you what's wrong… Okay, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Blood work and the little pinch. Just… try to be quick, okay? And tell me what the results mean, in plain English. No medical talk, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clarke. I’ll explain everything in plain English. Vasculitis just means inflammation of the blood vessels. It’s not always serious, and the tests will help us determine if that’s what’s going on. I’ll get the orders for the blood work, and then we can schedule a time for the skin biopsy. It’ll only take a few minutes. The lab will analyze the sample, and it usually takes about a week to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest your legs and avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week? That's a long time to wait. Okay. No, I don't think so. Just… will it leave a scar? Elena always worries about scars. And… will it hurt a lot afterwards? Like, will I be able to walk? I have to get to work, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are good questions, Clarke. The biopsy site will likely leave a small mark, but usually it fades over time and is barely noticeable. We’ll use a small stitch to close it, and I’ll give you instructions on how to care for the wound to minimize scarring. As for pain afterwards, it’s usually mild. You may experience some soreness or discomfort for a few days, but over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen should be enough to manage it. You should be able to walk, but I recommend avoiding strenuous activity for a week or so to allow the area to heal properly. We’ll give you a bandage and instructions on how to keep it clean and dry. I’ll write up a detailed aftercare sheet for you. I want to reassure you that it’s a relatively simple procedure, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No... I think that's it for now. Just... a week. Alright. Tell me when to come back for the blood work, and we'll get this over with. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Clarke. I understand it’s not ideal to wait a week, but it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis. The lab technician will call you to schedule your blood work appointment. It can be done at any of the local Quest Diagnostics locations – I'll print you a list with addresses. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, please rest your legs, avoid strenuous activity, and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Here are the aftercare instructions for the biopsy, and the list of Quest Diagnostics locations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly, even the scary parts. I appreciate you taking the time. I guess... I'll see you in a week, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. It was my pleasure. I'll look forward to seeing you then. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes up before then. Take care, and have a good day. .
