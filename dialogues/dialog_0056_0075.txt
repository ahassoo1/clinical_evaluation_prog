DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I’m here because… honestly, I’ve been feeling awfully sleepy during the day. Even though I’m using a machine at night, the one for my sleep apnea, it doesn't seem to be helping as much as it should. It’s a bit frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling tired even with the CPAP machine is definitely frustrating. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. So, just to clarify, you're saying you're still experiencing daytime sleepiness despite using the machine consistently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Consistently is the right word. I use it every single night, like clockwork. I wouldn't skip it. But it’s just… I still find myself nodding off in my chair sometimes, or feeling very drowsy in the afternoons. It’s not a good feeling, and it makes it hard to concentrate on things. I used to be quite a sharp man, you know? Still am, I hope! But it’s getting harder.
DOCTOR: I hear you, and it's good that you're consistent with the CPAP. That’s a really important first step. Okay, so you feel like it should be helping more, and it’s impacting your ability to concentrate. When did you start noticing this daytime sleepiness, despite using the machine?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's been… oh, probably about six months now. I got the machine about a year and a half ago, and for the first six months or so, it was wonderful. A real lifesaver. Then gradually, the tiredness started creeping back in. Not right away, you understand. It was slow. But now, it’s definitely noticeable again. I remember thinking, “Oh, this isn’t right. It’s supposed to fix this!” Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it worked well initially and then the effectiveness decreased over time. Okay, let’s dig a little deeper. Aside from the sleepiness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… well, let me see. My wife, bless her soul – we’re divorced now, but we still speak – used to complain I snored, even with the machine on sometimes. She said it wasn't as loud, but still there. And… I’ve been waking up with a bit of a dry mouth most mornings, even though I’m trying to keep the humidifier on the machine filled. Nothing major, but it’s something. And I think… maybe a little bit more irritable than I used to be. But who knows, maybe that’s just old age!
DOCTOR: Okay, snoring despite the CPAP, dry mouth, and some increased irritability. Those are all helpful things to know. Just one quick question before we move on. When you say irritable, is that mostly first thing in the morning, or throughout the day?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I think it’s more throughout the day, honestly. Not a raging anger or anything, you understand. Just… a shorter fuse, I suppose. Little things bother me more easily than they used to. It’s hard to explain. I find myself snapping at people a bit, and then feeling bad about it afterwards. It’s a bit embarrassing, really. I never used to be like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more consistent irritability throughout the day. Thanks for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. And I had a bit of an issue with my heart a few years ago – they said it was atrial fibrillation, or something like that. I had a procedure to fix it, and it’s been alright since then. Other than that… not much, really. Just the usual aches and pains for an old man! I see my regular doctor for check-ups twice a year. And I'm on Medicare, so they keep a pretty good record of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, history of atrial fibrillation with a procedure, and you're on Medicare – that’s helpful. And you see your regular doctor regularly, great. Do you know the names and dosages of the medications you’re currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, I have them written down. Just a moment… Okay, here we go. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And Amlodipine, 5 milligrams, also once a day. I take them both in the morning with my breakfast. I try to be very good about remembering, you know? My doctor stressed how important they are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg and Amlodipine 5mg daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything in sight, really! My wife used to say I had a cast iron stomach. And I've never had a problem with pollen or anything like that either. I’m very lucky in that regard, I suppose. No allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that's good to know. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let me just ask one more question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, and it gave him terrible trouble. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those sorts of things. I was always a bit of a bookworm, you see. Preferred a good novel to a night out. I like to keep things simple and healthy, as much as I can at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Alright, Moshe, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your throat and ears. Just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go right ahead. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know! I've had a few over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which we already know about from your previous cardiac work-up. Your lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds bilaterally. And now let's just take a look at your throat… Your throat looks clear, no signs of infection. And your ears are also clear. Now, can you open your mouth wide and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Ahhhh… is that alright? I used to be able to say "Ah" very loudly when I was a boy scout! Not so much these days, I suppose. Is everything okay? I felt a little bit of pressure when you were looking at my throat, but nothing painful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, thank you. Everything looks fine, just a little bit of mild redness at the back of your throat, probably due to dryness. So, putting everything together - the ongoing daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, the slightly elevated blood pressure, the history of atrial fibrillation, and the findings from the exam – I think we need to investigate a few things further. It’s possible that your sleep apnea isn’t fully controlled, or that another factor is contributing to your fatigue. I'm going to order a sleep study to re-evaluate your CPAP settings, and I'd like to do some blood work to check your thyroid levels, iron levels, and a complete blood count. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I'd rather get to the bottom of it now than let it drag on. A sleep study and blood work… alright. Will I need to come back for another appointment to discuss the results? And will the insurance – Medicare, in my case – cover all of this? I always worry about those things, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. We’ll schedule that after we get the blood work and sleep study completed. As for Medicare, yes, they should cover both the sleep study and the blood work, assuming it’s deemed medically necessary, which I believe it is in your case. We’ll submit the necessary paperwork for you, but it’s always a good idea to double-check with your insurance provider directly if you have any concerns. Do you have any questions about the sleep study itself?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I had a sleep study done when they first diagnosed me with the apnea, so I know what to expect. It wasn't the most comfortable night, but I got through it. So, re-doing one shouldn’t be too bad. Will I be sleeping at the clinic again, or is there something different this time? And how long does it usually take to get the results back? I'm a bit impatient, I'm afraid! I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, good that you’re familiar with the process. This time, we’ll likely do a home sleep apnea test, so you’ll be able to sleep in your own bed. You’ll wear a small device that monitors your breathing while you sleep, and then return it to us the next day. As for the results, it usually takes about a week to get them back from the lab. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss everything. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A home sleep test is much more convenient. And a week isn’t too bad to wait. I’ll keep an eye on my symptoms and contact you if anything changes. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I appreciate your help. I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Moshe. I'm glad I could help. We'll get the orders for the home sleep apnea test and blood work sent over to the lab, and someone will contact you to schedule the tests. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
