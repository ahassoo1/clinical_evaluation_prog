DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been a bit of a worry, to be honest. And I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctor told me it was called… atrial… something? I just know it’s not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, let’s talk about both of those things. The swelling in your left leg first. Can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness around my ankle. But it’s gotten bigger each day, and now it’s up to my calf, you see? It’s a bit uncomfortable when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is there any pain with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not exactly pain, Doctor. More of a… heavy feeling? And it's a bit tender if I press on it. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And warmer than my other leg, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Warm to the touch is good to know. Have you noticed any redness or changes in the skin color on your left leg?
PATIENT: No, not that I've seen. It looks… normal, just bigger. No red patches or anything like that. I check it most days now, to be sure, but it still looks like my skin, just… stretched, I suppose. I haven't noticed any changes in color, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to your left leg recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I haven't fallen or bumped it or anything. I'm quite careful, usually. I’ve been walking about as normal, though maybe a bit slower with the swelling now. It just… appeared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, you also mentioned a funny heartbeat. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like it’s racing, sometimes. Like a fluttering in my chest. Other times it feels like it skips a beat. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it makes me feel a bit dizzy, and a bit short of breath. Not terribly bad, but enough to make me stop what I’m doing.
DOCTOR: You mentioned the doctor told you it was something with “atrial…” Was that an atrial fibrillation diagnosis, do you recall?
PATIENT: I think so, yes. That sounds right. He said something about the heart beating irregularly. He gave me a leaflet, but… I can’t quite recall everything he said. It was a few months ago, and I get a bit flustered when doctors talk to me quickly. I know I have to take it easy and watch for changes. But I don't remember exactly what he called it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medication for this irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. He said to keep an eye on it, and if it got worse, I should come back to see him. But it wasn’t bad enough to start anything, he said. I haven’t been back since, until today with this leg, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I want to examine your left leg to assess the swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need me to. Do I need to do anything? Take my shoes off, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could remove your shoes and socks, that would be great. And just lie back on the examination table. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Okay, Nixon. Your heart rate is a bit fast, around 98 beats per minute, and the rhythm is slightly irregular, as you described. Lung sounds are clear. Now, let's take a look at your leg. Your left leg does indeed have significant swelling compared to your right, extending from the ankle to the calf. It’s warm to the touch, and tender when I palpate it. I don’t feel any hard lumps or masses. I’m also going to measure the circumference of both legs to get a better idea of the difference in size. Okay. Your left leg is about 3 inches larger in circumference than your right leg at the widest point of the calf. This is concerning.
PATIENT: Oh my. Three inches! That is a lot, isn’t it? Is that… bad, Doctor? I was hoping it wasn't too serious. I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. What do you think is going on? Is it… connected to my heart?
DOCTOR: It is a significant amount of swelling, Nixon, and understandably concerning. It could be related to your heart condition, or it could be something else entirely. Given your history of atrial fibrillation and the sudden onset of swelling, we need to rule out a blood clot in your leg—what we call a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. That’s why the swelling is concerning. We’ll need to do some blood work and get an imaging test – most likely an ultrasound of your leg – to see if there's a clot present. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A clot… that sounds frightening, Doctor. I've never had one before. No, I don’t think I'm allergic to anything, no. I haven’t had many scans or anything, so I haven’t had any dye injected before. Just… routine blood tests, really. Is this a common thing with… this heart business? I hope it's not too serious. What happens if there is a clot?
DOCTOR: It's good that you haven’t had any reactions to dye before. As for whether it’s common, atrial fibrillation does increase the risk of blood clots, as the irregular heartbeat can cause blood to pool in the heart and form clots that can travel to other parts of the body. If a clot is present, we’ll need to start you on blood thinners – medication to prevent the clot from growing larger and to reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs, which can be very serious. We'd also want to figure out why the clot formed, and consider longer-term management options. Right now, we need to get that ultrasound done to confirm or rule out a clot. I'm going to order that for you right away. I will also order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out other possible causes of the swelling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. That’s… very thorough, thank you. An ultrasound and blood tests… that makes sense. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. I hope it’s not too long a wait for the ultrasound. I’m a bit nervous now, to be honest, but I’m glad we’re getting it checked out. Should I… cancel my plans for the next few days, in case I need to rest?
DOCTOR: You are right to want to be cautious. I'll try to get the ultrasound scheduled as quickly as possible – I'll have the receptionist prioritize it. We should know within 24-48 hours. And yes, it’s a good idea to cancel any strenuous plans for the next few days, just in case. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and try to elevate your leg as much as possible. I'm also going to give you a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for a more thorough evaluation of your atrial fibrillation. They can help determine the best long-term management plan for your heart condition. Here's the referral form for the cardiologist. I will also have the receptionist give you instructions on how to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, a cardiologist, yes, that sounds sensible. Thank you for thinking of that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I suppose… I just need to wait for the ultrasound results. I'm a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. Thank you very much for your help today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I understand your worry, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe leg pain – before your ultrasound appointment. We'll take it one step at a time. I'll see you back in the office once we have the results. Have a good day, and please take care.
