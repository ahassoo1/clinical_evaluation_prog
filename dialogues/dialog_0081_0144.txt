DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Paulino, you say? Hmm. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter scheduled this, you see. She worries so. Says I should just…get checked out. I feel fine, mostly. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age, I suppose. Though, I can’t rightly recall what she was so concerned about specifically. Is she here? Perhaps she explained it better to the nice lady at the front desk.
DOCTOR: I see. It's often the case that family members have specific concerns. While your daughter’s input is valuable, let’s focus on your health today. “Usual aches and pains” can still be important, and it’s good you’re here to discuss them. Do you have any specific areas that bother you more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, aches and pains… well, my knees, certainly. They’ve been acting up lately. Not constantly, you understand. More when the weather changes, I think. And my back… it’s just a general stiffness, really. I used to be so active, you know. Gardening, mostly. But that was… a long time ago. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. Don’t waste your time on it, dear.
DOCTOR: "Not waste my time?
PATIENT: Oh, don't misunderstand, Doctor. It’s just…I’ve been to doctors before, and they always seem to look at me like I’m made of glass. Always poking and prodding, asking a million questions. And then they tell me something I already know, like “you’re getting older.” It’s rather… tiresome, if you ask me. I just don’t want to take up your time with trivial matters. You have real patients, I’m sure, with real problems.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, every patient is a “real” patient, and your concerns are valid. It’s my job to listen and assess, regardless of age or perceived severity. Dismissing complaints simply because you are “getting older” would be poor medical practice, and frankly, disrespectful. Now, let’s focus on these knees and your back. When you say "acting up," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it that way... Alright. The knees… it's a sort of ache, deep down. Not a sharp pain, more of a…grinding sensation, I suppose. Especially when I try to stand up after sitting for a while. Or going down stairs. It's just unpleasant. And the back… it's a stiffness, like someone’s tightened a belt around me too tight. Not all the time, just… mornings mostly. It loosens up a bit as I move around. I don’t know if that makes any sense. Honestly, I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Grinding" and "tightness" are helpful descriptors. Do either of these symptoms radiate—meaning, does the pain or discomfort travel to other areas?
PATIENT: Radiate? Oh dear. You're using big words again, Doctor. Does it…spread? Like a cold? Hmm. I don't think so. No, it stays pretty much in the knees and back. Sometimes, maybe a little ache in my thighs with the knees, but not often. Mostly, it's just… there. Is that what you mean by… radiate? I really am terrible at this.
DOCTOR: Yes, "spread" is a good way to think of it. No, you're describing it perfectly well, Ms. Calvery. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the knee pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale. Numbers. Alright, alright… Hmm. Well, it’s never truly horrible, you understand. Like breaking a bone horrible. No. At its worst… maybe a four? Five, on a bad day. It's more of an annoyance, really. I can usually manage with it. Though, sometimes I have to take it slow. And the back… that’s usually less. A two or three, maybe? Honestly, it’s hard to say. I’m not one for complaining, so I don’t really pay attention to it unless it’s truly bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, a four to five for the knees and two to three for the back at their worst. And mostly an annoyance. Have you tried anything to alleviate these symptoms—over-the-counter medications, heat or cold packs, any specific exercises or stretches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my daughter is always telling me things to try. She's a very… practical girl. She got me some of those… what are they called… creams? Rubbing creams. With menthol, I think. They smell nice, but I’m not sure they actually do anything. I’ve tried them a few times. And I used to do some stretching, years ago, but I’ve fallen out of the habit. Honestly, it's just easier to… take it slow. And avoid doing things that bother me. I'm not a fan of all those exercises, too much effort.
DOCTOR: So the creams offer minimal relief, and you've discontinued regular exercise. I see. Now, just to get a better overall picture, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about…history? Well, let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, that was… oh, goodness, must have been thirty years ago. And I had a bit of a problem with my blood pressure a while back, but it’s been under control with… a little pill. A white pill. I can’t remember the name of it. And I’ve had the usual… arthritis, I suppose. What do they call it… osteoarthritis. Yes, that’s it. But nothing major. Honestly, I try not to dwell on it. It's all just part of getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy thirty years ago, history of hypertension managed with medication—we’ll need to verify the specific medication—and osteoarthritis. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar problems, such as arthritis or hypertension?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My mother had some aches and pains, I remember that. Mostly in her hands. Arthritis, I think. And my father… he had a bit of a heart problem towards the end. High blood pressure, maybe? It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don't remember much. We weren't very close, you see. He was a… difficult man. And I don't really have many other relatives left. Just my daughter, and she's very healthy, thankfully. So, not much help there, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of arthritis in your mother and hypertension in your father. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a calcium tablet sometimes, for my bones. My daughter reminds me. And a multivitamin, now and then. But I’m not very good at keeping track of things, you see. It depends. If I remember. Mostly I just take what my daughter tells me to. She’s very organized, thankfully. I'm hopeless with all of that. Don’t think there's anything else. Perhaps some cough drops, if I have a cold. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. We’ve covered quite a bit. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination of your knees and back, if you're comfortable with that. This will help me assess the range of motion and identify any areas of tenderness or swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination? Well... I suppose. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary... alright. But be gentle, please. And don’t take too long. I have a luncheon with my friend Eunice later, you see. She makes a lovely cucumber salad. But yes, go ahead. Just...be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. Now, if you could just sit here on the examination table, and I’ll start with your knees. First, I'll just have you extend your legs out straight. Okay. A little tenderness here, on the inner aspect of the right knee. And there's some crepitus – a grating sensation – when you bend and straighten it. Range of motion is slightly limited. Similar findings on the left, though slightly less pronounced. Some tenderness on the inner aspect, and crepitus with movement. Range of motion also slightly limited, but not as restricted as the right. And now, your back. Some muscle stiffness, as you described. Tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine. Range of motion is limited, particularly with bending forward and twisting. No radicular pain – meaning, no pain radiating down your legs. Alright, Ms. Calvery. I’ve completed the examination. Findings are consistent with osteoarthritis in both knees and lumbar spine.
PATIENT: Oh. Osteoarthritis. That sounds…serious. Is that what my daughter was worried about? Is it…bad? Will I need surgery? Honestly, I knew I shouldn’t have come. I told you I was fine! Now I’m just going to worry about it all day. And Eunice will think I’m being strange if I can’t enjoy her lovely cucumber salad.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, please don't worry. While osteoarthritis is a chronic condition, it’s often manageable with conservative treatment. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need surgery. In fact, most patients don't require surgical intervention. Your examination findings suggest mild to moderate osteoarthritis in both your knees and lower back. The tenderness and limited range of motion are consistent with the condition. Now, we can start with some simple measures—physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your knees and back, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and weight management if appropriate. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications to reduce stress on your joints. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Physical therapy… that sounds… tiring. And ibuprofen? Doesn't that upset your stomach? Honestly, all of this sounds like a lot of work. I just want to be able to walk without aching, you see. And enjoy Eunice’s cucumber salad! Is there… a pill for all of this? Something simple? My daughter said something about injections once. Would that work? Perhaps that’s less… bothersome than physical therapy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your desire for a simple solution. And yes, there are medications that can help manage the pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis. However, they often come with side effects, and long-term use is not always ideal. As for injections, corticosteroid injections can provide temporary relief by reducing inflammation in the joints. However, they are not a cure, and repeated injections can have potential side effects. They also don’t address the underlying cause of the osteoarthritis. Before we consider injections or long-term medication, I recommend we start with a trial of physical therapy. It can help strengthen the muscles around your joints, improve your range of motion, and reduce pain. We can also discuss over-the-counter pain relievers and strategies to manage your pain without medication. Would you be open to trying physical therapy for a few weeks to see if it helps?
PATIENT: Oh. A few weeks… Well, I suppose. If it’s just for a few weeks. But I don’t want to spend all day in a gym, you understand. And I don’t want to do anything too strenuous. My knees ache just thinking about it. And what if it doesn’t work? Then I’m just tired and aching. I don’t like being put through all of this, honestly. Is there a good therapist nearby? And can they come to me? I really don’t want to drive all over town. This is such a bother.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns and frustrations. We will find a physical therapist who can accommodate your needs and limitations. I can provide you with a referral to a therapist who offers in-home visits. They can assess your condition and develop a customized treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs and abilities. I'm looking up some therapists now who service your area and offer in-home appointments. Here, Dr. Lee's practice is quite close and has excellent reviews. They specialize in geriatric physical therapy, and their therapists are experienced in treating osteoarthritis. Here is the contact information for Dr. Lee's practice. You can schedule an initial consultation to discuss your concerns and determine if physical therapy is right for you. If, after a few weeks of physical therapy, you are not experiencing any improvement, we can discuss other options, such as injections or medication. But I encourage you to give physical therapy a try first. It often provides significant relief for patients with osteoarthritis. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh. Dr. Lee… geriatric physical therapy. That sounds… less strenuous, I suppose. In-home visits are good, yes, very good. I really don't want to drive. Alright, I’ll give them a call. But I'm not making any promises, you understand. If it’s too much work, I’ll just stop. And what about Eunice? I don't want to cancel my luncheon. Cucumber salad is very important. I suppose I can try. But if my knees ache, I'm blaming you, Doctor. Absolutely blaming you. Is there anything else I need to know? Or can I finally go enjoy my day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. No, I don’t believe there is anything else at this time. I’ve provided you with a referral to Dr. Lee’s practice, and I encourage you to schedule an initial consultation as soon as possible. Please be sure to inform Dr. Lee about your concerns and limitations. And, of course, listen to your body. If you experience any pain or discomfort during physical therapy, stop and rest. I understand your desire to enjoy your luncheon with Eunice, and I hope you are able to do so without any discomfort. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. And, please, enjoy your day.
