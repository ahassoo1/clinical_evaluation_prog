DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Benic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye, Dr. Kamahele. Lovely to meet ye as well. Well, it’s this mornin’ sickness, really. Been happenin’ for a wee while now, and I’m a bit worried 'cause o’ me heart, ye see. It just… comes on strong when I wake up. Not every day, mind ye, but enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Mornin’ sickness, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Though, I’m a 63-year-old man, Dr. Kamahele! Not expectin’ any bairns, ye ken? It's just… feelin' queasy and sick to me stomach first thing. It’s been a bit worse lately, and with me heart condition… well, it has me a wee bit spooked. The doctor a few years back said somethin’ about fluid build-up, I think. Does that make sense? I’m terrible at rememberin’ details sometimes, even though I usually can recall most things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Benic. And don't worry about remembering details – that’s what I’m here for! We’ll sort through everything together. So, to clarify, you’re experiencing nausea and vomiting, particularly in the mornings, and you're concerned about how this might relate to your heart condition and potential fluid build-up?
PATIENT: Aye, that's spot on, Doctor. Nausea mostly, to be fair. Haven’t actually been sick, just feelin’ right awful and like I might be. And yes, the fluid... the doctor said somethin’ 'bout me feet swellin’ up if it got too bad. They haven’t been too bad lately, but the sickness has me thinkin' it might all be connected. It's just… a worry, ye ken?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry completely. It’s good you’re paying attention to any changes and that you remember your feet swelling. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, can you tell me roughly how long this nausea has been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, I'd say, maybe... six weeks ago? Around the end of June, I reckon. It was just now and then at first, a bit of a queasy feelin'. But it’s become more frequent, and stronger, over the past two weeks or so. It's not every mornin’, mind ye, but maybe three or four times a week now. And it lingers a bit longer each time. It's just enough to ruin me breakfast, ye see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six weeks, starting at the end of June, and getting progressively worse over the last two weeks, with nausea occurring about three to four times a week. And it’s affecting your appetite. Now, besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Ruinin' me breakfast is a shame, I tell ye. . Well... now that ye mention it, I've been a wee bit more tired than usual. Just feelin’ a bit… drained, like. And me breath's been a bit short, but I always put that down to the heart, ye ken? It gets worse when I’m walkin’ up the hill to the shops, o’ course. And… oh, I've been feelin' a bit of a heaviness in me chest, sometimes. Not pain, exactly, just… heavy. It comes and goes, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, shortness of breath, and a feeling of heaviness in your chest, alongside the nausea. And the shortness of breath and chest heaviness are related to exertion. Now, have you had any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Comes and goes, it does. Now, weight… hmm. I haven’t been weighin’ meself regularly, to be honest. But I think… I think I might’ve put on a pound or two, maybe three, in the last month. Not much, but I noticed me trousers feelin’ a bit tighter around the waist. And me ankles… they've been a wee bit puffy some days, but not too bad. It's hard to say for sure, mind ye. I'm not one for watchin’ the scales, ye ken. Prefer a good meal to worryin' about a number!
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Benic. It’s good you’re aware of the changes, even if you haven’t been formally weighing yourself. It sounds like you’ve noticed some weight gain and ankle swelling. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you mind telling me what conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, no bother at all. Let me see… the main thing is me heart, o’ course. I’ve got somethin’ called… congestive heart failure, I think that’s what the doctor said. It was a few years ago now, maybe five or six. I'm on some tablets for it, aye. And… oh, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it seems to be under control now with the same tablets, I believe. I had a bit of arthritis in me knees, but that's just an old man's ailment, ye ken? Apart from that, not much. I've been a pretty healthy lad all me life, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so congestive heart failure, hypertension – which is currently controlled with medication – and arthritis. Do you remember what medications you’re currently taking for your heart and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think… the heart tablet… it's a wee white one, I think. Starts with an 'A', maybe Amlodipine? And the blood pressure one… it's a pink one. Losartan, that's it! Yes, Losartan. I take one of each every mornin’ with me breakfast, unless I'm feelin’ queasy, o’ course. Then I leave them be for a wee while.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine and Losartan, one of each daily. And you sometimes skip them if you’re feeling nauseous. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than your heart condition?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Not often missin' them, but when I'm feelin' awful, I just can't face it. Let me see… no surgeries, no. Never had to go under the knife, thank goodness. Been hospitalized a couple o’ times for me heart, aye. A few years back when they first diagnosed it, I was in for a week or so to get it sorted. And… oh, I had me appendix out when I was a lad, maybe 50 years ago now. Apart from that, not much. Just the usual scrapes and bruises, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Okay, hospitalizations for your heart condition and an appendectomy many years ago. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Old age takes it toll, ye see. Let me think… me father had a bad heart, aye. He died when he was in his 70s, somethin' to do with heart failure, I think. And me mother… she had diabetes, aye. And high blood pressure, too. And me sister… she had arthritis, like me. So, heart problems, diabetes, and arthritis seem to run in the family. Apart from that, not much. We were a pretty hardy bunch, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Family's important. No, I don't smoke, never have. Tried it once when I was a lad, didn't like it. And I don't use any recreational drugs, not me. I used to enjoy a wee dram of whisky now and then, aye. But I haven't had one in a while now, maybe a few months. Doesn't agree with me heart, ye see. And I don’t drink alcohol often, maybe a glass of wine with me dinner now and then, but not regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or drug use, and occasional alcohol consumption. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. It’s good to be careful. No, I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. And I’m not allergic to anything else either, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I enjoy a good meal, ye see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. That’s very helpful. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing nausea for about six weeks, which is worsening, and you're concerned about how it relates to your heart condition. You also mentioned fatigue, shortness of breath, chest heaviness, some weight gain, and ankle swelling. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, feel your abdomen, and examine your ankles and legs. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Glad to help in any way I can. I trust yer judgement, o’ course. Go right ahead, do what ye need to do. I’m used to the doctor checkin’ me over, given me heart.
DOCTOR: “Your heart sounds… a little bit muffled, and I can hear some crackling in your lungs, particularly towards the base of your right lung. That could indicate some fluid build-up.” “Your blood pressure is slightly elevated today – 150/90. We’ll need to keep an eye on that.” “Your abdomen is soft, but there’s a little bit of tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing too concerning at the moment.” “And as you mentioned, there is some mild swelling in your ankles. Let me just check your reflexes…” “Okay. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems consistent with your history, but the crackling in your lungs and elevated blood pressure are things we’ll want to investigate further.”
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds… a bit worrying, to be honest. Cracklin’ in me lungs… that doesn’t sound good. And me blood pressure bein’ up… I always try to watch me salt intake, but it’s easy to get carried away, ye ken? I do enjoy a good meal. What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it me heart gettin’ worse? Is that why I'm feelin' so queasy?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Benic, and it’s good that you’re taking it seriously. The crackling in your lungs suggests there is some fluid build-up, which can happen with congestive heart failure. It doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is getting significantly worse immediately, but it does mean we need to address it. Your elevated blood pressure could be contributing to the fluid build-up and could also be a factor in your nausea. As for the nausea itself, it’s difficult to say definitively whether it’s directly related to your heart condition or something else. Nausea can have many causes, even unrelated to the heart. It could be a side effect of your medications, a stomach bug, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to rule out any infection. Second, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And third, a chest X-ray to confirm the fluid build-up in your lungs and assess the size of your heart. I'd also like to order an ECG to evaluate the electrical activity of your heart. Would you be able to get these tests done at the clinic?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Best to know for sure, ye ken? I’m happy to get the tests done here at the clinic, if that’s alright. I trust yer judgement. Will it be a long process? And how long will it take to get the results back? I’ve got a bit of a schedule, ye see, and I'm tryin’ to get meself up to the shops for me weekly supplies.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Benic. I’m glad you’re willing to proceed with the tests. It shouldn’t be a long process. The blood tests are relatively quick, and the chest X-ray will take only a few minutes. The ECG is also a fairly straightforward procedure. The phlebotomist is just down the hall and can get you started right away. Once the tests are completed, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. In the meantime, I'll prescribe you a mild anti-nausea medication to help manage your symptoms. I'd also recommend reducing your salt intake as much as possible, and staying well-hydrated. Once I have the test results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan tailored to your needs. If the results indicate a worsening of your heart condition, we may need to adjust your medications or consider other treatment options. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Anti-nausea medication sounds good, and I'll definitely cut back on the salt. I've got a good water bottle I can keep with me. So, just get the blood tests and the chest X-ray done, then wait for the results? And we'll talk about them in a couple o’ days? Thank ye kindly for explainin’ everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts me mind at ease a bit, knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Yes, that's correct. Just the blood tests and chest X-ray for now, and we'll discuss the results in a couple of days. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the blood tests. She'll then direct you to the radiology department for the chest X-ray. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe nausea. Here’s the prescription for the anti-nausea medication. And a leaflet about reducing salt intake. Let me know if you have any questions before you go.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I've got all that sorted. No questions at the moment, but I'll be sure to call if anythin’ changes. I appreciate yer time and yer patience. Ye've put me mind at ease, and that's worth more than anythin’. I'll be off then, and get meself down to the shops. Thank ye again!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. Take care, and have a good day. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
