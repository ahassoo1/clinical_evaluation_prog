DOCTOR: Right. Bianca Zicarelli, 63 years old. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just… I does be feeling real thirsty all the time. And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. Is very strange, you know?
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, even after eating… alright. And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Is start maybe… two, three months now? Is not sudden like, one day I just feel it. Is come on slow, slow. At first, I think is just the heat, you know? Is been real warm lately. But is still happening now, even when is not so hot.
DOCTOR: Two or three months… gradually worsening. And besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… well, I does be going to the bathroom more often, yes. To pee. Is not painful or anything, just… more times in the day. And sometimes I feel a little tired, but I does work hard, so I thought is just that. Is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Increased urination and some fatigue. Okay. And when you say "more often," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… well, before, I used to go maybe three, four times a day. Now? Is like… every couple hours. Sometimes even more if I drink a lot of water, trying to get rid of this thirst. Is interfering with my work, you know? I have to keep stopping.
DOCTOR: Every couple of hours… alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? No, not that I notice. I does wear glasses, you know, for reading and such. But is the same as always. Maybe a little blurry if I don't have them on, but that is normal. Is not getting worse or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… that is a good question. I don't think so. Maybe a little, but I does work hard in the sun, so I thought is just me losing weight from the heat. I haven't been trying to lose weight, you know? My husband does say I should eat more, but is hard when I feeling so thirsty all the time. Is filling up on water!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I does go to the doctor sometimes for check-ups, but they never tell me I have anything serious. Just the usual things, you know? A little high cholesterol, but nothing to worry about too much, they say. I try to eat healthy when I can, but is hard with the price of food these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnosis of diabetes or hypertension. Just some elevated cholesterol. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… years ago, I had my appendix taken out. That was a long time ago, when I was a young woman. And I had a baby, two times! But that is not really a surgery, is it? Nothing else, Doctor. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. I does try to stay healthy, you know? I don’t like going to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy years ago, two pregnancies. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. I does try to avoid them if I can. I does take a little vitamin C sometimes, when I feeling a cold coming on, but that is all. Nothing regular. I believe in natural remedies, you know? My grandmother taught me a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she had some problems with her sugar, yes. The doctor told her she had the sugar sickness, but I don’t know much about it. She passed away years ago. And my father, he had high blood pressure, I think. But they didn't have good doctors back then, you know? It was a long time ago. Not much else I can tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work, Doctor. I operate pumps for the water company. Is hard work, out in the sun all day. I does try to drink plenty of water, like I say, to stay hydrated. I live with my husband, and we try to eat healthy when we can afford it. Is not much else to it, really. A simple life. I don't smoke or drink.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’ll do a quick blood sugar test as well. That's just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Is just… I does be worried about this thirst, you know? Is not normal for me. So, anything you can do to find out what is happening, I appreciate it. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, I'll take your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Alright, just a quick prick… Your blood sugar is 210 milligrams per deciliter. That's higher than normal. We need to discuss these results.
PATIENT: 210? Is that bad, Doctor? Is that why I does be so thirsty? I don't understand. What does that mean? Is it serious? I never had problems with sugar before… My mother, she used to say… but I don’t know. I getting scared now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, let's take a deep breath. A blood sugar of 210 is significantly elevated. A normal fasting blood sugar is usually between 70 and 100 milligrams per deciliter. The fact that yours is 210 suggests that you may have diabetes. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean you definitely have diabetes, but it's a strong indicator. The thirst and frequent urination you’re experiencing are common symptoms of high blood sugar. Your body is trying to get rid of the excess sugar through your urine, which leads to dehydration and, consequently, thirst. We need to run some further tests to confirm this diagnosis. I want to order a Hemoglobin A1c test. This test gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. It's a more accurate picture than a single blood sugar reading. And I’d also like to do a fasting blood sugar test tomorrow morning, just to confirm today’s result. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Yes, Doctor, alright. If you think is best. I just… what does this mean for me? Will I be sick? Will I need… needles? My mother, she used to get injections. Is that what happens? I getting worried about everything. Can you explain it to me, slowly? I don't understand all these big words. What happens if I do have… this sugar sickness?
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, let's take it one step at a time. First, don’t panic. A diagnosis of diabetes isn’t the end of the world. It just means your body isn't processing sugar properly. There are different types of diabetes. We’ll figure out which one you have once we get the results of the tests. As for what happens if you do have diabetes… it’s manageable. The goal is to keep your blood sugar levels under control. This can often be done with lifestyle changes – diet and exercise. Many people with type 2 diabetes can manage their condition this way, without medication. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, we may consider medication. And yes, sometimes that involves injections. But the needles are very small, and the technology has improved a lot. It's not like it used to be. We will cross that bridge when and if we need to. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to complications, like heart problems, kidney problems, and nerve damage. But that’s why it’s important to get diagnosed and treated. We want to prevent those complications. We will work together. I will explain everything to you, every step of the way. We will have a plan. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That… that sounds better. Working together. Yes, I like that. I don't want to end up like my mother, you know? Always sick. So, tests first. What do I have to do for these tests? Do I have to fast? Is it expensive? I don't have much money, you see. And can you explain this… Hemoglobin A1c thing to me in simple words? I promise I trying to understand, but these big words… they confuse me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, you’re doing great. It’s perfectly okay to ask questions. Let’s start with the tests. For the Hemoglobin A1c test, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. It's best to schedule it first thing in the morning. As for the fasting blood sugar test tomorrow, you'll also need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. We can do both tests at the same time if you prefer. Now, about the cost… I understand your concern. The cost of the tests can vary. I’ll have my staff check with the lab for the exact prices, and we can explore options for financial assistance or payment plans if needed. I can also write a referral to a free clinic, if that would be helpful. We will figure something out. Don’t worry about that right now. Now, the Hemoglobin A1c test… think of it like this: your blood sugar levels go up and down throughout the day, depending on what you eat. The A1c test tells us the average sugar level over the past few months. It’s like taking a picture of your sugar control over time. It's more accurate than just one single blood sugar reading. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes a little more sense. Like a picture. A picture of my sugar. And no food for eight hours. I can do that. I can wake up early. And you will help me with the cost? That is a big relief. I been worried about that all morning. So, tomorrow morning, no food, and then I come here for these tests? Is there anything else I need to do? Should I stop drinking juice? I like my juice in the morning… Is that bad? I just… I want to be prepared, you know? I don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Tomorrow morning, no food, and come here for the tests. And yes, it’s best to avoid sugary drinks like juice for now. It will give us a more accurate reading. Water is fine. You're doing a great job, Bianca, you're asking all the right questions. For now, try not to stress too much. Just focus on drinking water and getting a good night’s sleep. We will go from there. My staff will schedule the tests for you, and they will give you detailed instructions. I’m going to write a referral for a basic metabolic panel and a comprehensive lipid panel as well, just to get a broader picture of your overall health. And finally, I’m going to give you a handout with information about diabetes and healthy eating. It can be a little overwhelming, but don’t feel like you need to read it all at once. Just take your time. We will work through this together, Bianca. I have confidence we will get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all for now. You explained everything very clearly. And you are very kind. I been worried sick, but I feel a little better now. Knowing that you will help me, and that you won't let me mess it up… that means a lot. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. For everything. I will see you tomorrow morning, then. And I will remember, no food. And lots of water. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. And you remember everything perfectly. Yes, no food, lots of water. We’ll get those tests done tomorrow and go from there. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, Bianca. I’ll see you tomorrow morning.
