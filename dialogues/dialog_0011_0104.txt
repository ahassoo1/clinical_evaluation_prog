DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, if we could just get on with it… my throat. It hurts. Very annoying, really. I need to be quick, I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand your time is valuable. “Very annoying” is a good start, but could you describe the pain a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? What do you mean specifically? It hurts when I… swallow. And talk. Like now. It’s just… painful. Is that specific enough? I don’t have time for a whole… investigation of it.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was unclear. It simply helps me to understand the nature of the discomfort. When did this throat pain begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin… Honestly, I haven’t the faintest. A few days, maybe? Last week, possibly? It all feels like one long, irritating blur, to be truthful. It doesn’t matter when it started, Doctor, it matters that it is hurting now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. Even a vague timeline can be helpful. So, within the last week, the pain has been present consistently?
PATIENT: Consistently… mostly. It comes and goes, naturally. Worse when I have to… use my voice. My job requires a lot of… speaking. And now this. It’s just… inconvenient. Really, very inconvenient. Is there anything you can do about it, or are we just going to discuss it all afternoon?
DOCTOR: Alright. And on a scale of one to ten, with one being hardly noticeable and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you assign to the pain at its most intense?
PATIENT: A scale? Honestly. Well… maybe a seven? On a bad day. When I’m actually trying to work. It’s… distracting. I wouldn’t say unbearable, but… unpleasant. A seven seems fair. Though frankly, I think a good night's sleep would fix everything, if I had the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Ottaviani. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the throat pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? A fever? No. A cough? No. I’m not… ill. Just a sore throat. It’s probably just…tiredness. I work very hard, you know. This whole…situation is quite stressful. Is this going anywhere, Doctor? I really must get back.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Ottaviani. Just a few more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing, or any swelling in your neck?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Doctor, are you suggesting I'm…dying? Really! No, I can breathe perfectly well. And no swelling. I would know if there was swelling! I keep myself well-presented. This is all rather… unnecessary. Are we finished now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. It’s good to rule those things out. Now, have you been exposed to anyone recently who has been sick with a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Exposed? Doctor, I work with…people. All the time. Of course I’ve been exposed to sick people! It's inevitable. They're always coughing and sneezing. Honestly, it’s a wonder I haven't caught everything. It doesn't matter who was sick, it matters that I am experiencing this…inconvenience. Can we please move on to…a solution?
DOCTOR: Very well. I'd like to briefly examine your throat, if that’s acceptable. It will help me to assess the situation more thoroughly. Could you please open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Honestly, Doctor, you’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It’s just a sore throat! I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Your throat is mildly red, and I don't feel any swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief examination, it appears you likely have a mild viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t take…things. I prefer to deal with things myself. Honestly, Doctor, if it’s just a…virus, can’t I just rest and…drink tea? That’s what my mother always did. I really haven’t the time for complicated remedies. Are you going to prescribe me something, or are we just going to keep talking about it?
DOCTOR: Rest and fluids are certainly helpful, Ms. Ottaviani. As this appears to be a mild viral infection, antibiotics wouldn’t be beneficial and are not recommended. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the discomfort. Lozenges and warm salt water gargles may also provide relief. I’m going to document these recommendations in your chart. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Salt water gargles… honestly. Very well. I suppose that’s… acceptable. No, I don't have any questions. Just… write it down and let me leave. I have things to do. And please, no further…investigations. This has taken long enough. Are we finished now? Finally?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, we are finished. Here’s a summary of the recommendations, including the over-the-counter options and self-care measures we discussed. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a week, please schedule another appointment, or seek medical attention. Do you require a work note?
PATIENT: A work note? No. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own… affairs. Thank you, Doctor. Though frankly, this whole experience has been… a waste of time. Good day.
