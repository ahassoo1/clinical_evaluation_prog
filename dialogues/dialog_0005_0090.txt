DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe it’s a… clearance appointment? To make sure I’m healthy enough, that is. Honestly, the details are a little fuzzy. It's been a difficult time, and appointments… they all sort of blend together.
DOCTOR: A surgery, right. Okay. Well, let's try to sort it out. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit muddled; we'll get to the bottom of it. First, what kind of surgery are you scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that is a good question. It’s… for cosmetic reasons. Something I’ve wanted for a long time. I think it has to do with… my face? Perhaps? It’s a bit embarrassing to admit I don't recall precisely. My husband… he was the one who really researched everything. And now… well. I'm trying to piece things back together.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cosmetic surgery. It's not embarrassing at all to not remember specifics, especially with everything you’ve been through. Do you recall where on your face the surgery is planned?
PATIENT: I… believe it was around my eyes? Something about… sagging? Or wrinkles? It’s terribly vague, I apologize. He mentioned something about making me look more… refreshed, I think. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I was just trusting his judgment then. I wasn't really focusing on the details, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Okay, so a facial procedure around the eyes. Eyelid surgery, perhaps?
PATIENT: Possibly? That sounds right, actually. Eyelid surgery… yes, that rings a bell. My husband… he showed me some pictures, before and after examples. I think it was to lift them, make them look less… tired. Is that what it’s called? Lifting? I truly am sorry for not being more helpful. I just… feel like a lot of it is lost to me.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Brightful. We'll get there. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think I’m generally healthy. My husband always made sure I went for check-ups. I don't recall any major diagnoses. He was very diligent about my health. Oh! He did mention something about my cholesterol being a little high once, a few years back. But I think it was managed with diet. I haven’t been to a doctor since… well, since he passed. I’m not sure if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, potentially elevated cholesterol. And you haven't been to a doctor since your husband’s passing. Right. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Not regularly, anyway. He sometimes gave me something for headaches, if they were particularly bad, but… it was nothing consistent. Just over-the-counter things, I believe. I haven't needed anything for a while now. It's mostly just… trying to get through each day, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I don't recall ever having a reaction to anything. My husband used to joke that I could eat anything without consequence. He always worried about me, you see. About all sorts of things. It’s difficult… remembering these details without him.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's move on to your surgical history. Aside from this upcoming procedure, have you ever had any other surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I remember that vividly. And… oh! I broke my wrist once, when I was younger. It required a cast. But other than that, I don’t believe so. No major surgeries. Nothing… elective, like this one. It's been a fairly uncomplicated medical history, thankfully. Is that a good thing?
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… that’s a difficult one. My family is… large. And spread out. I don’t know a lot about their medical histories, honestly. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… she had something with her heart, but I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s just… I wasn’t very close to most of my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. Never. My husband… he didn't approve of any of that. And honestly, I don't have any interest. I prefer a quiet life. Just gardening, mostly. It’s… therapeutic. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s it. A very small glass. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to step on the scale and we'll check your blood pressure and pulse. I’ll also need to listen to your heart and lungs. Just routine, Ms. Brightful. Standard procedure before any surgery, even cosmetic ones.
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I understand. It’s… good to be thorough, I suppose. Just let me know if there’s anything else I can do to help. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Please, step onto the scale first. And then we’ll move over to the examination table. Just take your time.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Is there anything I should be doing? Breathing a certain way? I just want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Just stand still, Ms. Brightful. Relax. No need to do anything special. 93 kilograms… Alright. Now, if you’ll follow me to the examination table. We'll check your vital signs there.
PATIENT: Oh. Is… is that a lot? I haven't weighed myself in a very long time. My husband… he always discouraged me from focusing on numbers. I just want to make sure I’m healthy enough for the surgery, that’s all.
DOCTOR: It's a number. We'll assess your overall health, Ms. Brightful. Don't focus on one thing. Now, please have a seat. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath in… Is that okay? I sometimes feel a little… short of breath when I’m anxious. It’s probably nothing. Just… a little nervous about everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Your breathing is slightly labored, Ms. Brightful. And your heart rate is a little elevated. Heart sounds regular, but slightly distant. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, but mild wheezing on expiration. We’ll need to investigate this further. Before we proceed with any surgery, we need to rule out any underlying respiratory or cardiovascular issues. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And I’m referring you to a cardiologist for a full evaluation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A cardiologist? And an X-ray? Is… is something wrong? I thought I was healthy. My husband… he always made sure I was healthy. Does this mean I can't have the surgery? I've been waiting for so long… It’s very important to me.
DOCTOR: It means we need to be certain you’re healthy enough for any procedure, Ms. Brightful. It’s irresponsible to proceed without a proper assessment. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't have it, but we need to rule out potential risks first. We'll schedule the tests immediately. I'll have my nurse draw some blood as well, just to get a baseline. I'll also need a detailed list of any medications you’ve taken in the past six months, even over-the-counter ones. And please, think carefully. We need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Alright. Medications… It’s been so long. My husband handled most of that. I remember the tonsil medicine when I was a child, and something for a broken wrist… and maybe a headache pill occasionally. But… that's about it. I’ll try to remember anything else. It’s just… it’s all a bit blurry. I just want to feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can, Ms. Brightful. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll have the orders for the X-ray and EKG sent to the radiology department. You’ll receive a call to schedule those appointments. For now, just try to relax and focus on getting some rest. I'll see you back in the office once we have the test results. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I hope everything is okay.
