DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I… well, I’m here because of the cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay. That sounds concerning, Chellsea. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um… it was my husband’s, actually. He passed away a few months ago because of it. And now… I’ve been feeling very tired lately, and I found a lump. It’s… it’s on my neck, I think. I don’t… I don't know much about it, to be honest. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be very frightening, Chellsea, especially with your husband's recent passing. It's good you came in to get this checked out. We’ll figure out what’s going on. First, let’s talk about the fatigue. When did you start feeling tired?
PATIENT: It… it started maybe a month ago? It’s just… more than usual tiredness. Like, I can sleep all night and still feel like I haven’t rested. And it’s getting worse, I think. It’s hard to… to do things, even things I used to do easily.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned a lump on your neck. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not very big, maybe the size of a bean? It feels… hard, and it doesn’t really hurt, but it’s just… there. I noticed it a week ago, I think, when I was washing my hair. I haven’t really touched it much since, I was afraid to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly on your neck is this lump located?
PATIENT: Um… on the right side, a little bit below my ear. It’s… kind of hidden in the folds of my neck, I guess. I can show you, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see it. It does feel firm. Just to get a better understanding, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I haven't had a fever or anything. I’ve been losing my appetite a little bit, but I thought that was just from being… sad, you know? And I’ve been sweating a bit more at night, but it’s been very hot lately. So I wasn’t sure if that counted.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It’s good you're telling me everything, even things that seem small. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: I… I think I have lost a little bit of weight, but I haven’t really been keeping track. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? It’s hard to say for sure. I haven't been eating much, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t really have much of one. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but that was all. I go to the doctor for check-ups every year, but everything was always okay.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never had to have surgery. And I’ve only been to the hospital once, when I broke my arm when I was a little girl.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my husband’s mother had breast cancer, I think. And his grandfather… he had something, but I don’t remember what. On my side… my grandmother had diabetes, but that’s all I really know. It wasn't a big thing when she was alive.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Not anything at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also examine your neck more closely. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I’m feeling your neck now. I do feel a slightly enlarged lymph node on the right side, as you mentioned. It's firm and doesn't seem particularly tender to the touch. I’m also palpating the other lymph nodes in your neck to check for any other abnormalities. I don't feel any other significantly enlarged nodes at this time. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of an infection or, less commonly, something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially an imaging scan of your neck. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… a scan? What kind of scan? And… what are the blood tests for? Is it… is it cancer?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Chellsea. It’s natural to be worried. The blood tests will help us check for signs of infection, inflammation, and overall health. They can also give us some clues about whether something more serious might be going on. The scan I’m thinking of is a CT scan of your neck. It's a painless imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of the structures in your neck, including the lymph nodes, thyroid, and other tissues. It will help us see the size and location of the lump more clearly, and if there are any other abnormalities we need to investigate. I want to be very clear: the lump could be due to many things, most of which are not cancer. But given your history, and the fact that you’re experiencing fatigue, it’s important to rule out all possibilities. The tests will help us do that. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: A CT scan… okay. So, it doesn’t mean it’s cancer, you’re just… checking? And the blood tests will tell you about infection?
DOCTOR: Exactly. That's right. It doesn't mean it's cancer. Think of it as gathering information. We're being thorough, especially given your husband's recent passing. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of what’s going on in your neck, and the blood tests will help us look for any signs of infection or other problems. We'll look at the results together, and then we can discuss the best course of action. It's possible the lump is just a swollen lymph node from a minor infection, and we can treat that with antibiotics. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes a little more sense. Okay. So… how do we do the tests? And when? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad that’s a little clearer. For the blood tests, we can do those right here in the clinic. It’s just a simple blood draw – you’ll barely feel a pinch. It’ll take about 10-15 minutes. The CT scan, we’ll schedule that at the hospital. It’s a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. The machine takes images of your neck while you lie still. It usually takes about 20-30 minutes. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning if that works for you. Do you have any questions about either of those procedures?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… okay. Will I… will I need someone to drive me? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? Like, eat or drink anything special?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. For the CT scan, it’s best to have someone drive you, just in case you feel a little tired afterwards. As for preparation, please avoid eating or drinking anything for at least four hours before the scan. You can still take your regular medications with a sip of water, unless I’ve specifically told you otherwise. We'll give you specific instructions when we schedule the scan. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now. Then, we can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll have the nurse come in now to get started with the blood draw. Please let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns at any point. We’re here to support you.
