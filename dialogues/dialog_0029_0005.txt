DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Lennie Tkac, though most folks just call me Lennie. I am here today to get cleared for a senior living facility. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks it’s time I had a little help around the house, and I reckon she's not entirely wrong. I bake a lot, you see, and keeping up with everything is becoming… a bit much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lennie. A pre-admission physical for the senior living facility. That's perfectly reasonable. We want to make sure you're in the best possible shape for the transition. So, let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been fortunate enough to live a long life. I’ve always been a fairly active man, even now I do my best to keep moving. I bake every day, which keeps me on my feet. I’ve had a bit of trouble with my knees lately, mostly just aches and pains, and my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but nothing too serious, I don’t believe. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. Other than that… I’ve mostly just been stubborn and kept going.
DOCTOR: Okay, stubbornness can be a good thing! Pneumonia a few years ago, recovering fully, and some knee aches and pains, and declining eyesight. We’ll definitely want to explore those a bit further. Let’s start with the knees. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor, more of a dull ache that settles in after I’ve been on my feet for a while. Especially after a good day of baking – all that standing and moving around. It’s worse in the mornings, takes a bit to loosen up. And if it rains, or gets really cold, oh boy, it really lets me know it's there. It doesn’t swell up or anything, just… uncomfortable. I’ve been trying to take it easy when I can, but a baker’s gotta bake, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A baker's gotta bake. Alright, no swelling, worse with activity, cold, and in the mornings. That gives us a good starting point. Let's move on to your eyesight. How has that been changing?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, things just aren’t as clear as they used to be. It’s mostly with reading, small print especially. I can still see well enough to get around, to measure ingredients, but recipes… those little words are becoming a real challenge. I’ve been holding them closer and closer, and sometimes I just have to ask my daughter to read them to me. It’s getting to the point where it’s interfering with my work, and that… that’s not something I’m willing to give up easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty with reading, especially small print, interfering with baking. We’ll need to check that out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… no diabetes, no, thankfully. My mother had that, and I’ve always been careful with sweets, despite my profession. High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about it a few years back, said it was a little elevated, but put me on a diet and some exercise. I’ve been pretty good about keeping that in check. My heart… I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, but I do get a little short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m carrying heavy things. It usually passes quickly, but it does worry me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure managed with diet and exercise, and occasional shortness of breath with exertion. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries, Lennie?
PATIENT: Let me think... Yes, as a young man, I had my appendix removed. That was a long time ago, though, back in '62 I believe it was. And… oh, I had a knee operation about twenty years ago. Just a little cleanup, the doctor said. Some cartilage damage, nothing too serious. I recovered well, but the knee hasn't been the same since, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy in '62, and a knee operation twenty years ago for cartilage damage. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, or even over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, Doctor. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though, not every day. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it a few years back. Said I wasn't getting enough sunshine.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and a vitamin D supplement. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat just about anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. My daughter always asks, of course, just to be safe, but I always tell her, “Nope, no allergies here.” I reckon I'm just a lucky man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lennie, that’s a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at those knees. That will give me a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. I understand the need for a good look-see. Go right ahead. I’ve always believed in listening to what the doctor has to say.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the table for me, please. Okay, take a nice deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit of a murmur, which is common at your age. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 85. We'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 78 and regular. Alright, let's take a look at those knees. A little tenderness on the inner side of both knees, and some crepitus – that's a grating sensation – when you bend them. Range of motion is slightly limited. No significant swelling or redness. Now, can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here I am. A little stiff, as always. It takes a minute to get the gears turning in the mornings, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. A little bit of a waddle, and some difficulty with balance, but nothing too concerning. Could you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. One… two… three… four… Is that alright? I try to keep a steady pace, but it’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lennie. That’s good. A slightly wider gait, and some hesitancy. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… my mother, bless her soul, she had diabetes, as I mentioned earlier. And my father, he had a weak heart. He passed away when I was still a young man, from heart failure, I believe. My sister, she had arthritis in her hands, pretty bad towards the end. Other than that, I don't really know much about my family's medical history. We weren't much for talking about such things, back in those days.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with diabetes, father with heart failure, sister with arthritis. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a drop. Never touched a cigarette in my life, and I haven't had a drink of alcohol in… well, I haven't had a drink of alcohol ever. My parents weren’t drinkers, and I just never developed a taste for it. And recreational drugs? Goodness no. I have always been a simple man, content with a good day's work and a warm bed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Can you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do a lot of baking, so there’s usually something sweet around. But I try to eat a balanced diet. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe some soup. And dinner… well, dinner varies. Sometimes it’s a piece of fish with some vegetables, sometimes a small steak, but not too often. I try to limit my red meat. And I drink plenty of water, especially when I’m baking. I reckon a baker needs to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Alright. That sounds reasonable. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently living alone, or do you have someone who helps you out?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. Have for many years now. My daughter, bless her heart, she checks on me regularly, and she helps me with the groceries and the heavier chores. But I manage pretty well on my own, for the most part. I like my independence, you see. I still bake for the whole town, you know? It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lennie. That's good to know. Now, I've got all the information I need for now. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're generally in good health for your age. You have some age-related changes – a little bit of knee pain, some difficulty with reading, and a slightly elevated blood pressure – but nothing that should prevent you from transitioning to the senior living facility. However, I do want to get a few tests done, just to be on the safe side. I'd like to order a blood test to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and I'd like you to get an eye exam to assess your vision. Also, an EKG would be good, to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that’s what you think is best, then I trust your judgment. I have no objections at all. A little poking and prodding never hurt anyone, I suppose. I’ll do whatever it takes to make sure I’m ready for this next step. When would I be able to get these tests done? And will my daughter need to come with me? She worries so.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get those scheduled right away. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood sample here at the clinic tomorrow morning, fasting – meaning no food or drink after midnight tonight. And I’ll give you a referral to a good ophthalmologist for the eye exam. You can schedule that at your convenience. As for your daughter, it’s perfectly fine if she comes with you, if she wants to. It’s always good to have someone for support. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed, and try to stay active, as long as it doesn’t aggravate your knees. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and your kindness. It’s reassuring to know I’m in good hands. Thank you again for everything. I'll go ahead and schedule that blood test, and then I'll have my daughter help me find a good eye doctor. And if I do think of something, I'll be sure to give the clinic a call.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lennie. You're very welcome. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your blood test. Here, let me help you up. And one last thing, I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of today’s visit for you and your daughter, as well as the referrals for the eye exam and the results of the blood tests once they come in.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. I believe I’m all set then. Have a good day, Doctor, and thank you again.
