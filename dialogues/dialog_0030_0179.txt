DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I'm a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. I see here you're a new patient with Medicare. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, Gyamfi is the name. It is… nice to meet you. Well, it is… difficult to explain. Words… they don't come so easy now. I find myself… searching, you know? It is frustrating. I think that is why I am here. My wife… she would always say I had a good way with words… but now… it is… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be concerning when you notice changes in your cognitive function, like difficulty finding the right words. It's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's been going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That is… a good question. It was… not sudden, I think. More… gradual. Perhaps… a few months ago? Maybe longer. It is hard to say exactly. I do remember… struggling to finish sentences when talking to my friends. They would just… look at me. It is embarrassing. It is been… a while, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual onset over several months. That's helpful to know. And you've noticed it specifically when speaking with friends?
PATIENT: Yes. With friends… and sometimes… at the store. I would ask for something… and the word… it would not come. Not important things… just… everyday things. Like… you know… the things you buy. But it is… unsettling. My wife… she always said I had a good memory for names… and now I forget simple things. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me. She… passed away last year. It has been… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife's passing, Mr. Gyamfi. That is a significant loss, and grief can certainly affect cognitive function as well. It's completely understandable that you're experiencing some difficulties right now. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… Well, I… sleep okay, I think. Not as good as before, but… who does? I do… sometimes feel a little… confused. Not all the time. Like… I will go into a room and forget why I went there. Old age, maybe? I also… get tired more easily. Simple things… like walking. It is not painful, just… tiring. And… sometimes… I feel a little… sad. But that is… to be expected, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue, occasional confusion, and some feelings of sadness, in addition to the difficulty with word-finding. It's good you're sharing all of this with me. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Let me see… I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor put me on pills, and it was… controlled. I stopped taking them… oh, maybe ten years ago? The doctor said it was okay. And… I had a bad knee, once. I had surgery, a long time ago. That is… about it, I think. Nothing serious. I am generally… a healthy man. Or… I was. Before all this… word trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, managed with medication in the past, and a previous knee surgery. And you haven't been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else that I recall. Oh! I had the flu, last winter. A bad one. But everyone gets the flu, yes? And… I had all my vaccinations. The doctor insisted. I try to be a good patient. I just… worry about this trouble with words. It is frightening, you know? It makes me feel… old. And helpless.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Mr. Gyamfi, and it's good you're taking this seriously. The flu is worth mentioning, thank you. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No. Not currently. I stopped taking the pills for my blood pressure, like I said. And no… I do not take any supplements. I used to take a vitamin… a multivitamin, but I stopped that… oh, a long time ago. My wife… she always bought them for me. But no, nothing now. Just… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications or supplements. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see… No, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife… she used to ask me that every time I took something new. But no, I don’t have any allergies. I am… a pretty simple man. Not much bothers me. Except… this trouble with words, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like dementia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Family history… That is a difficult question. My mother… she had a weak heart. She died when I was young. And my father… he had… something with his memory, when he got old. Not sure what it was, exactly. My wife… she did the family history. She always kept track of everything. I remember her telling me about my grandfather… he had… strokes, I think. But… it was a long time ago. I am not very good with remembering things like that. It was my wife’s job.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues in your mother, some memory problems in your father, and strokes in your grandfather. It’s alright that you don't remember all the details; that's what we're here for. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My mother smoked, and it… wasn’t pleasant. Alcohol… I used to drink a little wine with dinner, sometimes. But not much. I stopped… oh, a few years ago. My wife… she didn’t like it. And… no, I do not use any recreational drugs. I am… a very boring man. Always have been. Just a quiet life, with my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol use in the past, and no recreational drug use. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I want to ask one last question. Has anything significantly stressful happened in your life recently, other than the loss of your wife?
PATIENT: Stressful…? Well… losing my wife was… the most stressful thing that has ever happened to me. Everything changed. My life… it feels empty now. I used to enjoy gardening… but I haven’t touched the garden since she… passed. I try to keep busy… but it is difficult. The house… it feels too big, too quiet. Nothing else… really. Just… life without her.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been through a tremendous loss, Mr. Gyamfi, and it's completely understandable that you're still grieving. It’s important to acknowledge the impact that has had on your life. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that is alright. If you think it will help… please do. I just… want to feel like myself again. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. It’s a little elevated at 140/90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and neurological function. This involves a few simple tests to assess your strength, coordination, and balance. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Coordination appears intact. Finally, I’m going to do a brief cognitive assessment to get a better understanding of your memory and thinking skills. This will involve a few simple questions and tasks. He has some difficulty recalling the current date and repeating the phrases, but is otherwise oriented to person and place. There’s some mild difficulty with immediate recall.
PATIENT: The date…? Hmm. Is it… August? I think so. I am not very good with dates anymore. And repeating the phrases… yes, that is difficult too. I try… but the words… they don’t stay in my head. I am sorry… I am not doing very well, am I?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s completely normal to have some difficulty with these tasks, especially given everything you’ve been through. This exam is just to give me a baseline understanding of your cognitive function. Based on the information you’ve provided and the results of the exam, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with memory and word-finding, and some mild difficulty with immediate recall. Given your recent loss and the gradual onset of these symptoms, the most likely possibilities are grief-related cognitive changes or the very early stages of mild cognitive impairment. However, other causes need to be ruled out. I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential medical causes. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural problems.
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an MRI? That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? Is it… Alzheimer’s? My mother… she had something like that, I think. I just… want to know what is happening to me. And… can anything be done?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s natural to be frightened when you’re facing uncertainty. It's important to remember that these tests are just to gather more information and rule out other potential causes. It does not automatically mean you have Alzheimer’s. Many things can cause cognitive difficulties, and we need to determine the underlying cause before we can make a diagnosis. The MRI will help us look at the structure of your brain, and the blood tests will help us identify any vitamin deficiencies or other medical issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. If the tests reveal any underlying medical causes, we can address those with treatment. Even if the tests suggest mild cognitive impairment, there are things we can do to manage the symptoms and slow down the progression. This includes cognitive therapy, lifestyle changes, and, in some cases, medication. I also recommend we discuss a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in brain health, for further evaluation and guidance. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, I suppose so. If you think it is best. I just… want to know what is happening to me. And… I want to feel like myself again. What do I need to do? When can I have the tests? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m going to order the blood tests and schedule the MRI for you. The blood tests can be done at the lab right here in the clinic, and we can schedule them for tomorrow morning. The MRI will require a referral, and I’ll send that over to the imaging center. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. The blood tests are a simple blood draw, and the MRI is a painless imaging procedure. You’ll lie still inside a scanner for about 30-45 minutes. It's a bit loud, so you'll be given earplugs or headphones. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with some resources for cognitive health and support groups. It’s important to remember that you're not alone in this. We'll work through this together, one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you… for listening. And… for not dismissing my worries. I appreciate your help. I suppose… I will see you again… after the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could help. And yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests and develop a plan. My nurse will contact you to schedule that after your tests are completed. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi, and please take care. .
