DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... it's my chest. It hurts. Not all the time, but… yeah, it hurts. Like a sore feeling, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A soreness in your chest. Could you tell me a little more about this soreness?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. It’s not like a bad pain, more like… achy. Mostly on this side. And it comes and goes. Sometimes when I move a lot at work, like climbing on the roof, it feels worse. But other times, it’s not there at all. It's been happening for… maybe a month now? I don’t really keep track of dates.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. So, the ache is primarily on the left side of your chest, comes and goes, and seems to be aggravated by physical exertion, specifically climbing. It has been present for approximately one month. To help me understand this better, could you describe the quality of the ache?
PATIENT: Quality? You mean… what does it feel like? Okay. It's not sharp. Definitely not sharp. More like… a dull heavy feeling. Like someone is pushing on it. And sometimes… it feels like it goes all the way to my armpit. But not always. Is that… helpful? I don’t know if I’m explaining this right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Bulaong. A dull, heavy feeling, not sharp, localized to the left chest and sometimes radiating to the armpit. That provides a clearer picture. Now, could you tell me if anything relieves the ache?
PATIENT: Um… yeah. When I stop moving, mostly. When I sit down and rest, it gets better. And… sometimes if I take a warm shower, it feels a little bit better too. But it always comes back when I start working again. I guess resting is the only thing that really helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting and warm showers provide some relief. That’s good to know. To get a more complete understanding, could you please tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing alongside this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. I've been tired, maybe a little more tired than usual, but I work hard, so I always feel tired. And… my wife says I’ve been a little grumpy, but she always says that. Nothing else, I don’t think. No fever, no cough, no… lumps or anything. Just the chest pain and being tired.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. No fever, cough, or palpable lumps, just the chest pain and increased fatigue. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never really been sick. Just… little colds sometimes. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time, honestly. Maybe ten years? I just try to push through everything. My wife keeps telling me I should come, but… I’m okay. Usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses and you haven't seen a doctor in approximately ten years. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I try to be careful at work, but sometimes accidents happen, you know? But nothing serious enough for the hospital. Just bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, regarding your family – do you have any family members with a history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my dad, he had high blood pressure, I think. He was always tired and complaining about his head. And my grandma on my mom's side… she had something with her heart, but I don't remember what. She was very old when she got sick. That’s all I can really think of right now. It’s not something we talk about much.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure in your father and a heart condition in your maternal grandmother. Now, could you tell me a bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I work on roofs, like I said. It's hard work. Lots of lifting and climbing. I eat… okay, I guess. My wife does most of the cooking. We eat rice and fish a lot. And I drink water. Not much else. I don't smoke, and I don't drink alcohol. I try to sleep when I can, but sometimes I wake up tired. It's a simple life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bulaong. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife gives me some medicine for headaches sometimes, but it doesn’t really help. No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if that’s alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and palpating your chest to assess for any tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it hurts.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table. I will begin by listening to your heart and lungs. Take slow, deep breaths. Your heart rate is regular, and I do not detect any murmurs. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though I notice you are breathing a little faster than average. I’m now going to palpate your chest to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if you feel any pain in a specific area. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… a little sore. Right there. Not bad pain, just… achy, like when I’m working. But it’s definitely more noticeable when you press on it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I also detect mild tenderness in that area upon palpation. Now, I would like to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145 over 90. Given your description of the chest pain, your family history, and the findings of the physical exam, I suspect this could be musculoskeletal in origin, possibly related to strain or inflammation of the muscles in your chest wall. However, the elevated blood pressure and family history of heart conditions warrant further investigation. I’d like to order a few tests to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. These include an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a basic blood panel, including a complete blood count and a lipid panel. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests? Okay… if you think it’s necessary. My wife will be happy I’m finally getting checked out. EKG and blood panel… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will write the orders for the EKG and blood panel now. The EKG can be performed here in the clinic. The blood panel will require a small sample of your blood, which we can draw here as well. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, such as climbing on roofs, until we have the results of the tests. If you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly. Just… when will I get the results? And will you tell me what they mean? My wife is good with that stuff, but I… I don't understand much of it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The results should be available within three to five business days. When they are back, we will schedule a follow-up appointment so that we can discuss them thoroughly. I can certainly explain the results to you in a way that is easy to understand. If you would like, your wife is welcome to join us for that appointment as well. I will also provide you with a printed copy of the results and a summary of my findings. We will go over everything together, and I will address any questions or concerns you may have. Before you leave, would you like me to write you a work note explaining that you need to avoid strenuous activity?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A work note would be great. My boss… he doesn’t always understand when I need to rest. He’s a good guy, but… he needs something official. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just knowing what might be going on.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. This note indicates that you need to avoid strenuous physical activity for the next five to seven days pending further evaluation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and help. I'll see you when the results are back. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well, and take care.
