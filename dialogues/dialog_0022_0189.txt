DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And it's about my... well, it's not a pleasant topic, I'll tell you that much. I noticed some... red in the stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. An old man knows his own body, and this isn't right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. Blood in the stool is definitely something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? Honestly, doctors these days. Always wanting to "investigate." What's wrong with just knowing? But fine. It happened two days ago, and again this morning. Not a huge amount, like I said. More like... streaks, you understand? Bright red. And it wasn’t from… well, you know… not a hemorrhoid or anything like that. I keep myself regular. Always have.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. You're right, sometimes it's clear what's happening, but it's my job to rule out anything serious. "Streaks" of bright red blood, and you’re certain it's not related to hemorrhoids... that’s helpful to know. Has there been any change in your bowel habits lately – more frequent movements, diarrhea, constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Good heavens, no! I told you, I keep regular. Like clockwork. Maybe a little less than usual, now that you mention it. But not diarrhea, thank goodness. And no pain, either. Not with it, anyway. Just… blood. It's worrying, that’s what it is. A man shouldn’t be seeing red in his stool. It's unnatural.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good that you haven't had any pain, and that your bowel habits are generally regular. A little less frequent lately is good to note. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – like fatigue, weakness, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I am 88 years old, Doctor. A little weakness is to be expected. But no, nothing new lately. Appetite’s been… okay. Not as much as I used to, but who needs a big appetite at my age? I haven't lost weight, not that I’ve noticed. My clothes still fit. And I’m not tired any more than usual. Just… this blood. It keeps bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No new fatigue, appetite is stable, and your weight hasn’t changed. Just the blood in the stool. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, years ago. Took pills for it, but the doctor took me off them when I retired. Said my stress levels were down enough. Aside from that… no. Nothing much. I’ve always been a healthy man, despite my age. A bit of arthritis in the knees, but who doesn't have that these days? And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, now managed without medication, some arthritis, and an appendectomy as a child. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in loading up on pills. A bit of a walk keeps my arthritis at bay, and I manage just fine. Never been one for taking unnecessary medicines. My father always said, “Let the body heal itself,” and he lived to be 95, so who am I to argue?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Rowbottom. No current medications. Now, have you had any major surgeries other than your appendix removed?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just the appendix, when I was a lad. A simple enough procedure, as I recall. And I’ve never been in a hospital for anything serious. A few broken bones when I was a young pilot, mind you, but nothing like surgery. Always been a tough old bird, you could say.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of any colon cancer, stomach cancer, or any other digestive problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmph. Now there's a question. My mother's brother… Uncle Silas, I believe… he had something. Stomach trouble, I think it was. They took him away in an ambulance, and I don't think he ever came back. That was a long time ago, though. Don’t know what it was exactly, never asked. Family didn’t talk much about illnesses. Thought it brought bad luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of stomach trouble with your Uncle Silas. That's good to know, even if it wasn't a definitive diagnosis. And what about your social history, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? I flew planes for forty years, if that’s what you want to know. Passenger planes, mostly. Travelled all over the world. But that was a long time ago. I’m retired now. Divorced. Keep to myself, mostly. Don't bother with much socializing these days. And I certainly don’t smoke or drink. Never did. Always thought it was a waste of good money.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired pilot, divorced, don't smoke or drink. That's helpful. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like foods or insects?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat most things. Bees sting, of course, like anyone else. But I haven’t had a serious reaction. Just a bit of swelling, nothing to write home about. I’ve always been a hardy fellow, Doctor. A tough old bird.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. No known allergies. Thank you for all that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a digital rectal exam. It's standard procedure when we're investigating blood in the stool. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Now you're talking. Honestly, Doctor, at my age, you're hardly going to find anything new back there. But fine. Do what you have to do. Get it over with. Just be gentle, will you? I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs now... everything sounds good. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm going to do a quick digital rectal exam. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I didn't feel any obvious masses or tenderness. There was a small amount of stool present, consistent with what you described. However, this isn’t enough to rule anything out. Given your age and the presence of blood in the stool, even with a normal exam, I want to be cautious. I’d like to order a Fecal Immunochemical Test to check for hidden blood in your stool. It’s a simple test you can do at home. We’ll also order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A test? More tests? Honestly, Doctor, it’s always something with you people. Fine. Do what you have to do. A test is a test, I suppose. But don't expect miracles. I'm an old man. What’s done is done. But yes, a test, then. Just get it over with quickly. And tell me what all this is going to cost me. I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if it feels like I'm ordering a lot of tests. It's just important to be thorough. The FIT test and Complete Blood Count will give us more information to work with. As for cost, let me check with the billing department. You're not insured, so we do have a sliding scale based on income. I will have someone from billing speak with you after the exam to discuss the options. It shouldn’t be exorbitant, but I want you to be aware of the costs upfront. In the meantime, I’ll write the orders for the tests. I’ll also give you instructions on how to collect the sample for the FIT test. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A sliding scale… that’s something, I suppose. Better than nothing. And a follow-up… of course. More waiting, more poking and prodding. Fine. Do what you have to do. Just get me the instructions for this test. The quicker I can get it over with, the better. And tell that billing person to be clear about the costs. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here are the instructions for the Fecal Immunochemical Test. It's quite simple. You'll collect a small sample of stool at home, using the provided kit, and then bring it back to the clinic. The lab will analyze it for hidden blood. I’ve also made a note for the billing department to contact you regarding costs, and to be as clear as possible about the expenses. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any significant changes in your bowel habits, increased bleeding, or any new symptoms like fever or weakness, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. And tell that billing person to hurry up. I haven't got all day. Honestly, Doctor… all this fuss over a little bit of red. It's a waste of everyone's time, if you ask me. But fine. Do what you must. I'll collect the sample, and I'll wait for the results. Don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your patience. I’ll make a note to expedite the billing process. We're just taking precautions, and it's better to be safe than sorry. Here’s a work note excusing you from work for the duration of this testing process. It’s just a standard form to explain your absence, should you need it. If anything changes before your follow-up, or if you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Rowbottom.
PATIENT: Hmph. A work note. Very well. More paperwork. Honestly… .
