DOCTOR: Right, Lakiya Reihner. Forty-two years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… my back. It hurts. Bad. I want to get this over with, if that’s alright with you. It’s been hurting for a while now.
DOCTOR: “A while” is… vague. When did this start, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… February, maybe? Around then. It started small, just a little ache after work. I do… fence work, you see. Lots of bending and lifting. It's gotten worse each month. I remember because the snow was still bad then, made it harder to get around even before my back started acting up.
DOCTOR: So, February. Fence work. And it’s been progressively worsening. Okay. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s a… deep ache, mostly. Down low. And it shoots down my leg sometimes. Not all the time. More when I move a certain way. Or if I’ve been standing for too long. It feels like… a pulled muscle, but it doesn't feel like a muscle. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: “Pulled muscle” is… not very descriptive. Does it radiate anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: It goes down the back of my leg. My left leg, mostly. Sometimes to my foot. Not tingling, not numb… just ache. Like the ache in my back is going down my leg. And it hurts worse when I try to bend over. I try not to bend over anymore, but… well, you know, fence work.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And has anything… helped it?
PATIENT: Not really. I tried some of those… heating pads. Didn’t do much. And I took some of those over-the-counter pain pills. The red ones. They take the edge off for a little bit, but the pain always comes back. I don’t like taking them, so I don’t take them often. I’ve mostly just been trying to work through it. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: “The red ones.” Okay. Ibuprofen, perhaps?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. They’re red. Little red pills. My neighbor gave them to me. I just told you, I don’t take them much. It’s been a bad year all around. My husband… passed away last year. I don't even remember when, exactly. Just… last year. It's hard to keep track of things. Can we just figure out my back?
DOCTOR: We will get to your back. But I need accurate information. “Little red pills” aren’t a medication. Do you have the bottle?
PATIENT: No. I used them all up. My neighbor... she doesn't remember where she got them either, she said. She just had some extra. Look, I just want something for the pain. I can’t keep doing this. I’m a fence worker, not a doctor! I just need to know what’s wrong, and how to fix it. Medicare covers something, right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on, then. Have you had any problems with your bowels or bladder lately?
PATIENT: What? No. Everything is… normal. Why would that matter? Is this about my back? It doesn't feel like… I don’t know anything about bowels and bladders. Is something wrong with my back? You're making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I’m simply gathering information to rule things out, okay?
PATIENT: Rule things out? What things? Just tell me if it's a bad back, and what I can do about it! My neighbor said I probably just pulled something, but it hasn’t gotten better. I keep telling you, it’s getting worse. Can we just check it, please? I don't understand why you need to know about… everything. This is ridiculous. I have fences to build.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Lie face down on the table, please. We’ll start with range of motion. But I need you to understand, I still need a complete history to make an accurate assessment. This is not simply about "a bad back."
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Just tell me what to do. And please be quick.
DOCTOR: Okay. Can you flex your left leg?
PATIENT: Ow. That… that’s not good. It really hurts when I lift it straight up. Like pulling on a muscle, but… deeper. Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: And how about this?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… that’s very painful. Stop, please! That’s right where it hurts the most. It feels… like a burning. Don't press there! I really think something’s wrong. Is it broken?
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s enough for now. We need to rule out more serious pathology. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. We'll also get some X-rays. The results will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain reliever—something more than “the red pills.” Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t… I don’t think so. I haven’t taken much medicine in a long time. But… an MRI? That sounds expensive. And X-rays… My husband… he had a lot of tests before he passed away. It always ended badly. Will Medicare cover this? I can’t afford a big bill right now. And… what if it’s something really bad?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary testing. We’ll submit the authorization and pre-certification. I can have the office staff follow up with the insurance company to confirm coverage. As for "something really bad," that's why we're doing the imaging—to determine the cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan. It could be a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or a number of other things. We won't know until we see the results. For now, the muscle relaxant and pain reliever will help manage your symptoms. I'm going to write you a prescription for both. Do you have a pharmacy you prefer?
PATIENT: There’s a Walgreens down on Main Street. My neighbor uses them. They're… reliable. Can they just send it over there? I don't want to have to worry about anything else right now. It's… a lot. This whole thing. And what about the fence work? I have a deadline. I don’t know how long I can be off.
DOCTOR: Alright. The prescriptions are sent to the Walgreens on Main Street. The office will schedule the MRI and X-rays for you. They will contact you with the dates and times. I'm recommending you see a specialist—a physiatrist—once we have the imaging results. They are experts in musculoskeletal pain and rehabilitation. I’ll write a referral. As for your fence work… I can provide a note for your employer, explaining your medical condition and limitations. However, I can't guarantee how long you will be unable to work. That depends on the diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A physiatrist… another doctor? This is too much. No. No more questions. Just… please. Just get this over with. I just want my back to stop hurting. I have work to do. Thank you. I think that's all. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The office staff will handle the scheduling and referrals. You'll be contacted shortly. Have a good day. .
