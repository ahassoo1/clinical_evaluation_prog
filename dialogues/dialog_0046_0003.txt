DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, I don't have all day. It's this hand, see? Shakes. Been shaking. My wife… well, she kept telling me to get it looked at. She's gone now, so… here I am. Honestly, I don't know why it's shaking. It just… does.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. And it’s good you're here. We’ll figure out what’s going on with your hand. When did you first notice the shaking?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. When? A while. A good while. Maybe… last fall? Or was it the year before? Honestly, time just… blurs. It's not like it started suddenly, you know? Just… gradually got worse. Not that it’s that bad. I can still eat, mostly. Though soup is a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening since last fall or the year before. I appreciate you clarifying that it wasn’t a sudden onset. And good to know you’re still able to manage most things, even if soup is a bit tricky. Can you describe the shaking to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… shakes. What do you want me to say? It's not a steady thing, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little tremor, other times it's… well, more noticeable. Especially when I try to write. Or hold a glass. It's embarrassing, really. People stare.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it varies in intensity, and is more pronounced with certain activities like writing or holding a glass. That’s helpful information. And it’s completely understandable that it would be embarrassing. Does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Coffee, probably. I like my coffee. Used to drink a pot a day, back when… never mind. And… stress, maybe? Though what doesn't cause stress these days? I don't know. Thinking about it too much probably makes it worse. It's like, the more I focus on it, the more it shakes.
DOCTOR: Okay, coffee and stress seem to be potential triggers, and focusing on it makes it more noticeable. That's very insightful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm not a doctor, you know. I just feel… tired, a lot. Old, mostly. And my handwriting is terrible, even without the shaking. Always was, really. My wife used to have to decipher everything. But no… I don't think so. No other symptoms. Maybe a little clumsy, but I always was.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and a general feeling of being old – which is perfectly normal, Mr. Baide – and some pre-existing clumsiness. No other new symptoms to report. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history... Look, I've lived eighty years, Doc. I've had things. High blood pressure, I think. Maybe some cholesterol issues. My wife handled all that. She went to all the appointments, kept track of the pills. I just… took them. Honestly, I don't remember the specifics. And I'm not about to sit here and try to recall every little thing. It's Medicare, not a memory contest.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Baide. It's perfectly alright that you don't remember all the details. We can access your records through Medicare, which will hopefully give us a clearer picture. Before we do that, could you tell me if you've ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Hmmm. Appendicitis, when I was a kid. That was… a long time ago. And… cataracts, I think. Both eyes. That was a few years back. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. Just the usual old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and cataract surgery on both eyes. That's helpful. And now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem with penicillin or anything like that. I eat everything my wife put in front of me, even when it smelled funny. She was a good cook, mostly. Honestly, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. I've lived too long to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Baide. No known allergies. And now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. Well, there's… a little blue pill for my blood pressure. And something for my cholesterol. Small white one. Honestly, I just take whatever the pharmacist gives me. My wife used to fill those little pill organizers every week. I just grab whatever's in the right slot. I can't tell you the names of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re taking something for blood pressure and something for cholesterol. We’ll get the exact names from your records. Now, before we move on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I came here about a shaking hand, not a whole check-up. I'm eighty years old. What's the point? If something was seriously wrong, I'd know it. Honestly, I'm tired. Can’t we just… skip the exam? I'd like to get home.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Baide. And I certainly don't want to keep you longer than necessary. However, a quick exam will allow me to assess your hand specifically – the tremor, its characteristics, and rule out any other potential causes. It will only take a few minutes, and it will help me to make a more informed decision about the next steps. I promise to be as efficient as possible. At the very least, let me check your reflexes and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Reflexes and coordination. Just get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I'm an old man. And don’t poke and prod too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, let’s start with your knee reflexes. Relax your leg for me… Good. And now the other one… Alright. And let's check your hand coordination. Could you please touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger, then repeat?
PATIENT: See? Shakes. What did you expect? It's hopeless. Can we just be done now? I'm telling you, it's just old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ve observed the tremor and some difficulty with coordination. As you said, there is a noticeable shake, and it does seem to affect your ability to perform precise movements. I’m also checking for any muscle rigidity or weakness, but so far everything feels within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing what’s called an essential tremor. This is a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, often affecting the hands. It typically worsens with age, and can be influenced by factors like stress and caffeine. However, to be certain, and to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests. These will help us to assess your thyroid function and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests. More waiting. Look, Doc, I’m eighty years old. What’s the point of running tests for things I’m probably already dead from? I’ve lived a long life. Just tell me it’s old age and give me something for the shaking. I don’t need a diagnosis, I need a solution.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I respect your feelings. You’re right, at 80 years old, you’ve lived a long life. However, even at this stage, it’s important to rule out any treatable causes for your symptoms. It’s possible that there’s a simple underlying issue that’s contributing to the shaking, and addressing that could significantly improve your quality of life. The blood tests are a relatively simple way to gather more information and ensure we're making the best possible decisions. If the blood tests come back normal, then an essential tremor is the most likely diagnosis. In that case, there are several treatment options available, including medication to help reduce the shaking. We can discuss those options in detail once we have the results. For now, I recommend reducing your caffeine intake and managing your stress levels. Those simple lifestyle changes can sometimes make a significant difference. Would you be willing to consider the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to come back for a follow-up. I'm telling you, it's old age. Don't waste my time. And make sure the nurse is gentle. I bruise easily these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll make a note to request a gentle draw from the nurse. I understand your concerns, and I'll ensure the process is as comfortable as possible. I’ll have the lab order sent over right away, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back – which typically takes a few days – we can review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the shaking becomes significantly worse or interferes with your daily activities, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just get me out of here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll have the nurse come get you shortly. Thank you for coming in today. Please take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: .
