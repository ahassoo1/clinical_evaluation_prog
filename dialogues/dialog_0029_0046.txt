DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, for the past few weeks, I've been experiencing a lot of pressure in my bladder. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least. It just feels full, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A lot of pressure” – can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… a constant heaviness. Like there’s a weight right there. And sometimes, it feels like I need to go right now, even if there isn’t much urine actually coming out. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a constant heaviness and a sense of urgency, even with incomplete emptying. How often would you say you’re going to the restroom now, compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely more frequently. A month ago, I could easily go three or four hours between trips, maybe even longer if I was busy. Now? I'm going every hour, sometimes less. It's disrupting my work, and frankly, it's a bit embarrassing. I’m a graphic designer, and I need to be able to concentrate!
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a significant change. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… no, not really. The color seems normal, and I haven’t seen any blood or anything like that. It just feels different going out, sometimes a little weaker stream, but the appearance itself looks the same as usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no pain in my back or sides. It’s really just this pressure and the frequent urge to go. It’s…focused right there, in the pelvic area. I do feel a little tired, now that I think about it, but I assumed that was just from being… preoccupied.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No allergies that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicines in the past. I do take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. And I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the multivitamin. And you have Medicare – good to know. Now, have you ever had any problems with urinary tract infections, bladder issues, or anything like that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I’ve never had a UTI, or any kind of bladder infection. This is completely new to me. I've always been quite healthy, truthfully. My husband always jokes I'm too stubborn to get sick!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries at all. As for serious illnesses… I had a pretty bad case of the flu a few years back, but nothing major. Otherwise, I've been very fortunate, health-wise. I had all my regular childhood vaccinations, of course, and a flu shot every year. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. What about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some trouble with…weakness, as she got older, but it wasn't specifically bladder-related, as far as I know. Just general frailty. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85. No history of kidney problems or anything like that on either side of the family, as far as I'm aware. It's honestly not something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, never have. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a month, but that’s it. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I find I need to be very clear-headed for my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good to know. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. Then I'll do a quick pelvic exam, just to rule out any obvious issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on. It’s been rather worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's get started then. Please lie down with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. No tenderness to palpation. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any masses or discomfort. Just let me know if anything feels painful. ...No masses detected. Mild discomfort upon deep palpation in the suprapubic region. Now, I'm going to perform a quick pelvic exam. I'll explain each step as I go. ... External genitalia appear normal. No signs of infection or irritation. Internal exam reveals no obvious masses or tenderness. Bladder feels full. Okay, all done.
PATIENT: That wasn't uncomfortable at all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. So, what did you find? The “full bladder” – does that explain the pressure, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. It does likely explain some of the pressure. It seems like you're retaining some urine, even after you void. Given your history and the exam findings, I suspect this could be a few things – maybe a urinary tract infection, though you don't have typical symptoms, or potentially a bladder issue causing incomplete emptying. To be certain, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to rule out infection. And I'd like to check your post-void residual volume – that will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A urinalysis and checking how much is left afterwards… I agree, that’s the best way to figure things out. So, where do we go from there? Do I need to give a sample now?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s start with a urine sample. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom, and instructions are on the counter. Try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream. I’ll give you a sterile container to put it in. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. Depending on the findings, we may need to do further testing, or potentially refer you to a urologist. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very reasonable. A midstream sample... I can do that. And I understand about the possibility of further testing or a referral. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll go do that now. Let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you get back. We'll go over the results as soon as they’re available.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to follow the instructions as best as I could.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. I'll send this off to the lab. It should take a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids, but avoid caffeine and alcohol. And if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or sides, please go to the emergency room immediately. We will call you with the results as soon as we receive them. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll follow your instructions about the fluids, and I'll be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you again. I’ll wait for your call.
DOCTOR: Alright. You're very welcome. Get some rest and stay hydrated. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, Ms. Creagh.
