DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, it’s my hands and feet… they’ve been tingling something awful. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… bothersome, you know? I just want to figure out what it is, if that makes sense. I don’t like feeling like… pins and needles all the time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. “Tingling,” you say… and it’s in your hands and feet. For how long has this been going on, Teretha?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe… three months ago? It comes and goes, mostly. Some days it's barely noticeable, and other days it's… well, it feels like they're asleep, almost. It's hard to say exactly, time just slips away these days. But definitely at least three months. Is that long? I haven’t really been to the doctor in years… my husband always took care of those things.
DOCTOR: Three months… alright. And you said it comes and goes, some days are better than others. Does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. Sometimes I think it’s worse after I’ve been on my feet all day, you know, with the mail route. But even on my days off, it happens. I try to rest, but it doesn’t always help. Maybe when it’s cold? I don’t know… It's just… random. I wish I could tell you something concrete, but I haven’t figured it out yet. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, random… that makes it a little trickier to pinpoint. And you mentioned a mail route… so you do quite a bit of walking?
PATIENT: Oh yes, quite a bit. It’s a big route, lots of houses. I’m on my feet practically all day, five days a week. It keeps me busy, that's for sure. But lately, with this tingling and just… feeling tired, it’s been harder. It’s a good job, good people, but… it's starting to feel like too much. Not that I want to complain. I need the work, you know? I just… hope this tingling isn’t going to stop me from doing it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so a physically demanding job. Now, besides the tingling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my feet have been hurting a little more than usual, just aches, nothing terrible. And sometimes my hands feel a bit clumsy, like I’m dropping things easier. But I figured that was just from being tired, or… you know, getting older. Nothing I thought was worth mentioning, really. It's just the tingling that’s really bothering me. Are those things connected, do you think? I'm not very good at knowing what’s important and what isn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, some foot aches and clumsiness in your hands. Those could be related, yes. We’ll need to explore that a bit. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t really tried to lift anything heavy or anything, so I haven’t noticed a big difference. But sometimes I feel like it takes more effort to… open jars, or button my coat, little things like that. Not a lot, but… maybe? I don't know if that counts as weakness, or just… being out of shape. It’s hard to tell, honestly. I’ve just been trying to take it easy. Is that something I should be worried about? I don't want to make a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re paying attention to these things, Teretha. Any change in your ability to do things is worth exploring. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… no, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago, but the doctor put me on some pills and it went away. I don’t think I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything else. My husband was the one with the health problems, always something or other. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. I don't go to the doctor much, as I mentioned. Honestly, I can't even remember what the name of that blood pressure pill was… it was a long time ago. .
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure in the past, controlled with medication. And no other diagnoses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
