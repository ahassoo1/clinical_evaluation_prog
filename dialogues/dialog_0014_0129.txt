DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, good to see you. Or… as good as can be, I suppose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? It’s this… this stool business. Black, you know? Like tar. Not pretty. And I take those pain pills, the red ones… for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Doctor told me it was fine, but now this happens. Honestly, doctors these days… Always something. I just want to know what’s going on and then get out of here. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Black stool, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Black. Like… well, like when they pave the roads. Not a normal color, is it? And it’s been happening for… oh, I don’t know, a week or so now. Maybe longer. Time just flies when you’re old, you know? I’ve been trying to ignore it, but it doesn’t seem right. I told my husband, Harold, and he just grumbled about me worrying too much. Men!
DOCTOR: Right. A week or so of black, tarry stools. And you’re also taking pain medication… the red ones, you mentioned. Hmm. Now, I'm not saying it’s definitely related to the pills, but those can sometimes cause stomach upset. Though black stool is… concerning. Do you have any abdominal pain, Dawnetta?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my arthritis acts up, of course. That’s always something. But stomach pain… not really. Just a little… discomfort. Like when you’ve eaten too much. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, I’ve had worse just from Harold’s cooking! But this stool thing… it just feels different. It’s… ominous.
DOCTOR: Ominous, alright. We’ll try to figure out what's going on. Now, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… Harold says I’ve been a bit more… irritable lately. But he’s always saying that! He complains I snap at him for no reason. Honestly, men just don’t understand. Other than that… I’ve been a little tired, I suppose. But I’m 73! I’m supposed to be tired. And my appetite’s been a bit off, but honestly, the food these days… just isn’t what it used to be. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: Alright. Irritability, fatigue, decreased appetite... We're getting somewhere. Now, Dawnetta, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, lovely. More poking and prodding. Fine, get it over with. But don’t take too long, alright? Harold’s waiting in the car, and he hates waiting. Honestly, the man has no patience. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as quick as I can. Let’s start with your abdomen. Just lie back on the exam table, and I'll listen and feel around. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Deep breaths, now. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little. There. Just… right there. It's not bad bad, but it's… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Honestly, Harold always says I complain too much. But it is uncomfortable! And that table is cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. Noted. Now, let's check your vitals. Blood pressure, pulse... Blood pressure's a little elevated, 145/90, and pulse is 78. Nothing terribly concerning at the moment. Now, I’m going to need to order some bloodwork. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test to check for blood in the stool. Just to be thorough, you understand. And… honestly, given your symptoms and the black stool, I'm also going to recommend an endoscopy.
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You’re kidding me, right? Stick a camera where? Absolutely not! I’ve heard stories. That sounds dreadful. Bloodwork, fine. But no cameras! Honestly, doctors these days just want to poke and prod and stick things inside you. I don’t like the sound of that at all. And what good will a camera do, anyway? It’s just going to tell me I'm getting old!
DOCTOR: Dawnetta, I understand your hesitation. But the endoscopy is important. Black, tarry stool is a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract. The endoscopy allows us to see where the bleeding is coming from so we can treat it properly. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the problem and rule out anything serious. Honestly, ignoring it could be… dangerous. We need to find out what’s going on, and this is the best way to do it. I’m not trying to poke and prod for no reason. I’m trying to help you.
PATIENT: Bleeding? Now you're scaring me! Harold always said those pain pills weren't good for me. But an endoscopy… it sounds awful. Is it… painful? And what if you find something… bad? Honestly, I don’t want to know if I’m dying! I just want this stool thing to go away. Can't you just give me something for the stool? Something to… stop it?
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a breath. The endoscopy isn’t usually painful. You'll be sedated, so you won’t feel a thing. And yes, it’s true, pain pills can sometimes irritate the stomach lining and cause bleeding, which is why we need to investigate. As for finding something bad… honestly, it's impossible to say without doing the procedure. But early detection is key, and we'll handle whatever we find. I'll refer you to Dr. Ramirez, a very skilled gastroenterologist. He’ll explain everything in detail and answer all your questions. Now, for now, I'm going to order that bloodwork. And I’m going to give you a prescription for a medication to help temporarily reduce the stool, but that is only a temporary fix. It's crucial you follow up with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Bloodwork, fine. A temporary fix is good enough for now. But no promises about this Dr. Ramirez. If he tries to stick a camera anywhere near me, I'm walking out. Honestly, the things they make you go through these days… Just give me the prescription. And hurry up, please. Harold is probably getting impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. This is a bismuth subsalicylate, a bit like Pepto-Bismol, to help settle your stomach and temporarily reduce the black stool. Take it as directed on the label. And I'll print out the bloodwork order and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. Please schedule an appointment with him as soon as possible. It’s very important, Dawnetta. Honestly, delaying this could be… detrimental. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… get me out of here. Honestly, I've had enough doctors for one day. And remind Dr. Ramirez not to try any of those… camera things. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here's your paperwork. The nurse will help you schedule your bloodwork. And I’ll make a note about your concerns regarding the endoscopy. Honestly, I hope you feel better soon. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any problems.
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. And don't expect a thank you note. Honestly, the things they call healthcare these days… .
