DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Jezik, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. It’s in my hands, mostly. Been happening for a little while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It comes and goes. I just wanted to get it checked, if that makes sense. Don’t want it getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Jezik. It's good you're getting it checked out. Okay, so shaking in your hands that comes and goes. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when does it happen? That’s a good question. Not when I’m resting, that’s for sure. Seems to be… when I’m doing something. Like, holding a cup of coffee. Or… trying to write. Though, I haven’t written much lately. Everything’s a bit fuzzy, you see. I used to… well, I used to work with water, a lot of pipes and things. Maybe it started then? I truly don’t recall. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So it seems to be more noticeable with activity, like holding things or trying to write. And you mentioned it might have started when you were working with pipes… Okay. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse… Stress, maybe? When I get flustered, it seems… more pronounced. I don’t get much stress these days, thankfully. I'm mostly retired now. Better… well, sitting still. Just… doing nothing. Not much helps it, really. It just… is. And then it isn't. It's very unpredictable. Is that… is that a problem? I apologize for rambling. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. It's good to get a full picture, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. So, stress seems to make it worse, and it improves when you’re at rest. Has it been getting progressively worse over time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky one. I honestly can’t say. Like I said, things are a bit… blurry. I think it’s been gradually getting worse, perhaps? But I could be mistaken. It’s hard to tell when you don’t pay close attention to these things, you know? I mostly just tried to ignore it until it became… bothersome. Has that been a useful answer? I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Jezik. It's completely understandable that it's hard to pinpoint with memory issues, and that's perfectly okay. Okay, so it sounds like it’s been gradually worsening, possibly. Now, aside from the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not really. Maybe a little stiffness sometimes, in my hands, but I put that down to getting old, mostly. And I’m always a bit tired, but who isn't at my age? No dizziness, no numbness, no pain… I suppose that’s it. Nothing major, anyway. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not much of a complainer. I've lived a long life, and I’ve had my share of aches and pains. This shaking is just… new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, numbness, or pain, just some stiffness and general tiredness. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh dear. That’s… complicated. I don’t really take much these days. I think I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but I stopped. And something for… Honestly, I can't remember. My daughter used to manage all that for me. She moved away, and I… well, I just haven’t bothered keeping track. I don't think I'm on anything currently. But I can't say for certain. It's all a bit of a mess, I’m afraid. I apologize. Truly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Jezik. It sounds like things are a bit disorganized, and that’s perfectly alright. We can work with that. Okay, so you're not currently taking any medications that you're aware of. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your reflexes, coordination, and get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. Please, go ahead. I’ll try my best to cooperate, although I can’t promise I won’t be a bit clumsy. As you've probably already gathered. And perhaps… perhaps you could speak a little louder? My hearing isn’t what it used to be either.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be sure to speak clearly and loudly. Alright, let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. Be gentle, now. I used to be quite strong, you know. Worked with pipes all my life. But that was… a long time ago. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just relax. Good. And now the other side. Now, can you just reach out and touch your nose with your finger?
