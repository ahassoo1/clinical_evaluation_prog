DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Yes, Doctor. It’s… this tiredness. Always tired. Like a very old donkey after a long day. It’s been… a while now. Not good. Makes work hard. Very hard.
DOCTOR: “A very old donkey,” alright. Well, we need to figure out why you're so tired. "A while now" isn’t very specific, Mr. Grumman. Could you give me a better idea of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Maybe… six months? Seven? Around then. Hard to say exactly. Days all feel the same when you’re… like this. It's not a sharp thing, you know? Not like I woke up one day and bam, tired. It just… grew. Slowly. Like weeds. Bad weeds.
DOCTOR: “Grew slowly, like weeds.” Right. Okay. And is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Yes. Always there. Some days worse than others, but… never gone. Even when I sleep, I wake up still tired. Like I didn’t sleep at all. It makes no sense, Doctor. A man needs his rest. Especially a man who works with his hands. I make things, you know? Important things. But hard to make when you feel like… like dust.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "make things," what exactly do you do for work?
PATIENT: I work with cloth. And… things for the house. Furniture covers, mostly. Some curtains. I cut and sew. Measure and… put it all together. It's honest work. Was good work. But hard when your hands shake, and your brain… it forgets things. Like where you put the scissors. Or what color the customer wanted. Small things, but… important. It’s embarrassing, Doctor. A man should remember.
DOCTOR: So, the tiredness is accompanied by some shakiness and… memory problems, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Shakiness, yes. Not all the time, but when I try to do fine work. Hard to hold the needle steady. And the forgetting… small things. Like names. Or… the price of the fabric. I used to know everything. Now… now I have to write it down. My wife, she helps. But a man shouldn’t need his wife to remember prices. It’s… a bad look. And makes things slow. Very slow. Customers get… impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. My stomach… sometimes it’s not good. Feels… swollen. Like too much water. And… I don’t eat as much as I used to. Food doesn't taste the same. Everything feels… bland. My wife makes good food, always, but I just… don’t want it. And… sometimes my skin feels itchy. Very itchy. Like little ants crawling. It’s… unpleasant. Is that important, Doctor? It's just… small things. But they add up, you know? A man feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: "Small things," you say. Alright. Let’s try to get a more complete picture. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… sharp pain. But sometimes… a dull ache. Right here. It comes and goes. More when I’ve been working hard. Like my insides are… tired too. It's not… terrible, but it's there. And sometimes… when I lie down, it feels heavy. Like something is pressing on me. Does that make sense? It’s… hard to explain. It's just… a feeling. A bad feeling.
DOCTOR: “A bad feeling.” Right. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… the doctor, a long time ago, he said my liver wasn't good. I don't remember exactly what he said. Something about… being swollen. He gave me some pills. I took them for a while, but they didn’t make much difference, so I stopped. Old doctor, now. Not here anymore. It was… years ago. And I had the usual things. A cold here and there. A little flu. Nothing serious. My wife, she worries. She says I should have gone back to the doctor. But I'm a busy man, Doctor. Things to do. Things to make. It felt… unimportant. Now… now I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a history of liver issues… and you stopped taking the medication. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never had surgery. No. I don't like… being cut open. Makes no sense to me. A man should be whole. And… I don’t have the time for lying around and getting better. Too much work to do. Too many customers waiting. It feels… foolish to spend time on myself when there are things to be made. My wife, she doesn’t understand. She says I need to take care of myself. But… I’m a strong man, Doctor. I can handle it. Or… I could handle it. Before the tiredness. Before the shaking. Before the forgetting. Now… I’m not so sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. Let’s talk about your family. Any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a hard one. My family… we didn’t talk much about sickness. Back home, it was… bad luck. You didn't talk about bad luck. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He died young. Before I left. My mother… she was strong. Lived a long life. But she had… problems with her stomach, I remember. Always complaining. Nothing specific. Just… a bad stomach. And… my brother, he had the shaking. Like me. But worse. Much worse. He… he couldn't work anymore. That’s why I left. I didn’t want to end up like him. Is that important, Doctor? It feels… a long time ago. A different life. But… the shaking… it scares me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mr. Grumman. A family history of liver issues, stomach problems, and shaking… that gives us something to work with. Now, what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? What do you mean? I work. I make things. I go home. I eat dinner with my wife. We watch the news. Sometimes, we talk. We don't have many friends here. It's a small town. People keep to themselves. I… I used to drink sometimes. Beer. With dinner. But I stopped. A long time ago. My wife, she didn't like it. Said it made me… grumpy. And it didn't help with the shaking. So I stopped. I don’t smoke. Never have. I don’t use… other things. Never have. Is that what you mean, Doctor? I live a simple life. A quiet life. A hard life. But a simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any problems with pills. I didn't take many, but when the doctor gave me something for my liver, I didn’t react badly. No rash, no trouble breathing, nothing. I’m a strong man, Doctor. I don't get sick easily. Except for this tiredness. This… weakness. It’s different. It’s… inside. It’s not like a cold or the flu. It’s like… my body is giving up. Like an old donkey after a very long day. A very, very long day. And… it scares me. It really scares me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman. I understand your concerns. Now, I’m going to need to examine you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. We need to see what's going on inside. This will help us figure out what’s causing this tiredness and weakness. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Grumman. And it’s important. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Is that… necessary? It's cold in here, Doctor. And… I haven’t been feeling very well. It feels… strange to be undressed in front of someone I just met. But… if you say it’s necessary, I will. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be quick. And… be gentle. My body feels… weak. Very weak.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Grumman. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just lie back and relax. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, but there's some tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Palpable liver edge is slightly enlarged. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. No obvious neurological deficits noted. Alright, Mr. Grumman. You can get dressed now. Based on the examination, your liver is enlarged and tender, and your heart sounds are slightly diminished. These findings, combined with your history of liver issues and family history, are concerning. We need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Blood tests? What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? Is it serious? My liver… enlarged? What does that mean? Is it going to… stop working? I feel… scared, Doctor. Very scared. I just want to feel normal again. I want to be able to work. I want to be able to make things. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, please try to remain calm. An enlarged liver can be caused by a number of things—it doesn't necessarily mean it's failing. The blood tests will help us determine the cause—it could be something as simple as inflammation, or it could be something more serious. We need to rule out things like hepatitis, cirrhosis, or even heart failure. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a liver function panel, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your albumin levels. I’m also going to order an EKG to assess your heart function. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on, and then we can discuss treatment options. It’s important to get a diagnosis before we jump to any conclusions. We’ll take it one step at a time. And I will explain everything to you in detail. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… cirrhosis… those sound… bad. Very bad. Is that… what you think it is, Doctor? Is that why my liver is enlarged? And… an EKG? Is something wrong with my heart too? I don’t understand all these… tests. It’s all very confusing. I just want to know… am I going to die, Doctor? Is that what you’re going to tell me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Grumman, please. You are catastrophizing. I said we need to rule out those conditions. That doesn’t mean you have them. It means we need information to determine the cause of your symptoms. The EKG is a standard precaution given your heart sounds were slightly diminished. It will help us assess your heart rhythm and identify any potential problems. I understand you’re anxious, but you’re making this more difficult than it needs to be. I'm a doctor, and I'm here to help you. I need you to calm down and trust me to do my job. We’ll get the results of the tests back within a few days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss them in detail. Until then, try to rest and avoid strenuous activity. And please, try not to worry yourself sick. It won’t help. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, Doctor. I understand. Rest… no strenuous activity. I’ll try… I’ll try to rest. And I’ll wait for the… results. It’s just… hard to rest when you’re… scared. Very scared. Thank you, Doctor. For… trying. And for… not telling me I’m going to die. Not yet, anyway. Is there… anything I should do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Well, since you asked... avoid alcohol completely. And stay hydrated—drink plenty of water. It won’t fix anything, but it’s a good start. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like jaundice, severe abdominal pain, or shortness of breath—go to the emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Here's some information on maintaining liver health. It might be helpful. Alright, Mr. Grumman. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Try to take care of yourself. And please, try to relax. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see.
PATIENT: Yes… yes, Doctor. Thank you. I will… try to relax. And I’ll wait for your call. .
