DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to explain things. It’s… obvious, isn't it? I can't hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s going to droop off. It started yesterday morning. Really quite inconvenient, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling frustrated and want to get to the bottom of this quickly. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness is concerning, and we definitely want to investigate. While it might seem obvious, it's important for me to gather some details to understand what's going on. When yesterday morning did this start exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must you be so… thorough? Fine. It was… around 8:30, I think. I was making my tea. Earl Grey, naturally. And I just… didn't hear the kettle whistle. I thought it was broken, and then I noticed my mouth felt… strange. That’s when I realized something was wrong. Is that detailed enough for you?
DOCTOR: Okay, 8:30 yesterday morning, while making tea. And you noticed the hearing loss first, then the facial weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, that's precisely what happened. Honestly, it's not rocket science. I’m a radiologist, you know. I understand how things work. Though, clearly, some people need a more… simplified explanation. Was there a test I could have taken already? Perhaps something to just show me what's going on? Waiting around isn't helping.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize if I'm being too slow. It’s good to know you have a medical background. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of systems. Have you had any dizziness, headache, or trouble with your vision since yesterday morning?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache? A slight one, perhaps, but I get those frequently. I have a very stressful job, as you can imagine. And vision… no, perfectly fine. Though, I did have to adjust the brightness on my computer screen a little. But that's probably just the lighting in my office. Is this really necessary? It feels like you’re just fishing for things that aren't there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness, slight headache – you get those frequently, and slight adjustment to your computer screen brightness. Good. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling anywhere?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Look, I'm telling you, it's my face and my ear. It's… obvious. Is this how you treat all your patients? Asking endless questions about things that are clearly irrelevant? I haven't had a stroke, if that's what you're implying. I'm perfectly healthy, aside from this… annoyance.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your concern and I'm not implying anything. We have to rule things out. Sudden facial weakness and hearing loss can be caused by several things, and a stroke is one of them, even if it's unlikely. I’m just doing my due diligence. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I eat very healthily. Cholesterol… I suppose I haven’t had it checked in a while. To be frank, I've been rather busy with work. I’m a radiologist, remember? I read scans all day, I don’t have them. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to continue this pointless interrogation? I have appointments to reschedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of high blood pressure or diabetes. Cholesterol not checked recently. And have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago. Nothing else significant. Look, I really don’t understand why I need to divulge my entire life story. I’ve told you the important part: I can’t hear properly, and half my face feels like it’s falling off. Can we please move on to… whatever tests you have available? I’m wasting valuable time here. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to do a neurological exam. That will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. First, let's start with your blood pressure. 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds clear. Now, let’s look at your facial nerves. Can you smile for me?
