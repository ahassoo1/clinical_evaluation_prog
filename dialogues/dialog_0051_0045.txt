DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve been getting…flushed. My face gets very red, and sometimes my neck too. It happens…sometimes when I eat, sometimes not. It's been going on for…oh, maybe a month now? I don’t really know exactly. It’s just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing…redness of the face and neck, sometimes with eating, for about a month. I understand it’s uncomfortable. That's good information to start with. When it happens, does it come on suddenly, or does it build up gradually?
PATIENT: It…usually comes on suddenly. I’m eating, and then, poof, red. Not a slow thing. And it doesn’t always happen with food, you know? Sometimes I’m just…sitting. It’s a little strange. I don't know what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: Sudden onset is important. Not consistently linked to eating either… Alright. And when this happens, do you experience any other symptoms with the flushing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me think. Sometimes I feel a little warm, yes. Not a fever warm, just…hot face warm. And…sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not racing, but…faster than usual. And…no, that’s it, I think. Just the red face, warm feeling, and the heart. It doesn't last long, maybe ten, fifteen minutes. Then it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so flushing, warm sensation, and a slight increase in heart rate, lasting approximately ten to fifteen minutes. No fever, you said. And it’s been happening for about a month. Just to clarify, when you say “fast heart rate”, is it associated with any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I can breathe fine. It just…feels like it's beating a little quicker, that’s all. Like after I climb stairs, but not as much. It’s…hard to explain. It's not scary, just…noticeable. I don’t get dizzy or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable but not alarming, no dizziness, no chest pain or shortness of breath. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes besides eating?
PATIENT: Um…that’s a good question. I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I mostly just notice it when it happens. I work with people all day, you know? Helping them with their…problems. So I don't usually think about what I'm doing when my face gets red. Maybe…stress? Sometimes my work is very stressful. But I don’t know if that’s it. I haven't tried to figure it out.
DOCTOR: Stress is a definite possibility. It’s often a contributing factor. Alright. And just to get a better overall picture, do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little bit of high blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just watch my salt, he said. Other than that…no. I try to eat healthy, walk when I can. I don't smoke, don't drink much. I was married for a long time, but my wife…she passed away a few years ago. So…mostly just trying to keep busy.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It’s understandable that you'd focus on keeping busy. And good to hear you generally maintain a healthy lifestyle. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I had some trouble sleeping for a while after my wife died, but I just…tried to get more exercise instead of taking anything. And that seemed to help. Just a little walking, mostly. I don't really believe in all those…supplements. Waste of money, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I've been a counselor for a long time, I know how these things work. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. It will be very straightforward, nothing uncomfortable at all. Your heart rate is a little elevated, around 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to being in the office. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Skin looks normal overall, no rashes or concerning lesions. I do notice some mild flushing on your face, even at rest. It's not severe, but it's present. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing episodes of vasomotor flushing. There are several potential causes, ranging from benign things like spicy foods or stress to less common possibilities. Given your history of slightly elevated blood pressure, we should investigate that further.
PATIENT: Vasomotor…what now? Is that bad? And what do you mean, investigate my blood pressure? Do I need…tests? I don’t really like tests. I always worry about what they'll find.
DOCTOR: Vasomotor flushing refers to a widening and narrowing of blood vessels, which causes the skin to become red and warm. It's not necessarily bad, and often has a simple explanation. Think of it like your body's temperature regulation system getting a little…overactive. As for investigating your blood pressure, yes, I would like to order some basic blood work and a 24-hour blood pressure monitor. The blood work will help rule out any underlying medical conditions, and the monitor will give us a more accurate picture of your blood pressure throughout the day. It’s just to be thorough and ensure there isn't anything we need to address. It's a standard procedure. I understand your hesitation about tests, and I assure you we'll only order what’s necessary. We can discuss the results thoroughly and come up with a plan that you’re comfortable with. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: A 24-hour monitor? So I have to…wear something all day? And blood work…need to give them a lot of blood, do I? I don't like needles, doctor. Not at all. But…I suppose if it'll help figure out what's wrong, I can try. It's just…I worry a lot. My wife always took care of these things. I’m not very good at it, all this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. The 24-hour blood pressure monitor is a small device that you wear on your arm, connected to a cuff that inflates automatically every 20-30 minutes. It’s not uncomfortable, and you can go about your daily activities as usual. As for the blood work, it’s just a few vials – a couple of tubes of blood. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can take things slow if you're anxious. We can also use a topical numbing cream beforehand to minimize any discomfort. We’ll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly. I'll also write down clear instructions for both tests, and my staff will be happy to answer any questions you have. How about we start with scheduling the blood work?
PATIENT: Okay…scheduling the blood work. Yes, I suppose that’s best. Can I eat before, or should I…fast? My wife always said I got grumpy when I was hungry. And…where do I go? Is it here, in the clinic? And how long will it take? I have a client at two o’clock. I really don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question about fasting. For this particular blood work, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. Just water is okay. And yes, your wife was right, it's best to avoid being hungry! The lab is located just down the hall, in Suite 203. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes, including the wait time and the blood draw itself. We can schedule it for 10:00 AM, which should give you plenty of time to get back for your 2:00 PM appointment. Here's the requisition form – you'll need to take this to the lab. And here are the instructions for fasting. Please let the lab technician know if you're anxious about needles, they are very good at making patients feel comfortable. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay…ten o’clock. And just water. I can do that. Suite 203…I’ll remember. And I’ll tell them I’m nervous about the needle. My wife always said I was a baby about these things. Thank you, doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I’m still a little worried, but…I feel better knowing what’s going on. I’ll see you after the tests, then. I hope they don’t find anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It's my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And try not to worry too much – we'll take things one step at a time. I’m optimistic that we’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
