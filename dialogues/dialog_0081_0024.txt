DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need a letter, actually. Just confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but I’m traveling for the first time since my husband passed, and the airline needs a note from a doctor.
DOCTOR: A note for fitness to fly… yes. And this is related to emotional distress following a loss, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s not… a physical thing, not at all. It’s just… they want to be sure I won’t have any issues on the plane, you know? Panic attacks or anything. Honestly, I feel fine, but I understand their concern. It’s been… a little over a year, and I’ve been doing okay, but travel was his thing. So it feels… different.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Travel can certainly bring up difficult emotions, regardless of how well one is coping overall. A year is a reasonable amount of time, but as you said, the context is important. To be thorough – and for the airline’s benefit – I’ll need to ask a few questions. It's standard procedure. Have you experienced any panic attacks specifically, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No, not exactly panic attacks. I’ve had… moments. Just feeling really overwhelmed, a lot of crying, trouble sleeping the night before we were supposed to go somewhere. But nothing… debilitating, never anything on a plane, thankfully. Mostly it's just the anticipation. And now, doing this without him.
DOCTOR: “Moments of overwhelm, anticipatory anxiety, no history of panic attacks during travel.” Alright. Have you been seeing anyone for grief counseling or support?
PATIENT: Yes, for a few months after… it was through the hospital, actually. It helped a lot, getting things out. I stopped about six months ago, though. I felt like I was in a good place. I've mostly been relying on friends and family. Is that… is that okay? I didn't want to bother anyone if it wasn’t necessary.
DOCTOR: “Okay” is a relative term, Ms. Sayar. Support systems are important, but a formal therapeutic intervention… well, it would have been more thorough. But it sounds as though you've managed to cope. Have you noticed any recent changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or appetite?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything’s been pretty stable. I’m sleeping okay – maybe a little too much sometimes, honestly. But no major changes. I'm eating normally, going to work... I keep busy. It's just...this trip feels bigger than just a vacation. It's to see his sister, which... It's complicated.
DOCTOR: “Stable” is good. We are looking for significant deviations from your baseline, and it doesn't sound like there are any. Do you have any history of anxiety or depression prior to your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I've always been… pretty level-headed, to be honest. I mean, everyone gets stressed, but nothing I would ever consider a problem. He was always the worrier in the family, not me. He had a little bit of everything, to be honest. Which is why I worry about… about being on the plane, you know? It just feels so… wrong without him.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it sounds as though your anxieties are situational, and a reasonable response to a difficult circumstance. Just to be completely thorough, I’d like to do a very quick physical exam—just to rule out any underlying physical issues that might mimic anxiety. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard procedure, Ms. Sayar. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. I understand needing to be thorough. Honestly, anything to get this letter so I can just… get on the plane. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. Deep breath… and again… Normal breath sounds bilaterally. Pulse is… 78 and regular. Blood pressure… 120 over 80. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Everything appears within normal limits. No acute findings.
PATIENT: That’s… good to hear. So, does that mean you can write the letter? I don’t want to push, but I do need to book the flight. It gets expensive waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sayar, I can certainly write a letter stating that you are medically cleared to fly. However, it will be a very… specific letter. It will state that your anxieties are related to bereavement, that a physical exam revealed no contraindications to travel, and that you are deemed capable of safe travel, assuming appropriate coping mechanisms. It will not be a blanket endorsement of unlimited travel without addressing potential emotional distress. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly fine. Honestly, that sounds very reasonable. I wasn’t expecting a free pass to travel the world without thinking! Just needing something for the airline. Coping mechanisms… I can handle that. Thank you, Doctor. That’s a huge relief.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have my nurse print it out for you before you leave. It's imperative that you utilize your support system and acknowledge potential emotional challenges during travel. Avoid excessive alcohol or caffeine, and prioritize rest. And Ms. Sayar, if you experience any concerning symptoms – panic attacks, severe anxiety, inability to function – seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand completely. Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I appreciate your… thoroughness. Is there anything else? Or should I just wait for the nurse?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Sayar. That will be all. The nurse will bring the letter shortly. Please, try to… manage your expectations during travel. It will be an emotional experience. And do not hesitate to seek support if needed. You're dismissed.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time. .
