DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Geho, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol was a little high. The numbers, they weren't… right, I guess. I don't really understand all those numbers, to be honest. That’s why I’m here!
DOCTOR: Right, the letter. Yes. Those numbers can be confusing. Okay, so your total cholesterol was… well, it was elevated. We like to see that number below 200, and yours was 245. And your LDL, that’s the “bad” cholesterol, was 160, when we prefer it to be under 100. Your HDL, the “good” cholesterol, is… decent, at 45, but could be better. Do you have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. Okay, those are… big numbers. I don't think I've ever really paid attention to those before. Let's see... family history... Hmm. My father, he had a heart attack when he was in his 70s, I think. And his brother... I think he had some problems with his heart too, but I'm not really sure. It was a long time ago and my mother didn't talk about it much. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It counts. Vague is better than nothing, I suppose. It suggests there’s some predisposition. And even without a strong family history, elevated cholesterol is something we need to address. Do you have any other health problems?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I walk most days, try to eat okay… nothing too crazy. No diabetes, no blood pressure problems… just the cholesterol, apparently!
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Nothing at all. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know? I prefer to… handle things naturally if possible.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s good to know. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then we can talk about what your options are. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies! Not to anything, thankfully. And that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m a little nervous, but I’m glad we’re talking about this.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Okay, 140 over 90. A little high, but we'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Okay. Everything sounds… reasonably normal. There’s a slight murmur, but that’s not uncommon. Now, I’m just going to palpate your abdomen, feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Alright. Everything feels normal there as well. Now, let’s talk about these numbers, and what we can do to get them under control. We've got elevated cholesterol and slightly elevated blood pressure. Lifestyle changes are always a good first step, but depending on your risk factors, medication may be necessary. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well, that sounds… reassuring about the heart and everything. I'm glad nothing serious jumped out. And no, I definitely don’t smoke! Never have. And I drink… sometimes. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy, though. I'm not a big drinker at all. I mostly just enjoy a nice glass of red wine with my pasta.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional red wine is… manageable. Let’s be frank, Ms. Geho. Your numbers aren’t ideal, and with the slightly elevated blood pressure, we need to take this seriously. Lifestyle changes – a low-fat diet, regular exercise – are important, but realistically, you may need medication to get your cholesterol down to a safe level. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. I mean, I figured as much. I’m not afraid of taking medication if I need to, but I was hoping to avoid it if possible, you know? I just don’t like the idea of being on pills forever. But if it’s for my health, then… I’m willing. What kind of medication are we talking about? And what would that mean?
DOCTOR: Well, the most common medications for high cholesterol are statins. They work by blocking a substance in your liver that produces cholesterol. They're generally very effective, but like all medications, they have potential side effects. Muscle aches are the most common, but serious side effects are rare. We'd start you on a low dose and monitor your liver function and cholesterol levels regularly. And it’s usually a lifelong commitment, Ms. Geho. Cholesterol doesn’t just magically go away. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: Oh… lifelong. That’s… a long time. Muscle aches… I do walk a lot. That wouldn’t be good. Liver function… that sounds serious. Hmm. Are there… other options? Maybe something less… intense? I mean, I eat pretty healthy, I walk almost every day... is there anything I could do more of? Or… something else I could try before committing to a pill for the rest of my life?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Geho, I understand your reluctance, but we need to be realistic. Diet and exercise are important, but they often aren’t enough, especially with borderline numbers like yours. There are other medications besides statins, yes, but they are generally less effective and have their own set of side effects. We could try a bile acid sequestrant, but they often cause digestive issues. Or ezetimibe, but it’s not as potent as a statin. Ultimately, a statin is the gold standard for lowering cholesterol and reducing your risk of heart disease. We can start with a very low dose, monitor you closely, and if you experience any side effects, we can adjust the medication or try something else. But delaying treatment is not a good idea. Every day you wait, your risk increases. Are you willing to consider a low-dose statin and see how you feel?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. A low dose… and we’ll watch things carefully. Yes, alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. But if I start feeling unwell, even a little bit, I want to know right away. And if it's causing me problems, I want to stop. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Geho. That’s perfectly reasonable. We will start you on 10mg of atorvastatin, once daily, in the evening. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to recheck your cholesterol levels and assess how you’re feeling. If you experience any muscle aches, fatigue, or digestive issues, call the office immediately. We’ll also order a comprehensive metabolic panel to monitor your liver function. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Six weeks… and watch for side effects. 10 milligrams, in the evening. Okay. Will this interfere with my walking? Or my wine?
DOCTOR: The atorvastatin should not interfere with your walking. As for the wine… moderation is key. One glass with dinner is unlikely to cause any problems, but excessive alcohol consumption can increase your risk of liver problems. We are trying to improve your health, Ms. Geho, not hinder it. I'm going to print out a summary of our discussion, including instructions on how to take the medication and a list of potential side effects. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your overall health. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Okay, I’ll try to be good. And I’ll schedule an appointment with my doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care, Ms. Geho. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
