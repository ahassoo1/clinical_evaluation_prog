DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, it’s my ear, you see. Feels… blocked. Full, like something’s stuffed in there. It’s been… a bit of a bother. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Time gets away from me, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, time does tend to slip away. Blocked, you say?
PATIENT: Right. Blocked… or maybe just… muffled? It’s hard to explain. Not painful, thankfully. Just… not right. I can hear, mostly, but it’s like there’s cotton wool in there. Does that make sense? I work outside a lot… agricultural inspections, you see. Perhaps something got in? I really wouldn't know.
DOCTOR: Agricultural inspections… right. And when did you first notice this… muffled feeling?
PATIENT: Honestly? I'm… not sure. A week? Maybe two? It all blurs together. It wasn't sudden, if that helps. More like… I just realized it was harder to hear things one day. My wife… she always noticed these things first. But… well, never mind that now. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say without a proper examination. We’ll need to take a look. Have you experienced any dizziness, ringing in the ears, or discharge?
PATIENT: Dizziness… not really. No. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? A very faint sort of… hum. But I often hear machinery all day, so I just put it down to that. Discharge? No, nothing like that. Just… the fullness. And a bit of trouble hearing when it's noisy. Do I need to worry?
DOCTOR: Worry is rarely helpful, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Let's have a look at the ear. Please sit forward a little. I’ll need to take a quick look inside. It's likely just wax, honestly. But we need to rule other things out.
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, alright. Go ahead. I don't like things in my ears, never have. But… if you think it's best. Do be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I have a schedule to keep, you see. And honestly, it's rather unsettling, having things poked about in there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there's a significant wax impaction in both ears. That explains the fullness. Not alarming, but certainly uncomfortable. It is impacting your ability to hear properly.
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Both ears? Well, that’s… good to know it’s not anything dreadful. Can you… just remove it? Is that what you do? I’ve never had this done before, to be honest. And will it hurt? I’m not good with pain, you see. It’s been… a difficult time lately.
DOCTOR: We can remove it, yes. It's a common procedure. We have a couple of options. We can try irrigation, which is flushing the ear with warm water. Or, I can use a small instrument to physically remove it. Irrigation is gentler, but doesn’t always work. The instrument is more effective, but can be slightly uncomfortable. Given your… aversion to discomfort, we’ll start with irrigation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Irrigation sounds… preferable, yes. Definitely. No poking, if you don't mind. Just… flushing. Is it… loud? I don't like loud noises, either. And will I need to come back again, if it doesn’t work the first time? I'm really trying to avoid… prolonged visits, you see. Time is… precious.
DOCTOR: It will involve a brief burst of water. Not painful, but a sensation of pressure, perhaps. And yes, it’s possible a second attempt may be needed. It depends on the consistency of the wax. We’ll do our best to resolve it efficiently. Lean your head forward a little… and try to relax. It really won’t take long.
PATIENT: Right. Relax… Yes, I’ll try. It’s just… the thought of water in my ear… Never been fond of water, to be honest. But if you think it’s best. Just… hurry, please. And let me know if you need anything. I do have… appointments. Though they're not terribly important, I suppose. Just… let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guerrerolopez, I'm going to start now. You may feel a little pressure. Hmm. That's not dislodging it as much as I’d like. Okay, let's try the other ear. It seems you have quite a stubborn impaction. Irrigation isn't fully effective. We will need to proceed with manual removal. It will be slightly uncomfortable, but I will be as gentle as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Manual removal… Well, that’s what I was afraid of. Slightly uncomfortable, you say? I really don’t… I don’t do well with discomfort, Doctor. Is there absolutely nothing else we can try? Perhaps some… drops? Or something? My wife… she always preferred the least invasive methods. Alright. If you absolutely have to… but please, be as quick and gentle as you can. I’m trusting you. Just… let me know when it’s over.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll use a small curette to gently remove the wax. I’ll let you know when I’m finished. I understand your… sensitivity. Please remain still and try to relax. It will be a few seconds at most. Alright, here we go… There. That's the bulk of it removed from both ears. Much better.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t pleasant. Is it… finished? Truly finished? And can I hear properly now? Everything sounds… different. Slightly muffled still, perhaps? I really need to get going, Doctor. My schedule… Is there anything else I need to do? Any aftercare instructions? Or will I just… be alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s finished. I’ve removed the impaction from both ears. You may experience a slight feeling of fullness or temporary muffled hearing for a short period, which should resolve on its own. Avoid getting any water in your ears for a few days. And do not use cotton swabs – they only push the wax further in. Honestly, Mr. Guerrerolopez, that’s all there is to it. You are alright. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a printed summary of these instructions. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. No, I suppose not. Just… avoid water, no cotton swabs… alright. Thank you, Doctor. Though I’m not sure it was a particularly… pleasant experience. Very well, then. I’ll just… be going. Thank you again. .
