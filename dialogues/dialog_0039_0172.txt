DOCTOR: Hello Candice, welcome. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, dear, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. Someone said I should come. New to the area, you know. Medicare insisted. It’s all very… disruptive. And really, I’m a busy woman.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Candice, it happens more often than you think. Medicare sometimes recommends check-ups, and it’s good to get things looked at. No need to worry. Let's just take things slowly, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well. But do try to be quick about it. My husband will be expecting me shortly, and he doesn't appreciate being kept waiting. What exactly are you hoping to… ascertain?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. We'll be as efficient as possible. Generally, when someone comes in for a new patient visit, I like to get a bit of your medical history – things like past illnesses, any medications you take, allergies… just to get a general picture of your health. And I'll do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly. I’ve lived a perfectly respectable life. Perfectly respectable. And I assure you, I know my own body. Physical exam... is that absolutely necessary? It all seems rather… undignified. Do tell me what you hope to find.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candice. It’s not about finding anything wrong, it's more about establishing a baseline, a starting point for your care. Knowing your history helps me understand what’s normal for you, and it helps us catch anything that might change in the future. The exam is quite routine - checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, perhaps looking in your ears and eyes. It helps me get a complete picture. It’s a standard part of a check-up, and I promise to be as respectful and discreet as possible. Perhaps we can start with some questions, and if you’re still uncomfortable with the exam later, we can certainly discuss alternatives. Does that sound more agreeable?
PATIENT: Alternatives? Honestly. Very well. Questions, then. But keep them brief. And I warn you, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Don't expect a detailed recitation of every childhood ailment. Just… ask what you must, and I shall attempt to comply. But I truly don’t see the point of all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I completely understand. We’ll take it very slowly. Perhaps we can start with something simple. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Generally? As well as can be expected for a woman of my age, I suppose. A few aches and pains, naturally. Nothing of consequence. I get tired easily, but who doesn’t? And the weather is dreadful. It’s damp. Terribly damp. Is that what you’re after? A list of minor complaints?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. I’m just trying to get a sense of things, Candice. The aches and pains, do they occur in any specific areas of your body?
PATIENT: Everywhere, dear. Honestly, it’s like living in an old house. Everything creaks and groans. My knees, mostly. And my back. And sometimes my… elbows. It’s all rather tiresome, really. I used to be able to garden for hours, you know. Now… well, now I mostly sit. It’s a waste, truly. A terrible waste. Are you writing all this down? It sounds awfully… detailed.
DOCTOR: I am, Candice. It helps me to keep track of things. And it's good to know what's been bothering you so we can work on improving it, if possible. You mentioned gardening – how long have you been unable to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… years, I suppose. Several. It started gradually, you know. A little stiffness here, a little ache there. Then it just… became too much. My husband tries to help, bless his heart, but he doesn’t have the touch. He mangles the roses, you see. Utterly mangles them. It's… depressing. I don't remember exactly when it stopped, dear. Time just… slips away. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Candice. Just a few more questions. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Oh, yes. A little something for my blood pressure. And sometimes a tablet for… what is it? Something for the… ache. Yes, ache. The little white one. The doctor prescribed it last winter. It doesn't seem to do much good, honestly. And I take a vitamin, I suppose. A general one. Do you need the names? Honestly, I never bother with keeping track. It all feels rather… chaotic.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Candice. Don’t worry about the names, we can look those up later. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I've always been a remarkably robust woman. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to… dust. It makes me sneeze. But that's hardly an allergy. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband has sensitivities, poor man. But I am perfectly fine. Now, are we absolutely finished? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candice, we're almost finished with the questions. Just one last thing. Could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly. That's a rather broad question, dear. My mother lived to a respectable age, I suppose. She died in her sleep, thankfully. My father had… something with his heart, I believe. But I wasn’t very interested in medical matters as a child. And frankly, I’ve never kept track. It all happened a long time ago. Really, I don't see what possible relevance it could have to my health. Are we quite done now? I feel a nap coming on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Thank you for sharing what you could. Now, I think it would be helpful if I did a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I told you, I do not consent to a physical examination. I have no intention of being poked and prodded by a complete stranger. It’s undignified, unnecessary, and frankly, rather invasive. I've lived a long life without it, and I see no reason to start now. I believe I’ve answered your questions sufficiently. Perhaps a referral to a specialist would be more appropriate? Someone who doesn’t insist on… physical indignities. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand. I apologize for any discomfort my suggestion caused. Given your reluctance for a physical exam and difficulty recalling details, I think a referral to a specialist – perhaps a geriatrician – would be the best course of action. They can spend more time with you and address your concerns. I will write a referral for you and include the information we discussed today. Would that be alright?
