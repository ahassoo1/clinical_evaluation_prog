DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Gegan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get on with it. It's my… well, my poop. It's black. And I take those pills for my arthritis, you know, the ones the doctor keeps giving me. Been taking them for years. It’s probably that. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you’re aware of the change in your stool color, and that you've been taking arthritis medication for some time. Black, tarry stools can have a number of causes, and it's good we're talking about it. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? I don’t know exactly. A few days, maybe? It’s not like I stare at it, you know. I just noticed it wasn’t… normal. And like I said, those pills! They make your stomach all upset anyway. I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not like I'm bleeding or anything. Is this going to take long? My husband is waiting in the car.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. Knowing when you first noticed the change is helpful, even an approximate timeframe. So, a few days ago… Has the stool been consistently black, or has it been more intermittent?
PATIENT: Consistently, I think. Every time I go. And it smells… well, it smells like something died. Those pills, I tell ya. They change everything. Look, I just want to know if I need to worry or not. Is it serious? Because I’ve got a garden to tend to, and I don't have time for… well, you know. Hospital stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get back to your garden, and wanting to know if this is something serious. Black, tarry stools, as you’ve noticed, can be related to medications, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. The smell can sometimes give us clues, but it’s not always definitive. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've experienced any other changes alongside this – any abdominal pain, weakness, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. My stomach has been a bit queasy, now that you mention it. Not throwing up or anything, just… unsettled. And I get tired easily, but I'm 73, you know? That's just what happens when you get old. Pain? Not really. Maybe a little cramping sometimes, but I get that all the time. My back isn't what it used to be, either. Is this getting somewhere, or are we just talking about my age now?
DOCTOR: We're definitely getting somewhere. It's helpful to know about the queasiness and the cramping, even if it's not severe. It's good you’re telling me everything, even things that seem minor. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, and gently feel it to check for any tenderness. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Just get it over with. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me my whole life. But don’t take too long. Honestly, I don't see what good it'll do. It's probably just those pills, like I said. But go ahead, if you must. Just… be gentle, alright? My skin is sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. I'll start by listening with the stethoscope, and then gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little diminished. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side, but no significant guarding or masses. Your abdomen is soft overall. I don't feel anything immediately concerning, but the tenderness is something we need to investigate a little further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What does that mean? Are you going to send me to the hospital? Because I’m telling you, it's those pills! They mess with everything. I've been on them for years. Don't you think you should just… monitor it? See if it goes away? I really don't want to have a bunch of tests done. It's a waste of time and money, honestly. My husband will be furious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I certainly don't want to rush into anything unnecessary. "Investigate" simply means we'll do some basic tests to help us understand why you're experiencing these changes. It doesn't automatically mean a hospital stay or anything major. Given the black stools, the mild tenderness, and the fact that it's been ongoing for a few days, I would recommend a couple of tests. A stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to see if you’re anemic. These will help us determine if there's internal bleeding, and rule out other potential causes. It’s important to rule things out, even if it turns out to be something simple. Would you be okay with those two tests?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But I’m telling you, it's those pills. But if you insist… blood tests and… what was the other one? Stool tests? Honestly. I feel like I’m being treated like a child. But fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. I have things to do. And make sure your nurse explains everything clearly. I don't want any surprises. Where do I go to get these tests done? Is it here? I really don’t want to have to drive all over town.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if you feel that way. I want to assure you I’m taking your concerns seriously, and we’re doing this to get you the answers we need. The lab is right here in the clinic, so you won't have to drive anywhere. I'll write you a requisition form for both tests. The nurse will come in shortly to explain the procedure and draw your blood and give you instructions on collecting the stool sample. It shouldn't take long at all. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And tell your nurse to be quick about it. I haven't got all day. Honestly. This is a ridiculous amount of fuss over… well, you know. My poop. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Thank you for your patience, Dawnetta.
