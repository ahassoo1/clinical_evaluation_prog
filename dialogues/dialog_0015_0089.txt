DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been acting up again. Honestly, it’s hard to say when it started, exactly. Things just… blur together after a while, you know? But it’s been quite painful lately. I believe that’s why the office called, actually? Something about… episodes? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, the notes indicate some recurring abdominal pain. “Episodes” is a rather imprecise term, but it’s a start. “Lately” is also… not particularly helpful. Could you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I am sorry. Specific… right. Well, let me think. It’s been… worse these past few weeks, I suppose. Maybe a month? It comes and goes, like waves, you know? Not constant. But when it is there, it really takes my breath away. A sharp pain, mostly. Sometimes cramping. It’s… difficult to describe. I do have… something with my immune system, I recall. Lupus, perhaps? Does that make a difference? It’s all rather a muddle, I confess.
DOCTOR: Lupus could be relevant, yes. Though abdominal pain isn’t typically a primary symptom. Let’s try to establish a timeline. A month of these "waves"… are they related to anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… related to anything? That's a good question. I don’t… I truly don’t think so. I haven’t changed my diet, not significantly. I haven’t been traveling. I… I mostly stay home, to be honest. I do enjoy gardening, but that hasn’t changed much either. Oh! I did help my niece move some furniture a few weeks back. Perhaps that strained something? It’s a long shot, I suppose. It’s just… they happen seemingly at random. And they're getting… more frequent. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Helping with moving could be a factor, though the timing seems a bit off for a musculoskeletal injury to be the sole cause. More frequent… and are the episodes becoming more severe as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely more severe. The first few times, it was… uncomfortable, certainly. But I could manage with a little rest and some… tea, I think. Now… now it feels like a tightening, almost. And the pain radiates… down into my legs, sometimes. It makes me quite breathless, as I mentioned. I had to lie down for a good hour yesterday, just to get my bearings. It’s… quite frightening, to be honest. I worry something serious is happening. It wouldn't be the first time, you see.
DOCTOR: Radiating pain and breathlessness are concerning. And you mentioned a history of… other medical issues?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A great many. It’s… a long list. The lupus, as I said, though I don't always remember exactly what that entails. There was something with my kidneys, years ago. And… I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia a few years back. It left me quite weak for a while. And… honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur. I see many specialists, and they all talk about different things. It’s very hard to keep track. I do have my insurance information if that's helpful? I brought it just in case.
DOCTOR: Insurance information is helpful, thank you. We'll need that regardless. But let’s focus on the present. You said something about your kidneys years ago. Do you recall what the diagnosis was, or roughly when it occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years… that must have been… oh, dear. The early 2010s, perhaps? It was a… glomerulonephritis, I think? Something about inflammation. I remember a lot of tests, and a rather unpleasant diet for a while. It was treated, thankfully. I've had regular check-ups since, and everything seemed… stable. But, again, it was a long time ago, and I don't recall all the specifics. It's… just the way my memory is these days, Doctor. It’s a rather frustrating thing. I apologize for not being more… precise. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: Glomerulonephritis… Yes, I see some records from 2013. Alright. Ms. Glymph, given your history of lupus, prior glomerulonephritis, and the current symptoms of abdominal pain radiating to your legs, along with breathlessness, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and feel for any tenderness. We may also need some blood work and a urine analysis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Anything you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. A physical exam sounds… sensible. And blood work and a urine analysis, yes. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. I’m… rather anxious to find out, to be honest. Please, go right ahead. I’ll do whatever I can to help. Just… be gentle, if you would. It's rather sensitive, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Does this cause any particular pain?
PATIENT: No, not yet. Just… a little pressure. It's… uncomfortable, but not painful. Yet. Oh! There. That's… a bit tender. Yes, right there. It's a… sharp ache, almost. It’s not constant, but definitely more sensitive there. It feels… almost bruised, if that makes any sense. And… oh dear. That does feel different than usual.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the left lower quadrant… and you describe it as a sharp ache, feeling bruised. Any pain when I press down and release quickly?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. There! That hurts. It’s… a sharper pain, and it radiates outwards, a bit. It feels… almost like a muscle spasm, but deeper inside. Yes, definitely when you release quickly. It's… rather unpleasant. I'm… trying to be brave, Doctor. It's just… not very comfortable at all. I do apologize if I’m being difficult.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Glymph. You’re providing valuable information. Guarding and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant… Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'm concerned about the possibility of diverticulitis. We need to rule that out quickly. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. And I’m also going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Diver… diverticulitis? Is that… serious? A CT scan… with contrast? I… I don't know much about any of this, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? I… I trust your judgment, of course. But it sounds… rather frightening. If you think it's necessary, then yes, please do what you think is best. But could you perhaps… explain it to me, in simple terms? I’m rather anxious now. Just tell me what it means, and what we're looking for. Please.
DOCTOR: Diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection in small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. They’re very common, especially as people get older. The symptoms – abdominal pain, especially in the lower left side, along with tenderness – are consistent with that possibility. A CT scan with contrast will allow us to see the colon more clearly and determine if there's inflammation, infection, or any complications, such as a perforation. It's not necessarily something to panic about, but it does require prompt diagnosis and treatment. The contrast is a dye that helps to visualize the colon better, and it's usually given intravenously. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh… that does sound a bit concerning, but thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. That makes it… less frightening, somehow. Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I've had scans before, haven’t I? Perhaps in the 2010s, for something else? I don’t recall any reaction, but my memory… well, you know. And kidney problems… I mentioned something about glomerulonephritis earlier. I was treated for that, years ago, and I’ve had regular check-ups. I don’t know if it’s still… a problem. I suppose I should have remembered, shouldn’t I? I apologize. Is there a way to find out? Perhaps your office has my records?
DOCTOR: Yes, the records indicate a history of glomerulonephritis in 2013, but recent kidney function tests from last year were within normal limits. However, given the history, we’ll need to check your creatinine level before administering the contrast dye, just to be safe. I'll order a blood test to check that. In the meantime, I want to start you on a clear liquid diet. No solid foods, just broth, clear juice, and water. That will give your colon a rest. And I’m going to prescribe an antibiotic, just in case it is diverticulitis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A clear liquid diet and an antibiotic. And checking my creatinine level first. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate you being so careful. It’s… comforting, knowing you’re taking everything seriously. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or avoiding? Besides the solid food, of course. And… will this involve a hospital stay? I do hope not. I prefer to be at home, if possible.
DOCTOR: We'll start with the antibiotics and clear liquid diet and see how you respond. A hospital stay isn't necessarily required at this point, but it depends on the results of the CT scan and how your symptoms progress. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. And, most importantly, if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or any blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to give you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Take it as directed. And I'll have the lab draw blood for the creatinine level right away. Once we have those results, we can proceed with the CT scan if it's safe. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A fever… blood in my stool… That does sound rather frightening. I'll certainly be careful, and I'll keep a very close eye on things. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I do appreciate your patience with me. And… thank you for taking the time to listen. It’s… a relief to finally have some answers, or at least a plan. I'll go to the lab and get the blood work done right away. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician is expecting you. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. Please call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms. And Ms. Glymph… try to rest. I will be in touch.
