DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… my joints, mostly. They’re just stiff when I wake up. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Not terrible, just… annoying, you know? Hard to get going in the mornings.
DOCTOR: Alright, stiff joints in the mornings. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… roughly? Hmm. It feels like… a long time. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? I lose track, you know? It comes and goes, not every single day. I work with the little ones, so I'm always moving, and sometimes I don't notice it as much then.
DOCTOR: Six months, give or take. And you said it's better when you're busy with work?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s right. When I’m playing with the children, running around, I don’t really think about it. It's when I stop that it bothers me. Like, first thing in the morning, or if I sit for too long. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a tightness, you know? Like an old hinge.
DOCTOR: An old hinge, okay. And where exactly are you feeling this tightness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, a little bit, I think. My hands, mostly. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too. It’s not… focused in one spot, if that makes sense? It's just… all over. It's hard to explain. I don't remember hurting myself or anything, it just sort of started.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generalized stiffness, hands, knees, shoulders… not related to any specific injury. Do you notice any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I don't think so? I mean, they don't look puffy, if that's what you mean. But I don't really pay attention to those things. I just know they feel stiff. Does swelling matter?
DOCTOR: It can give us some clues. Okay. And have you noticed any redness or warmth in those joints?
PATIENT: Redness…? Oh dear, I really don’t know. I haven’t… checked for that either. I’m sorry. I just know they’re stiff. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything, if that helps. No fever, no tiredness… just the stiffness. It’s just a little thing, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for this, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing at all. I don’t really take pills if I can avoid it. I try to just… push through it, you know? I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but the doctor said it was okay now. Nothing regular, though. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. That's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Let me think. I don't think so. I remember being allergic to something as a child, but I can’t recall what it was. Nothing that I've noticed as an adult, though. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I'm pretty good, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that's a hard one. My husband… he passed away a few years ago. He had some trouble with his heart, I think. And my mother… she had arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. But that was a long time ago. I don't really remember much about it, to be honest. We didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Alright, some heart trouble in your husband, arthritis in your mother. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history...? Oh dear. What does that mean? I work with the children, like I said. I enjoy that very much. I don't go out much anymore, not since… well, not since my husband passed. I mostly stay home and read. I don't smoke, and I don't drink very much. That's about it, I think. A quiet life. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. And do you do any regular exercise, besides working with the children?
PATIENT: Oh, well, running around with the little ones is exercise, isn't it? I don't go to the gym or anything. I used to walk more, but… I haven't been doing that much lately. I get tired easily, you know? It's just… easier to sit sometimes. I feel a bit bad saying that. I should be doing more. But the stiffness… it makes it hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Voner, it sounds like you've been dealing with this stiffness for quite some time. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A physical exam sounds good. Just… be gentle, if you would? My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, if you could just sit here on the exam table, and we'll start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Okay, I can do that. Oh, that’s a little… tight. It feels a bit stiff, you know? Like… clicking. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I feel some crepitus – that’s the clicking you’re describing – and some mild tenderness on the knuckles here. No significant swelling at this time. Now, let's check your wrists. Can you rotate them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it feels… tight. Like something's stuck. And… I think it's a little harder to move them than it used to be. It’s probably just old age, though. I used to be quite nimble, you know?
DOCTOR: Some mild restriction in range of motion. No significant warmth or swelling. Alright, let’s take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little… creaky. It feels like they’re grinding, you know? And it’s harder to get them all the way bent. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I don't think I can bend them as far as I used to. I used to be quite a gardener, you know, but I haven’t been doing much of that lately.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling some crepitus in both knees as well, and mild tenderness along the joint line. No significant swelling at this time. And finally, let's check the straight leg raise. That doesn’t elicit any pain. Alright, Ms. Voner. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some stiffness and mild crepitus in multiple joints – your hands, wrists, and knees. This is consistent with… likely osteoarthritis. It's a common condition, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Oh. Arthritis. Like my mother had? Is it… bad? Will I be stuck in a wheelchair? I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. It’s just… I want to keep playing with the little ones. I don’t want to slow down.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Voner. And it’s good you’re asking these questions. Osteoarthritis is different for everyone. It’s a degenerative condition, meaning it worsens over time, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll end up in a wheelchair. In your case, it appears to be mild to moderate, and we can definitely manage it to keep you active and playing with the children. We can start with some conservative treatments. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, to help with the discomfort. Physical therapy can also be very helpful to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. I can write you a prescription for physical therapy. We should also discuss some lifestyle modifications - maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding repetitive motions that aggravate the pain. To rule out other possibilities, and to get a clearer picture, I’d also like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your knees. The blood tests will help us rule out inflammatory arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis. The X-ray will show us the extent of the joint damage. Do that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests and an X-ray. That sounds… a bit scary. But… if it will help, I suppose. I don’t want to be a bother. And… I want to keep playing with the little ones, like you said. So, yes, I’ll do the tests. But… are they painful? And… will they take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Voner. The blood tests are very straightforward – just a small sample taken from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and there’s minimal discomfort, usually just a quick pinch. As for the X-ray, it’s completely painless – you’ll simply stand or lie still while the machine takes a picture of your knees. It takes just a few seconds. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will take care of everything. It shouldn’t take more than half an hour for both tests. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more detailed treatment plan. I'm going to write you a prescription for the physical therapy, and a lab order for the blood tests and X-ray. Before you go, do you have any questions about how to take the pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, pain relievers… I think I remember my husband taking something similar. Do they… make you sleepy? I need to be alert when I'm with the children. And… can I still take them with my… blood pressure medicine? I don't want to mix anything up.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Voner. It’s always important to be cautious with medications. The pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – can sometimes cause mild drowsiness in some people, but it’s not very common. It’s best to start with a low dose and see how you feel. More importantly, yes, it is possible they could interact with your blood pressure medication. I need to know exactly what blood pressure medication you are taking to give you accurate advice. Do you happen to know the name of it, or could you bring a list of your medications to the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh dear... I think it's a little white pill. With a number on it... but I can't remember the number. My daughter helps me with my pills, usually. I'll have to ask her. She's very good with those things. Yes, I'll bring a list to the next appointment. That's a good idea. I don’t want to mix anything up.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s the best course of action. Bring a list of all your medications, including the dosages, to the follow-up appointment, and we’ll make sure everything is safe. In the meantime, you can start with gentle exercises, like walking or stretching, to help keep your joints mobile. Avoid any activities that cause you pain, and remember to listen to your body. Here’s the prescription for physical therapy, and the lab order for the blood tests and X-ray. The lab technician will explain the process when you get there. Do you have any other questions for me before you go, Ms. Voner?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. And very patient with me. I do forget things so easily these days. Thank you for not rushing me. I'll bring the list to the next appointment, and I'll see you then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. Don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to the best of us. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Take your time getting to the lab, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
