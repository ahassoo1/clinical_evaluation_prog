DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather bothersome, to be frank. I seem to be going to the restroom… a great deal. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have someone take a look. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it once was, so pinpointing exactly when it started is… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. Increased urinary frequency. And you said “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. A little while. Perhaps… a month or so? It feels like that, at least. It's not painful, thankfully, just… inconvenient. And quite disruptive, if I'm being honest. I’ve been trying to keep track, but as I mentioned, remembering details is proving… challenging. Do you need a more precise timeframe? I wish I could be of more help.
DOCTOR: A month is… broad. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. I don’t believe so. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. The colour seems… standard. Perhaps a little lighter than usual, now that you mention it. But I wouldn’t say it’s dramatically different. Is that important? I confess, I rarely pay close attention to such things.
DOCTOR: Lighter urine can indicate something, yes. And any blood?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Definitely no blood. That would be… alarming, wouldn't it? I assure you, Doctor, it's just… a lot of it. And frequently. I've been trying to reduce my fluid intake, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. It’s… perplexing. I haven't changed my diet recently, nor have I started any new medications.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder each time?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think so, yes. I try to be thorough, if you understand. But… it’s difficult to be certain, isn’t it? Sometimes I feel as though there might be a little… residual left behind, but perhaps that’s just my imagination. It’s hard to say, really. I haven't actively tried to measure it, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And thankfully, no pain in my back or side. I'm generally quite healthy, Doctor, despite my… lapses in memory. It’s just this constant need to visit the restroom. It’s rather disruptive to my… hobbies, shall we say. I enjoy birdwatching, but it requires a certain amount of… uninterrupted time. And this makes that difficult. Do you think it could be something serious? I’m trying not to worry, but…
DOCTOR: It’s likely just an overactive bladder. Common at your age. We’ll need to rule a few things out, though. I’ll order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. And we'll do a quick physical exam. Just to be thorough, of course.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A urinalysis and a panel… very thorough. And an exam, of course. I appreciate your… diligence. Will the tests require much of my time? I have a rather… busy schedule, though it’s mostly filled with birdwatching these days. And, if you don’t mind my asking, what exactly are we… ruling out? I always feel better when I understand what’s happening, even if my memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis is quick, just a sample. The panel is bloodwork, so it will take a bit longer. We’re ruling out infection, diabetes, and kidney problems. Standard procedure. Now, if you’ll just follow me, we can get the exam done. It’s just a brief check. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Infection, diabetes, kidney problems… I understand. Bloodwork and a simple check. Very well. Lead the way. I trust it won’t be too… unpleasant? I confess, I'm not particularly fond of medical examinations, but I understand they are necessary. And I do appreciate you taking the time to investigate this matter. I shall lie down on the table, as you suggest.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and feel for any tenderness. Try to relax. Now, breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Very well. I shall attempt to relax, Doctor. Though my mind does tend to wander. Deep breath… as you say. Is there anything specific I should be feeling for? Or is it simply a matter of… passively allowing you to examine me? I apologize if I seem… inquisitive. I merely wish to be a cooperative patient.
DOCTOR: Good. Relax. Abdomen is soft, no masses. I don’t feel any tenderness. Reflexes seem normal. Now, can you tell me if you have any difficulty starting or stopping your urine stream?
PATIENT: A little… startling, that was. But no lasting discomfort. Difficulty starting or stopping… hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. I suppose… occasionally. Not consistently, but sometimes it takes a moment to… initiate the stream. And occasionally, it sputters a bit at the end. But I attributed that to… well, simply getting older. It hasn't been a major concern, honestly. Is that significant? Perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier. I apologize for the oversight.
DOCTOR: Hesitation and sputtering can be indicative of prostate issues. It's common at your age, as you said. But we need to rule out other causes. We'll get the lab results back in a few days. I'll call you then. Don’t worry too much. It’s likely nothing serious. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Prostate issues… I see. Yes, I suppose that is… plausible. Lab results in a few days… very well. I understand you are busy, Doctor. I shall await your call. Thank you for your time, and for… investigating this matter. And if I recall anything else… should I contact you? Or simply wait for your call? I apologize again for any… inconvenience I may have caused.
DOCTOR: Wait for my call. Don't bother me unless it's an emergency. Next!
