DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do small talk. I just… want to make sure everything’s okay, you know? I want to get pregnant, and I want it to happen now. My husband… well, he passed, and I don't want to waste time. Is that enough information, or do you need a whole life story?
DOCTOR: While I understand your desire for expediency, Ms. Villarreal, a comprehensive understanding of your medical history is crucial for ensuring the best possible outcome. It’s not about wanting a “life story,” but rather gathering pertinent information. However, we can certainly focus on the factors relevant to your goal of pregnancy. Since you mentioned the recent loss of your husband, I do extend my sincerest condolences. Grief can significantly impact one’s health, and it’s important to acknowledge that. Let’s start with this: Have you been trying to conceive for a specific period of time?
PATIENT: Look, grief is… grief. It happens. I’m trying to move on, not rehash everything. And no, I haven’t been “trying” for any specific period. I just… stopped taking precautions, and it’s not happening. It should be simple, right? I was always regular before. Healthy, too. Honestly, I don’t understand what the hold-up is. I have good insurance, so I figured I'd just get it checked out. Is that what you need to know? How regular I was? It's been a few months, okay? A few.
DOCTOR: “A few months” is rather vague, Ms. Villarreal. While I appreciate your desire to be concise, precise timing is important when evaluating potential fertility concerns. It is generally recommended to seek evaluation after six months of unprotected intercourse if you are over the age of 35, and after one year if you are younger. You are 43, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 43. And look, I don’t need a lecture on timelines. I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me. Is that so hard to understand? I didn’t come here for a history lesson. Can we just… do some tests? Or do I need to list every single period I've ever had? Because frankly, I'm busy.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I assure you, I am not attempting to provide a “lecture.” However, a proper evaluation requires more than simply ordering tests. We need to understand why conception may not be occurring. Randomly performing tests without context is rarely productive – and can be expensive. Let’s try this. Apart from stopping birth control, have you made any other lifestyle changes recently?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? What are you getting at? I eat reasonably well. I don’t smoke. I walk, sometimes. I haven’t… I haven’t changed anything drastically. Look, I’m a food science technician, okay? I know about healthy eating. Are you suggesting I’m… unhealthy? This is ridiculous. I just want to know if I need help. And honestly, you're starting to irritate me.
DOCTOR: I am not implying you are unhealthy, Ms. Villarreal. I am simply gathering information. Certain factors – even seemingly minor ones – can impact fertility. Diet, stress levels, exercise… these all play a role. Given your profession, you likely have a good understanding of nutritional impacts. But let’s move on. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes. One. Years ago. It was… complicated. I don’t really want to talk about it. It ended… badly. Look, is this really necessary? I just want to know if my… everything is still working properly. Can't you just check that? Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is all very… intrusive. And frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if my questions are causing you distress. However, a history of a complicated pregnancy is relevant information. It’s crucial to understand what occurred previously to ensure we are providing the most appropriate care. While I respect your desire for privacy, withholding information can hinder our ability to accurately assess your situation. Before we proceed further, would you be willing to at least tell me the type of complication you experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. It was… a miscarriage. Early on. It was… traumatic. And I don't want to relive it, okay? It happened a long time ago. I don't see what that has to do with anything now. I just want a baby. Can we just get to the tests already? This is ridiculous. Are you going to help me, or just keep asking questions? I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your frustration, and I will proceed with ordering some initial tests. However, I want to be clear: these tests are just a starting point. They will provide us with some baseline information, but they may not provide a definitive answer. We will need to assess your hormone levels, check your uterine anatomy with a transvaginal ultrasound, and evaluate your husband's sperm count. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Husband? What husband? I told you, he passed. I don't have a husband. I'm… I'm using a donor. Is that a problem? Honestly, this is getting more and more ridiculous. Are you even listening to me? And no, I don't have any allergies. Can we please just get this over with? I need a referral to a sperm bank, and I need those tests done. Now.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Villarreal. I seem to be having some difficulty keeping track of the details of your history. That is entirely my fault. Yes, of course. Using donor sperm does change things. We will need to ensure the donor meets certain criteria and that we have all the necessary documentation. Let's proceed with the initial tests. I will order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a follicle-stimulating hormone level to assess your ovarian reserve. We will also need a transvaginal ultrasound to evaluate your uterus and ovaries. I will also provide you with a requisition form for a semen analysis for the donor, along with a list of reputable sperm banks in the area. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the forms. And a referral. I don't want to sit here answering more questions. Honestly, this has been a waste of time. I just want to get this done. Is that too much to ask? I have a schedule, you know. And frankly, I'm losing patience.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The requisition forms for the blood work and the ultrasound are included, as well as the list of sperm banks. I have also included a referral form for a reproductive endocrinologist. They are specialists in fertility and may be better equipped to address your specific concerns. The lab is located on the third floor, and the imaging center is just across the street. Please schedule those appointments at your earliest convenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, there isn’t. Just… thank you. I guess. I’m going to go.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Villarreal. I wish you the best of luck. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: .
