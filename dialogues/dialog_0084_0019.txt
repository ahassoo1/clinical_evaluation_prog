DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Carlotta is my name, yes. My wife… she wants a baby. We are… older now. I think we need to talk about… making that happen? I don't know the words, sorry. It is… a plan, yes? A good plan.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, I understand. You and your wife are hoping to start a family. That’s wonderful. And it’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure how to phrase things – we can work through this together. When you say “making that happen,” are you thinking about trying to conceive naturally, or have you already started looking into options like assisted reproductive technology?
PATIENT: Ah… conceive. Yes, that is the word. We have not… started. Just thinking. My wife, she reads things… on the computer. About… help. For older people. I don't understand much of it. Is that… the assisted… thing? It sounds… complicated. We just want to know if it is… possible, you know? For us. Is that okay to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Carlotta. It’s always okay to ask. And yes, when your wife is reading about “help,” she’s likely finding information about assisted reproductive technologies, or ART. It can be complicated, you're right. Before we talk about those options, let’s just gather some information. It’s good to have a full picture. I'd like to ask you both a few questions about your medical history, and your wife's as well. This will help me understand if ART is a good fit, or if there are other things we should consider first. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical… I have… my back. Old back. Hurts sometimes. And… I take a pill for my blood pressure. Small pill. That is all, I think. My wife… she is healthy, mostly. She has… sometimes she feels tired. But that is just… getting older, no? She sees a doctor for that sometimes. She will know more about the… details. She remembers things better than me, sorry. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good start, Mr. Carlotta. Back pain and blood pressure medication – we’ll definitely want to get the name of that medication. And good to know your wife sees a doctor regularly for fatigue. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me the name of the blood pressure medication you take?
PATIENT: Ah… the name. Yes. It is… a white pill. Small. I think… Lisinopril? Is that right? My wife gets it for me. She keeps the bottles. I don't… look at the names very closely. Sorry. It’s been a long time taking it. I think it starts with an 'L'. Is that enough? It helps my blood, yes.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes, that’s helpful. We’ll make a note of that. It's perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details - that’s what we’re here for. Now, has either of you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I broke my arm when I was young. A long time ago. They fixed it. That is all I remember. My wife… she had her tonsils out when she was little. That is what she tells me, anyway. She had a… problem with her stomach once, but that was many years ago. They gave her some medicine. She was in the hospital for a few days. But she is fine now. Mostly. Is that enough details? I am sorry I cannot remember more.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Broken arm for you, tonsillectomy and a past stomach issue for your wife – we’re building a good picture. Just a few more questions, then we can talk about possibilities. Have either of you been diagnosed with any chronic health conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… chronic… those are big words. My wife… sometimes her blood sugar is a little high. The doctor told her to eat less sugar. She tries. I think she has… pre-diabetes, maybe? She says that is what the doctor called it. I… I don't have anything. My blood pressure is the only thing. Sometimes it goes up, sometimes it goes down. That is all. Is that enough? I am trying to remember everything. Sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Mr. Carlotta. Pre-diabetes for your wife and managed blood pressure for you. That’s very helpful information. Now, before we talk about options for starting a family, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyles – things like diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol use. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ah… lifestyle. Yes. We try to eat healthy. Fish, vegetables… My wife cooks good food. We don't eat much meat. Exercise… I walk sometimes. Short walks. My wife likes to garden. That is good exercise, I think. Smoking… no. Never smoked. Alcohol… sometimes we have a small glass of wine with dinner. Just one glass. Maybe two if it is a special occasion. Is that enough? We try to be good, you know? Old people need to be careful.
DOCTOR: That sounds very healthy, Mr. Carlotta. A good diet, regular activity, and moderate alcohol use – that’s all excellent. Okay, one final set of questions before we move on. I’d like to ask about your family history – if you know of any significant medical conditions that run in either of your families. Things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer… anything like that.
PATIENT: Ah… family history. That is… hard. My family… they lived far away. Somalia. I don't know much about their health. They didn't… go to doctors much. My wife’s family… her mother had… a problem with her heart. She died when she was young. And her father had… diabetes, I think. He lost his leg. That is what I remember. Mostly. Is that enough? It was a long time ago. I am sorry I don’t know more details. It makes me sad to think about.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s understandable that remembering family history can be difficult, especially when loved ones lived far away. Knowing about your wife’s mother’s heart condition and father’s diabetes is helpful. And it’s alright to feel sad thinking about it. Okay, so let’s summarize what we have so far. You have managed blood pressure, a history of a broken arm, and your wife has pre-diabetes, a past stomach issue, and a family history of heart disease and diabetes. You both have healthy lifestyles overall. Now, given your ages and this information, starting a family naturally might be more challenging. However, there are options we can explore, like assisted reproductive technologies. Before we go into those, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Assisted… technologies. That sounds… complicated and expensive. I am worried about that. And… is it safe? For my wife? She is not young anymore. I don’t want to… cause her problems. What are the… options, exactly? And what do they… involve? Maybe we should just… forget about it. It is probably too late, anyway. But my wife… she really wants a baby. She talks about it all the time. I just want to know what is possible, and what the… risks are. And… how much it will cost. Sorry for all the questions.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Mr. Carlotta, and I’m glad you're asking them. It's absolutely right to be concerned about safety, cost, and what’s involved. Let's address them one by one. Assisted reproductive technologies can be complicated, but we can break it down. The most common option, and the one we would likely start with, is In Vitro Fertilization, or IVF. That involves retrieving eggs from your wife, fertilizing them with your sperm in a lab, and then transferring the resulting embryo back into her uterus. There are other options, but IVF is often the most successful for older patients. As for risks, there are some. It can involve some hormonal treatments for your wife which can have side effects, and there is a small risk of complications with the egg retrieval process. We'd discuss those risks in detail and monitor her closely throughout the process. Regarding cost… it is significant. A single IVF cycle can cost anywhere from $12,000 to $15,000, and often multiple cycles are needed. Insurance coverage can vary. I’ll have my staff provide you with detailed cost estimates and information on financing options. Before we proceed, I recommend we do some basic fertility testing for both of you to assess your chances of success and guide our approach. That would involve blood tests and a transvaginal ultrasound for your wife. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Transvaginal… that sounds… private. My wife… she might not like that. But… testing sounds good. To know if it is… possible. And to know… the chances. If the chances are… very small, maybe we should not… bother. It would be… too much stress for my wife. And too expensive. Yes. Testing first. That sounds… best. And… could we talk to my wife… together? I want her to… hear the information directly from you. I am not good at… remembering everything. And she is better at… asking questions. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. That’s a very good idea. We can absolutely schedule a joint appointment so I can discuss the testing and options with both of you together. We'll take all the time you need, and I'll answer all your questions as thoroughly as possible. And yes, the transvaginal ultrasound is a bit more personal, but it's a very important part of the evaluation. It allows us to assess your wife’s uterus and ovaries. We'll explain the procedure in detail and ensure she's comfortable throughout. Let me have my staff schedule that appointment for you both. Would next week work?
PATIENT: Next week… yes, that is good. My wife… she has gardening club on Tuesdays. And… she likes to go to the market on Fridays. Wednesday or Thursday… those would be good. Any time… except in the morning. She likes to sleep late. Sorry. She is an old woman. But she is a good woman. She makes good food. And she wants a baby. I… I just want to make her happy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wednesday or Thursday afternoon it is. My staff will contact you to confirm a specific time. And don't apologize – it's perfectly normal to have a routine, and it’s important to work around that. I understand you want to make your wife happy, Mr. Carlotta, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll go through everything step by step, and make sure you both feel comfortable and informed. Thank you for coming in today. We'll see you both next week.
