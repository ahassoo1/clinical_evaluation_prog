DOCTOR: Alright, Keoni, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Osterholm. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I’ve been needing to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, I think. It’s just… frequent. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. Things have been a little… hazy recently.
DOCTOR: Hazy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sorry. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began. Just… a general sense of things being a little unclear. As for the bathroom trips… it’s not painful, just… inconvenient. And a bit worrying, naturally. I find myself going quite often throughout the day, and even waking up a couple of times at night. I don't recall any fever or chills, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination, no pain, waking up at night… and you're having some… memory issues. Anything else?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I've been drinking a lot more water than usual, I suppose. Trying to, anyway. I read somewhere that it helps… but perhaps that’s just making things worse? I truly don’t know. And… I’ve felt a bit tired lately. Not constantly exhausted, but just… lower energy than I’m used to. It’s all rather frustrating, Doctor. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Vague is… not ideal, Keoni. It makes things difficult. Are you experiencing any increased thirst alongside all this increased urination?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's right. Increased thirst. Quite a lot of it, actually. I'm constantly reaching for water, even when I don't necessarily feel thirsty. It’s almost like I can’t get enough. It’s… it's almost like a constant dryness in my mouth. Does that make any sense? I do apologize again for the lack of specifics. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased thirst, frequent urination, waking at night… Let’s try to get a bit more of a picture here. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. My appetite feels… normal, I suppose. I haven’t been particularly hungry or lacking an appetite, if that makes sense. I’ve been eating… well, probably not the healthiest things, to be honest. A bit of convenience food mostly. But I haven't noticed any significant changes there. Is that helpful at all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's… something. Let's move on. Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nausea, no vomiting, and no abdominal pain. Everything feels… normal in that regard. Just the constant need to go to the bathroom, and the thirst. It’s just… disruptive. I haven’t been sleeping well, and I’m finding it difficult to concentrate at work. I'm a concierge, you see, so I really need to be on my toes. It's beginning to worry me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Concierge, right. Requires a certain… alertness. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… oh, dear. I hadn't even thought about that. Let me see… I don't think so. Everything seems… blurry sometimes, but I just assumed that was my glasses needing an adjustment. I haven't noticed anything drastically different. Is that something I should be concerned about? Perhaps I should book an eye exam, too? I truly apologize for not being more observant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision could be relevant. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I've never had a reaction to anything. Oh, but… I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter. It knocked me around for a good week. But I recovered fully, I believe. Just a bit tired afterwards, as one usually is. Please do proceed with the examination, Doctor. I trust your judgement implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and another… Good. Heart sounds are… normal. Lungs are clear. Now, reflexes… Your reflexes are a little sluggish. Which isn’t unexpected, given everything. Now, I'd like to take a urine sample. Can you step into the bathroom and collect one for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A urine sample, of course. Yes, that makes perfect sense. I’ll be right back. Please let me know if you need anything at all. .
DOCTOR: Sluggish reflexes… frequent urination… thirsty… hazy… Good. Let's get this sent to the lab. This will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
