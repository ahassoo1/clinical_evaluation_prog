DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez, but please, call me Valerie. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Valerie, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I’ve just been having these chills, you know? Not like a fever chill, but just…cold. It's been going on for a couple of days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a couple of days. And just to clarify, you haven't had a fever with these chills?
PATIENT: No, no fever. That’s what’s weird. I checked my temperature a couple of times, and it’s normal. Just…shivering, even when I don't feel cold, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And where are you feeling these chills most prominently?
PATIENT: Hmm…it’s hard to say exactly. It’s not like one specific spot. I think mostly in my back and arms, but it kind of comes and goes all over, really. Like waves. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, waves all over, mostly in your back and arms. Have you noticed anything else accompanying these chills?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really. I’ve been a little tired, I guess, but I mean, who isn’t these days? And maybe a tiny bit achy, but nothing major. It's not like the flu, definitely. I'm just... off.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little tired and some minor aches. And you feel generally “off.” Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or sleep recently?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. My appetite’s been a bit low, I haven't been very hungry. And I've been waking up a few times in the night, but I thought that was just stress. Things have been a bit hectic lately with… well, everything. Divorces, you know? It's not easy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can definitely disrupt sleep and appetite. Okay, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And I broke my arm once, but nothing serious. I’m pretty healthy otherwise, I think. No chronic conditions or anything like that. I usually just get the occasional cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, broken arm, and generally healthy. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years and never had a reaction. Wait... actually, I think I was a little itchy after taking penicillin once, years ago. But it wasn't a bad reaction, just a little bit of hives, I think. I haven't taken it since.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible mild reaction to penicillin in the past – hives. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And I take ibuprofen occasionally if I have a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regularly or anything. I try to stay away from meds if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And before we move on, do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but that was later in life. And my grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis, I think. But that’s about all I know, really. We don't talk about health stuff a lot in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis. Thanks for sharing that. Now, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a health education specialist, so I should be healthy, right? I try to eat pretty well – lots of vegetables, lean protein – but sometimes it’s hard with my schedule. I don't exercise as much as I should, I’ll admit that. I walk a lot, just getting around, but no gym or anything. And I don’t drink or smoke. I used to go out a lot more, but… not so much now.
DOCTOR: Okay, health education specialist, healthy diet, moderate exercise, no smoking or drinking. That gives me a good sense. Alright, before we do a quick physical exam, just one last thing. Are you sexually active, and if so, are you using any form of protection?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, I am. And yes, I always use protection. It's… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you for being open. Now, let's just do a quick exam, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me, in and out… Everything sounds clear there. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be related to the chills or just anxiety. Now, let me check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Okay, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, pulse is 80, and blood pressure is 120/80. Still a little elevated, but within normal limits. Let’s just feel your lymph nodes… No swelling there. And lastly, I'll quickly examine your throat… Say "Ahhh" for me. Throat looks clear. Everything appears normal on the initial exam. Given your symptoms – chills, fatigue, low appetite, and a bit of anxiety – and the normal physical exam findings, a couple of things come to mind. It could be a mild viral infection, although you don't have a fever. Another possibility is stress-related illness, especially with everything you’ve been going through. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . This will help us check for infection, inflammation, and any underlying imbalances. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood work seems sensible. I mean, I just want to know what's going on, you know? It's just… unsettling feeling off like this. So, CBC and CMP, right? Is that going to be expensive? I do have private insurance, but…
DOCTOR: Yes, CBC and CMP. And I understand your concern about cost. Let me check what your insurance covers. Okay, it looks like your insurance will cover the majority of the cost. You should have a copay of $30 for the lab work. We can get those labs drawn right here in the clinic. It will just take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I'm going to give you some recommendations for managing your symptoms. First, prioritize rest. Get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids – water, herbal tea, broth. And try to eat small, nutritious meals throughout the day, even if you don’t feel very hungry. For the anxiety, have you considered any stress-reduction techniques?
PATIENT: Okay, $30 is manageable, thankfully. And yeah, rest, fluids, small meals… I can definitely do that. Honestly, I've been meaning to get more sleep for ages. Stress reduction… um, not really. I try to distract myself, I guess. Watch TV, read… I used to do yoga, but I haven't done that in a while. I'm just so busy, it's hard to find the time. It feels like a vicious cycle, you know? Stressed out, tired, can't relax… and then even more stressed out.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s easy to get caught in that cycle. Even small changes can make a difference. Have you ever tried mindfulness exercises or deep breathing techniques?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Mindfulness… that sounds a bit… out there, to be honest. I'm not really one for meditation or anything. Deep breathing, maybe? I mean, I know of it, but I’ve never really tried it seriously. It feels… silly, I guess. Like it wouldn’t actually do anything.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t feel silly at all. It’s actually a very effective way to calm your nervous system. It’s simple – just focus on your breath, and notice the sensations of each inhale and exhale. There are lots of free guided meditations online or apps you could try. I can send you some links if you’d like?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be great, actually. Links would be helpful. I mean, I’m willing to try anything at this point. If it helps me sleep, I'm up for it. Thanks, Valerie. You’re making me feel a bit better just talking about it. I really appreciate you not dismissing my worries. Some doctors just tell you to “de-stress” and send you home.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. That’s what I’m here for. Here, I've sent those to your phone. Take a look when you have a moment. Okay, the lab results are back. Everything looks pretty normal, thankfully. Your white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which could indicate a mild viral infection, but it’s not significant. Your electrolytes are balanced, and your liver and kidney function are normal. Based on these results, it’s most likely a mild viral illness, exacerbated by stress. We can treat the symptoms as they arise – rest, fluids, over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. I'm going to recommend that you follow up with me in a week if your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out sooner if you develop a high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A mild virus… I can deal with that. Rest, fluids, and see you in a week if it doesn’t get better. That's… reassuring, actually. Thank you, Valerie. Really. You've been great. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. And the links for the meditations… I’ll definitely give them a try. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Remember, prioritizing your well-being is important, especially with everything you’re going through. Take care of yourself, and please reach out if you need anything. Have a good day. .
