DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer, good to meet you. August 2nd...right. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s my foot. It’s been…bothering me. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won't get better. It hurts to walk, even just around the house.
DOCTOR: Alright, a sore on your foot…and it’s making it difficult to walk. Hmm. How long has this sore been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it’s been…maybe two, three months now? It started small, I thought it was just a little scratch from my slippers, but it just…stayed. And got bigger. It doesn’t heal.
DOCTOR: Two or three months…and it hasn’t healed despite resting. Okay. Is it painful constantly, or does the pain come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, yes. It’s not a sharp pain all the time, more of a dull ache. But when I try to walk…or even just stand for too long…it gets worse. Much worse. Like a fire is inside it.
DOCTOR: A dull ache most of the time, worsens with walking… and you describe it as a burning sensation. Okay. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. There is redness, around the edges. And sometimes…sometimes I see a little…something. A little wetness, you know? Not a lot, but…something coming out. It’s not…clean, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Redness and some discharge… okay. Have you tried anything at all to treat it yourself?
PATIENT: Well, my daughter, Leilani, she told me to keep it clean. I wash it with soap and water, like she said. And I tried some of that…ointment she gave me, for cuts. But it didn’t seem to help. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Soap and water, and an over-the-counter ointment… alright. Do you have any other medical conditions, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor…a different doctor, some years ago, he told me I have the sugar sickness. You know, the diabetes. I take pills for it, every day. And…I don’t remember the name of the pills. They’re little white ones.
DOCTOR: Diabetes… okay. And you take little white pills daily. Let me see if I can pull up your records here… Aha, yes. Metformin. You're on 500mg twice a day. Good. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good, you know about the pills! Yes, metformin…that’s right. And allergies…hmm. No, I don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything the doctors gave me. Not that I remember, anyway. Leilani would know for sure.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. Now, I'm going to take a look at your foot, if that's alright with you. Just need you to sit back and let me examine it. I’ll need to take a closer look at the sore.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Please, do. It’s been worrying me, you see. I'll sit right here. Be careful, it’s a little tender.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore here…it's on the bottom of your foot. There’s redness around it, and some swelling. The skin around it is a little warm to the touch. I’m also noticing some loss of sensation in the area. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t feel that. Just a…a little pressure, maybe. But not the…prick you’re trying. My daughter says my feet are…sleepy sometimes. That’s what she calls it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Loss of sensation, combined with the diabetes, redness, swelling, and discharge…this is concerning, Mr. Stoegbauer. It could be an infection. We need to rule that out. I’m going to order a blood test to check your blood sugar and look for signs of infection. We might also need to get an X-ray to see if the infection has affected the bone. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An infection? That doesn't sound good. Yes, yes, do what you think is best, Doctor. If it needs a test…or a picture…do it. I just want this sore to get better. Is it…serious?
DOCTOR: It’s potentially serious, yes. Diabetes can make it harder for your body to fight off infections, and infections in the feet can sometimes spread. But we’re going to figure out what’s going on and get you the treatment you need. We'll start with these tests and go from there. I'm also going to recommend you see a podiatrist—a foot specialist—as soon as possible. Would you like me to help schedule that appointment for you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A specialist…yes, please, if you wouldn't mind. Leilani always says I forget things. I wouldn’t know where to start. And thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. So, blood test…and a picture…and a foot doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled you an appointment with Dr. Nakamura for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. They’re located just down the street here, at 123 Main Street. I’m also going to have the nurse draw some blood for those tests. And I'm going to prescribe a course of antibiotics to start while we await the results. The nurse will go over the instructions with you. In the meantime, please try to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Antibiotics…yes, that sounds good. Tuesday at 10…I think I can manage that. Keep weight off my foot…that will be difficult. Hmm…let me think. Yes…what will happen if the picture shows…something bad? If it's in the bone?
DOCTOR: If the X-ray shows the infection has affected the bone, it’s more serious, yes. It might require a longer course of antibiotics, or potentially even a procedure to remove any infected tissue. But we won’t know until we get the results of the X-ray. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, and I’ll explain everything in detail at that point. It’s important to remember that we’re catching this early, and that gives us a better chance of successful treatment. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and getting you started on the antibiotics. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes…catch it early…that’s good. That makes me feel a little better. I understand. Tests…and the pills. And see the foot doctor on Tuesday. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the antibiotic instructions. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment on Tuesday. I’ll also review the results with you as soon as they come in. .
