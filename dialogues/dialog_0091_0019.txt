DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? My wife… she want baby. We… old now. She say maybe need help. I not sure what help is, but she say come here. Is for that. We want… family grow.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife is hoping to start or expand your family, and she’s suggested a consultation to explore options. That’s perfectly reasonable. To help me understand your situation better, and to ensure we explore all appropriate avenues, could you tell me a bit more about your and your wife’s medical histories?
PATIENT: Medical… histories? Oh dear. Is long time ago. I… I think I okay. No big problems. I work with metal, plastic… small things. Hands good. I go to doctor sometimes for… aches and pains. Old man things. My wife… she have doctor she see. Always see doctor. I think she is… healthy too. But I forget. So many years. We have Medicare, you know?
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Mr. Carlotta. We can take things slowly. Knowing you both are generally healthy is a good starting point. And yes, I see you have Medicare coverage. To clarify, when you say you see a doctor for aches and pains, are those related to your work with metal and plastic, or are they more general?
PATIENT: Little bit both, I think. Work… make hands stiff. Sometimes back ache. But I old, you know? I not work so hard now. Mostly small things. My wife… she tell me to go see doctor when I complain too much. She worry. I think she worry more than I do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've managed these aches and pains for some time, and your wife is understandably attentive to your well-being. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I ask a few more specific questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Ask questions. I try to remember. Is okay. Long time ago. But ask. Maybe she told me things I forget.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with any major illnesses or surgeries you may have had in the past. Do you recall any significant medical conditions you've been treated for, such as heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… heart… I think not. Doctor checked it once, long time ago. Said was okay. Diabetes? No. I like sweet things, but… no diabetes. High… high blood… pressure? Maybe. She say I get angry sometimes. Little bit angry. But she give me pills for it. Yellow pills. I take them sometimes, when I remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Carlotta. So, you recall being told you have high blood pressure and are currently taking yellow pills for it, though not always consistently. Do you happen to know the name of those pills?
PATIENT: No, no. I not know name. She get them for me. From the… pharmacy. Little bottle. Yellow pills. That is all I know. I just take them when she tell me. She good with names. I forget everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly look into that. And it is very common to forget medication names. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason, or had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospital… No. Never hospital. Too much… noise. I not like noise. Surgeries… No, no surgeries. I break my arm when I was young boy, climbing tree. But they just… put in cast. No surgery. Just cast. Long time ago. Very long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the yellow pills for blood pressure?
PATIENT: No… no other pills. Sometimes, when my knee hurt, I take… something. White pill. But only when it hurt very bad. She give me that too. For the knee. But not every day. Just… when it hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you take yellow pills for blood pressure when you remember, and white pills for knee pain as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. She worry about me eating too much sugar, but… no allergies. Never had allergy. I see dust when I work with metal, but not allergy. Just… sneeze a little.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Mr. Carlotta. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. Is very long time ago. My… my father, he had… trouble with his heart. Old man trouble. But he lived long time. My mother… she had… aches and pains. Like me. But she was strong woman. Lots of children. I not remember… anything else. Is very long ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s common for details to be forgotten over time. Knowing that your father had heart trouble and your mother experienced aches and pains is helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I sit. Mostly sit. I make small things, you know? Metal things, plastic things. I drink tea. Lots of tea. Sometimes, I walk a little. To the market. But not much walking. My wife… she does all the work. She is very strong woman. Very busy. I watch television.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you enjoy a relatively relaxed lifestyle. Do you currently use any tobacco products, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no tobacco! Never tobacco. Bad for you. My wife… she would kill me if I smoke! Alcohol… Sometimes, very little wine. With dinner. But not every day. Maybe once a week. Small glass. Just for taste.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. Now, before we discuss your wife’s desire to start a family, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical… examination? Hmm. Okay. If you think is good. But… not too much poking, please? My bones get old, you know. Just… gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. I'll also take a look at your knees, given that you mentioned some discomfort. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds… okay. But… no surprises, please? And… if it hurt, I will tell you. I not want to be polite and suffer in silence.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. Your comfort is my priority. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It’s likely influenced by being in a clinical setting. Your heart sounds good – regular rhythm, no unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Your abdomen is soft and doesn't appear to be tender to the touch. Now, your knees do have some crepitus, which is common with aging, and some mild swelling. You do seem to experience some discomfort with full flexion. Overall, your examination findings are generally within normal limits for your age, although the elevated blood pressure and knee discomfort warrant some attention. Do you have any questions about what I've found so far?
PATIENT: Knee… is always trouble. But I live with it. Blood pressure… is that bad? My wife… she worry about everything. Is that too much worry? She say I need to… take care of myself. But I not sure what that mean.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a bit higher than we’d ideally like, Mr. Carlotta, but it’s not drastically elevated, and it could be due to being in the clinic. However, it’s important to monitor it regularly. We can discuss strategies for managing it, such as diet and exercise, and if needed, medication. As for what “taking care of yourself” means, it’s about making small, sustainable changes to improve your overall health and well-being. This can include things like eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, managing stress, and getting enough sleep. Now, let's talk about your wife’s desire to start a family. To do that effectively, I'd need to gather some information about her medical history as well. Do you have access to her medical records, or do you know which doctor she sees?
PATIENT: She have doctor… Dr. Amina Patel. She see her for everything. I not have her records. She keep them. But I know she is… healthy. She very strong woman. Always busy. Always taking care of everyone else. She want baby… but she old too. That is why she want help, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very reasonable consideration. It’s good to know your wife is generally healthy, but age can be a factor in fertility. To get a better understanding of the options available, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to gather some information about both your and your wife’s reproductive histories. Mr. Carlotta, have you ever had any children?
PATIENT: No. Never. We… try long time ago. But… nothing happen. We not talk about it much. Is sad thing. My wife… she very disappointed. We move on. But she always want family. Is why she come here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. That must have been difficult for both of you. It's admirable that you're both exploring options now. Now, to proceed, I’d like to schedule an appointment for your wife to come in as well, so I can get a comprehensive medical history and discuss potential fertility treatments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Schedule appointment for my wife. She is… busy woman. Need to find time. But yes. Schedule appointment. Is good. Maybe… maybe this time will be different.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have my assistant reach out to your wife to find a convenient time. To summarize, we’ve discussed your medical history, performed a brief physical examination, and agreed to schedule an appointment for your wife. I’ll also order some routine blood work for both of you to assess your overall health and reproductive function. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No… I think is good. You very kind, Doctor. You listen to me. That is good. I hope… I hope you can help us. That is all I want. Thank you.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Carlotta. I'm glad I could listen, and I will certainly do my best to help you and your wife. We will review the results of the blood work and discuss all available options during your wife’s appointment. Here’s some information about the clinic, including our contact number. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your wife’s appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You very good doctor. Goodbye.
