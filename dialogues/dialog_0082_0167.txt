DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my foot. It’s been…troubling me lately. A sore, really. A bad one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. A sore on your foot. Okay. And how long has this sore been troubling you?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It’s been… maybe three, four weeks now? It started small, just a little red spot. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it just…didn’t get better. It got bigger, and now it hurts to walk. A lot. I have the…sugar sickness, you know? The doctor told me about it a long time ago. Does that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Emiliano, that’s good information to have. Diabetes, or “sugar sickness” as you call it, can certainly affect your feet. It can make it harder for wounds to heal, and increase the risk of infection. Three or four weeks…and it’s gotten bigger and more painful. Can you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: It’s… on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my heel. It’s…roundish, I suppose. And deep. Not just a scratch. It’s red around the edges, and kind of…pale in the middle. And it… well, it smells a little bad. I’m sorry to say. I try to keep it clean, but… it's hard. I'm an old man, you know? Things aren't as easy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It’s perfectly alright to be honest with me. And it's good you're keeping it as clean as you can. A sore on the bottom of the heel, red around the edges, pale in the middle… and an odor. That does sound concerning, especially with your history of diabetes. Let me take a look, if you don’t mind. We'll need to assess it properly. Can you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. It’s just… cold feet, you know? Being an old man has its drawbacks. Here, let me… There it is. Sorry it's not a pretty sight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Emiliano. I see it. It's approximately… two centimeters in diameter, with some exposed tissue. There's some redness and swelling around the edges, and a small amount of drainage. Does that hurt when I touch it like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It does, Doctor. A sharp pain. Not… unbearable, but definitely noticeable. It’s like…a burning feeling too, sometimes. Especially when I try to stand. And it’s been throbbing a little bit. It's worse at the end of the day. Is it…bad? Is it infected? I’ve heard stories… about people losing toes. I don’t want to lose my toes, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano. It's good you’re telling me all of this. The pain, the burning sensation, the throbbing… all of those are signs we need to take seriously. Based on what you're describing, and what I see here, it does appear to be infected. We need to determine the extent of the infection. I'm going to order some tests. We'll need a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, and a blood test to check for signs of infection in your system. We'll also need to check your blood sugar levels, to make sure they're well controlled. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me think. I don’t think so, Doctor. Not that I know of. My wife used to handle all the medicines. She passed away a few years back, you know. I haven’t had much need for them since then. Just some cream for my skin, sometimes. Nothing special. I’m usually a pretty healthy man, for my age. But this foot… this foot is worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It’s alright. We’ll take good care of your foot. And it’s good you’ve been generally healthy. That’s a positive thing. Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’m going to clean and dress the wound. It’s important to keep it covered and protected. We'll also need to offload pressure from your foot as much as possible. Do you have any special shoes you wear, or use any assistive devices like a cane or walker?
PATIENT: Just regular shoes, Doctor. Old, comfortable ones. I used to walk a lot, but… not so much anymore. It's hard on the joints, you know? No cane, no walker. I try to get around on my own as much as possible. My wife… she always said I was a stubborn old man. But this foot… it’s making stubbornness difficult. It hurts too much to walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano. It’s good you’ve been active in the past. We’ll try to keep you mobile as much as possible, but we need to prioritize healing right now. I'm going to gently clean the wound with a saline solution. It might sting a little bit, but I'll be as careful as possible. This will help remove any debris and bacteria. Then, I'll apply a special dressing that will help keep it moist and protected. We'll need to change this dressing daily, or more often if it becomes wet or dirty. I'll have the nurse show you how to do that properly before you leave. Once I’ve dressed it, I'm going to write you a prescription for an oral antibiotic to fight the infection. It’s important to take all of it, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. Do you have anyone who can help you with changing the dressing and making sure you take your medications?
PATIENT: I have my daughter, Leilani. She lives nearby, thankfully. She comes by to visit a few times a week. A good girl, Leilani. She can help with the dressing, I'm sure. And she'll remind me about the pills. I forget things these days, you know? It’s just… hard to keep track of everything. She worries about me. Too much, maybe. But it’s nice to be worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Emiliano. It’s wonderful to have Leilani’s support. Having someone to help you with this will make a big difference. Alright, the dressing is on. I've also written a prescription for Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875mg/125mg twice a day for ten days. The nurse will go over the medication list and aftercare instructions with you before you leave. It’s very important to take all of the medication as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. We also need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely. Are you currently checking your blood sugar at home?
PATIENT: I do, Doctor. I have a little machine. I check it… most mornings. Sometimes I forget, I admit. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But Leilani helps me with that too. She makes sure I write down the numbers. And she tells me what to do if they’re too high or too low. She’s a good girl, really. A very good girl. I try to eat right, too. Not too much sugar. But it's hard, you know? I like my guava cake.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re checking your blood sugar, Emiliano, and that Leilani is helping you with that. And a little guava cake now and then is perfectly alright. It's about balance, right?
PATIENT: Exactly, Doctor. A little balance. Everything in moderation, that’s what my wife always said. So, what do I need to do now? Just take the pills and keep it clean? And let Leilani help?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Emiliano. You’ve got it. Take the Amoxicillin-clavulanate as prescribed, keep the wound clean and dry, and let Leilani help you with everything. The nurse will show you how to properly change the dressing. It’s very important to watch for any signs of worsening infection, like increased redness, swelling, pain, pus, or fever. If you notice any of those, contact us immediately. We’ll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check your progress. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very kind. And you’ve put my mind at ease. I appreciate that. Thank you. Tell the nurse I’m ready when she is.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. And remember, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Take care, and get well soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Emiliano. Have a good day. And again, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
