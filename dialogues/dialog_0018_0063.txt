DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you also. Um... my back. It’s been really bad. A lot of pain. It's been hurting for... well, a while now. And, you know, I have the... the cancer. I thought I should tell you that right away.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. It is important for me to have a complete picture of your health. We will certainly address both your back pain and your cancer history. Let's start with the back pain. When you say “a while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I think, maybe… six months ago? It was just a little ache at first. I thought I just pulled a muscle, you know? From working. But it just kept getting worse. Now it's… sharp sometimes. And it makes it hard to even… sit. Or stand for long.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual onset of pain that has progressively worsened over six months, now interfering with sitting and standing. And you mentioned it's sharp at times—is that a constant sharpness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Most of the time it's just a dull ache, like a heavy weight. But when I move wrong, or try to lift something… oof. Then it’s a real sharp pain. It takes my breath away. And it… it shoots down my leg sometimes, too. Not always, but when it does, it’s bad. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache most of the time, with episodes of sharp pain triggered by movement or lifting, and that sharp pain radiates down your leg. Could you tell me exactly where down your leg the pain goes?
PATIENT: It starts in my lower back, and goes all the way down my right leg. Not my left, just my right. It goes down the back of my leg, all the way to my foot sometimes. And my foot… it feels numb. Not all the time, but when the pain is really bad, my foot goes kind of tingly and numb. Like when it’s asleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Meigs. That's very helpful. So, the pain originates in your lower back, radiates down the entire right leg – to the foot – and is accompanied by numbness or tingling. Now, to get a more complete picture, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm... When I lie down flat, it helps a little. Not a lot, but some. And if I take it really easy, like, don't do anything all day… it’s a little better. But I have to work, you know? I can't just lie in bed. And sometimes… warm baths help for a little while. But it always comes back.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down flat, rest, and warm baths provide temporary relief. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, besides the cancer you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the cancer. And… high blood pressure. The doctor gave me pills for that. I take them every day. And… I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my wrist. But that healed up okay. It doesn't hurt now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous wrist fracture that is fully healed. And you mentioned the cancer – could you tell me a little more about the type of cancer, when you were diagnosed, and what treatment you have received?
PATIENT: It’s in my lung. They found it… about two years ago, I think. It was small then. I had… chemotherapy. Lots of it. And radiation. It shrunk the cancer, the doctor said. But… it didn’t go away completely. I go for check-ups every few months. They take pictures. It hasn’t gotten much bigger, but it’s still there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. That's very important information. And you're currently being monitored with regular check-ups and imaging. Now, let's talk about medications. Besides the high blood pressure medication, are you currently taking any other prescriptions, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. And sometimes, when the pain is really bad, I take… ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, from the store. It doesn’t help much, but it’s something. And… I sometimes take a vitamin. Just a multivitamin, you know? Like, one a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for pain, and a daily multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. Take any medicine. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Meigs, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your back pain, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's going on with my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to start by having you stand and walk a few steps for me. Then, I’ll check your reflexes and muscle strength. And finally, I'll palpate your spine and surrounding muscles to assess for tenderness or abnormalities. Okay, Ms. Meigs, as you bend forward, do you experience any pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It hurts right here, in my lower back. And it… shoots down my leg a little when I do that. Not as bad as when I lift something, but it's there. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some muscle spasm and tenderness in your lower lumbar region, and as you indicated, bending forward exacerbates the pain. There’s also some limited range of motion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please lie flat on your back for me. Alright, Ms. Meigs. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is slightly diminished in your right leg, particularly when extending your toes. This, combined with the pain radiating down your right leg and the numbness you described, leads me to suspect nerve involvement. It is consistent with what is called sciatica. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Sci-a-what? What does that mean? Is that bad? And… could it be the cancer? Is it spreading?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Meigs, and it’s understandable to be concerned about that. Sciatica refers to pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve, which runs from your lower back down the back of your leg. It’s often caused by compression of the nerve, usually from a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. It can be caused by cancer, but in your case, given your history of lung cancer, we need to rule that out definitively. However, based on the initial examination, it appears more likely that your pain is due to a mechanical issue – something pressing on the nerve – rather than the cancer spreading. But we cannot be certain without further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order an MRI of your lower back. This will allow us to visualize the discs, nerves, and surrounding structures and determine the cause of the nerve compression. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An M… R-I? Is that… painful? And does it take a long time? I don't like being in those machines. They make me feel… closed in. But… if it will tell you what's going on, okay. Yes. Let's do it. But… will it show if the cancer has spread?
DOCTOR: An MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, is a painless procedure, Ms. Meigs. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It’s noisy, but we’ll provide you with earplugs. And it usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We will be able to see detailed images of your spinal cord and surrounding structures, which will help us determine if a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or other issue is compressing the nerve. And yes, an MRI can also detect if the cancer has spread to your spine or surrounding tissues. I will write the order for the MRI now, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I am going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain reliever than ibuprofen. And I recommend continuing with the warm baths and trying to avoid activities that aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions about the medications or the MRI?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I hear back about the pictures? And… what happens if it is the cancer? I don’t want to have to go through… more treatment. It was so hard last time. But… I want to know what's going on. I just… I'm scared.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Meigs. It takes courage to face these challenges, and I commend you for coming in to seek answers. The radiology department will typically call us with the results within 24-48 hours. Once I receive the report, I will schedule a follow-up appointment with you as soon as possible to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. If the MRI does show evidence of cancer spread, we will discuss all available treatment options, including radiation, chemotherapy, surgery, and palliative care. We will consider your overall health, your preferences, and the extent of the disease when developing the plan. You will not be alone in this process; we will work with a team of specialists to ensure you receive the best possible care. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting the MRI scheduled and managing your pain. Do you have any questions about the prescriptions I’m writing for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think I’m okay. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And… for not making me feel silly. It hurts so much, and I was worried you wouldn’t believe me. I'll go… and get the pictures taken. And I'll take the pills. I just… I hope it’s not bad.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I am glad I could help. And please, do not hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I will be thinking of you and hoping for the best. My staff will assist you with scheduling the MRI and will provide you with detailed instructions. And remember, we are here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Ms. Meigs.
