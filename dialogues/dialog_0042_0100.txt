DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Vodzak, is it? That’s a pretty name. Um… well, honestly, it’s about a test. A… a drug test, I think? They said I needed one. Something about… work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vodzak. Thank you. It’s perfectly alright if the details are fuzzy, Ms. Hughston. These things can be a bit stressful. So, your employer requested a drug test?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. My employer… oh dear. It’s… paving, I think? Yes, I drive one of those big rollers. A really big one! It's… well, it’s a good job, but it’s hard to keep track of everything these days. I've been… busy. Is that what you need to know? About the job?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Hughston, thank you. Knowing your occupation is important. And don’t worry about keeping track of everything; we can sort through it together. Just tell me what you feel is important. To clarify, are you feeling any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted you to come in today, aside from the required drug test?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh… not really. I mean, I get tired, you know? Being my age and doing that job… it’s tiring. And my back aches sometimes, but that’s just… old age, I reckon. Nothing… nothing wrong, wrong. Just… normal. I don’t feel sick, if that makes sense. I'm just here for the test, like they said. But, honestly, I don't recall why they said I needed it. Was it something I did? Oh dear… now I'm worrying.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be worried, Ms. Hughston. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It sounds like you're generally feeling okay, just experiencing some expected fatigue and back discomfort with your job. And it's perfectly normal to feel anxious about a test when you're unsure of the reason behind it. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. You know, I went to the doctor a lot with my husband, bless his soul. He had… things. But me? I don’t… I think I had high blood pressure, once. A long time ago. They gave me pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like feeling… foggy. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be, of course. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: It's good you've been generally healthy. And no, forgetfulness on its own isn't necessarily a condition, though we can certainly discuss it if it's causing you concern. It's very common as we get older. You mentioned high blood pressure that you stopped taking medication for. Do you know when you were diagnosed, and approximately when you stopped taking the pills?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the dates… that’s the hard part. It must have been… oh, goodness, at least ten years ago, maybe more? Before… before my husband got sick. And I stopped taking them… a couple of years after that, I think? It was a long time ago, and I just don’t remember the specifics. The doctor at the time… he wasn’t very friendly, so I didn't bother asking a lot of questions. I just stopped going to him, and then… well, then things got busy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. We’ll do our best to piece things together. It's good you're sharing this information with me. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out. Years and years ago. Must have been… in the nineties, I think? And I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist. Fell off a ladder while I was picking apples. Silly, really. But that was just an overnight stay. Nothing serious. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I've always been careful, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture. And you said both of those were quite some time ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not really. I tried those vitamin things, you know, the multi-vitamins? But they made my stomach upset, so I stopped taking them. I take a little ibuprofen sometimes for my back, when it's really bothering me, but that’s about it. Just the occasional ibuprofen. And I don’t take it very often, thankfully. I prefer to just rest when my back aches, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ibuprofen for back pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild irritation. Not a proper allergy, I don’t think. And I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I can remember. I’m not really one for taking a lot of pills, you know? Just the ibuprofen when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she lived to be a very old age, but I don’t really remember her having any… ailments. She was just… strong. My father, he… he had a bad heart, I think. He died when I was quite young. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don't really know much about it. We weren’t very close, you see. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s common for family history to be a bit unclear. Knowing that your father had a heart condition and your brother had diabetes is helpful, though. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… oh dear. Well, I work, as you know. Paving. It’s hard work, but I like being outdoors. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. I don’t really have a lot of hobbies, to be honest. I used to like gardening, but my back doesn’t allow for much of that these days. Mostly, I just try to keep busy. And I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re on the road all day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hughston. That gives me a good overview of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, let's talk about why you're here today. You mentioned your employer requested a drug test. Do you have any idea why they requested it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. I just got a notice in the mail. Said it was… a random screening. Something about safety regulations, I think? I don't know. I just show up and do what they tell me. I haven't done anything wrong, I assure you. I don't take anything, except maybe that ibuprofen when my back hurts. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion and your concern, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like this was a routine screening. It’s good that you haven’t taken anything other than the occasional ibuprofen. To proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. A physical exam… alright. Just tell me what to do. I haven't had one in… goodness, I don’t even remember.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Sounds are normal. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. I’m also going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s just take a look at your throat and ears. Throat is clear, and ears appear normal. And finally, let’s just check your back. Do you have any specific areas that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my back. It's been… achy, lately. Especially lower down. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It’s worse after a long day at work, of course. You can press on it, if you need to. Just be gentle, please. It gets… tender.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m feeling some tenderness in the lumbar region, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of injury or inflammation. Muscle tone feels a bit tight, but that’s common with your occupation. Alright, Ms. Hughston, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, aside from the tenderness in your lower back, which is likely related to your work. Based on our conversation and the exam, I don’t have any immediate concerns. The drug test is the priority today. Do you know where you need to go for that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. They gave me a card. It's… somewhere in my purse. Just a moment… Here it is. It’s… LabCorp, I think? On Elm Street. They said to just show up with my ID. I’m a bit worried about it, to be honest. But I guess I have to do it.
DOCTOR: Yes, LabCorp is a reputable lab. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Ms. Hughston. As long as you haven't taken anything other than the ibuprofen, you shouldn't have any issues. I'll document everything we discussed today in your chart. I'm also going to write a note for your employer, just stating that you've had a medical evaluation and are cleared to return to work, pending the results of the drug test. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A note for my employer… that's a relief. Hmm… questions? I don't know… Well… will the test show if I’m just tired? Sometimes I feel so exhausted, like my body is just… worn out. Would that show up on the test?
DOCTOR: That's a good question, Ms. Hughston. No, the drug test won't show if you're simply tired. It specifically looks for the presence of certain substances in your system. Fatigue is a symptom, not a substance. It’s important to address the cause of your fatigue, and we can certainly discuss that further if the drug test comes back negative. It might be related to your work, your age, or something else entirely. We can consider blood work to rule out any deficiencies or underlying conditions. For now, let’s focus on getting the test done. If you have any concerns after the test, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for listening to me. And for writing that note for my employer. I feel a bit better now. I guess I’ll go do the test.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I'm glad I could help. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll be in touch once we receive the results of your test. Have a good day.
