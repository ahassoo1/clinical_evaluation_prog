DOCTOR: Hello Mande, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’m kind of yellow… my skin and eyes, you know? And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s a bit embarrassing, but I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit unusual, but good on you for coming in to get it checked out. Yellowing of the skin and eyes… that’s called jaundice, and the connection to fava beans is interesting. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just regular tired, you know? It’s… like all the energy is just gone. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs, leave me breathless. And I’ve been sleeping a lot more, but it doesn’t really help. It’s been going on for a couple of months now, I think. Maybe three? It’s hard to say exactly, it came on slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath… that’s important information. And you mentioned this happens after eating fava beans – does it happen every time you eat them?
PATIENT: Not every time, no. But most of the time, yes. I eat them maybe once a week, as a treat, with some bread and cheese. But after I eat them, within a day or so, I start feeling really weak, and then the yellowing starts. It doesn’t happen immediately, and sometimes if I just have a small amount, I don’t notice it as much. But a big plate? Definitely. I’m starting to avoid them altogether, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like there’s a definite connection there. This is starting to sound like a possible G6PD deficiency. We'll need to do some tests to confirm, but it's good you're noticing this pattern. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had the usual childhood things, you know, measles, chickenpox. Nothing serious. As an adult, not really. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that's it. No other illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. Oh, and I have some mild high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. Just a small pill every day. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago and controlled hypertension. Yes, that’s good to know, both are relevant. The hypertension medication could have some interaction with certain things, and we’ll want to keep that in mind. What about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… my mother had some heart problems, I think. And my grandfather… he was always a bit sickly, if I remember correctly. But nobody really talked about illnesses much in my family. It was more just… "he wasn't feeling well." Nothing specific. I don’t think anyone ever had anything like what I have now, but I honestly can't say for sure. We weren't very close, and it was a long time ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of heart problems, but nothing specific that sounds like what you’re experiencing. That’s alright, we’ll proceed regardless. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. It wasn’t really agreeing with me. And I’ve never touched any drugs, no. I prefer a good cup of tea, that's all!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. Just tea! Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly go over any allergies you have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I've always been pretty lucky that way. No reactions to any medications I've taken before, and I can eat anything without problems... except maybe the fava beans, apparently! But that's not a typical allergy, is it? It’s more like… they make me sick, but not in an itchy, swollen way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It sounds like the fava beans are causing a specific reaction, and that’s what we’re going to investigate further. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I'll take a closer look at your skin and eyes to assess the jaundice. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead, please. I’m ready when you are. I just hope it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses that I can feel. You’re right, there is definite jaundice. Your skin has a yellowish tinge, and the whites of your eyes are also quite yellow. It’s mild to moderate. I'm also noting some slight paleness. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it is highly suggestive of a hemolytic anemia, potentially triggered by fava beans, as you suspected. We need to confirm this with some blood tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a reticulocyte count, a bilirubin level, and a G6PD enzyme assay. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. All those tests sound fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and what I can do about it. I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking. It can be serious, but it’s also often manageable. The G6PD deficiency itself isn’t usually a problem unless you’re exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. These triggers can cause the red blood cells to break down faster than they should, leading to anemia and jaundice, which is what we suspect is happening here. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of the severity of the anemia and confirm whether or not you have a G6PD deficiency. We'll then discuss a plan. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to avoid fava beans and any medications without my prior approval, just to be safe. Would you be able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. No fava beans, and I’ll check with you before taking anything, even a simple pain reliever. That's no problem at all. So… how long will the tests take? And will I need to come back again? I have a bit of a busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Avoiding those triggers is the most important thing right now. The lab should be able to process the tests relatively quickly. I would estimate results within 24-48 hours. The lab will likely call you with the results and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. This way, we can ensure you fully understand the results and create a comprehensive plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours is good. And a follow-up appointment to talk about everything properly, that's excellent. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be particularly aware of?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It's my pleasure. In the meantime, please watch out for these symptoms and contact me immediately if you experience any of them: fever, shortness of breath, dark urine, or excessive fatigue and weakness. These could indicate a more severe reaction. Also, make sure you stay well-hydrated, as dehydration can sometimes worsen anemia. Otherwise, just try to rest and avoid any unnecessary stress. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Fever, dark urine, excessive fatigue… I’ll keep a close eye out. And I'll avoid the fava beans and check with you before taking anything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal, for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I’ll wait for the lab to call.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. Take care, and I’ll speak to you soon.
