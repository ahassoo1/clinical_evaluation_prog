DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s the cigarettes, really. I’ve been smoking for a very long time, and I think it’s finally time to try and stop. It’s becoming… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Troublesome?
PATIENT: Yes. Troublesome. My breathing isn’t what it used to be, naturally, at my age. And… well, the cost. Everything is so expensive these days, and it feels like a great deal of my money simply vanishes into smoke. It’s foolish, really. I know it’s foolish.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, most people figure that out eventually. Seventy-four years old, and now you decide it's foolish?
PATIENT: It’s not that I haven’t considered it before, Doctor. I’ve… attempted to reduce the amount, a few times. But it never lasted. It's a habit, you see? A long-standing habit. It’s more difficult than one might think. And frankly, I’m hoping you can assist me with making this attempt… successful.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's get some details. How many cigarettes a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Approximately… fifteen, Doctor. Sometimes sixteen, if I'm… agitated. I used to smoke more, perhaps twenty, but I did manage to cut back a little on my own. Fifteen is… the usual amount now. I smoke them throughout the day. After meals, mostly. And with my coffee, naturally. It’s a routine, you see.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been smoking fifteen a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I started smoking properly after the war, so… about sixty years now, I suppose. Fifteen a day… for perhaps the last twenty years. Before that, it was… more sporadic, I’d say. A pack a day sometimes, but not consistently. It’s difficult to recall precisely. A very long time, regardless. A very long time indeed.
DOCTOR: Sixty years. And you’ve never sought help before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. In my day, one didn’t… discuss such things. And frankly, I believed I could manage it myself. Stubbornness, perhaps. A foolish pride. But now… well, now it seems… more urgent. I find myself… short of breath even walking to the shops. And the coughing… it’s not pleasant. I realize now I was wrong to wait so long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had a chest X-ray recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Not recently, no. I had one… perhaps ten years ago, when I had a particularly nasty cold. But nothing since. I haven’t been feeling particularly ill, aside from… the breathing and the coughing, of course. I haven’t thought to request one. Is it… necessary?
DOCTOR: Necessary?
PATIENT: Well, if you're asking my opinion, Doctor? Yes. It would seem… prudent, wouldn’t it? To ascertain the current state of affairs before embarking on any… cessation attempts. I understand you have patients to see, and I don’t wish to impose. But a clear picture of my lungs… it would offer some peace of mind, certainly. And perhaps guide your treatment.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get an order for a chest X-ray. And then we'll discuss options. Don't expect miracles. Sixty years is a long time to undo. But we’ll start with some basic nicotine replacement therapy. Patches, perhaps. And we'll talk about behavioral strategies. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. My blood pressure is… sometimes a little elevated, but nothing that requires medication, the doctor told me so. Otherwise, I’m… reasonably healthy, for my age. A little stiff in the mornings, naturally, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but those are just the effects of growing old. No serious illnesses. And no allergies, thankfully. Patches, you say? I suppose I could try them. I’ve heard… mixed things.
DOCTOR: Mixed things. People always have mixed things to say. They'll complain no matter what you do. Do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I pride myself on not needing medication. A little aspirin for a headache now and then, perhaps, but that’s all. I’ve always believed in letting the body heal itself, if possible. And I've been fortunate enough to avoid needing… stronger remedies. So, the patches… how do they work exactly? And are there any… side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: They deliver nicotine without the harmful chemicals in cigarettes. Side effects?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Side effects. I’ve read that some people experience… skin irritation. And nausea. And dizziness. Are those common? I wouldn't want to replace one unpleasant experience with another, you understand. My stomach isn’t as strong as it used to be. And I’m rather prone to feeling… unsteady on my feet. I would appreciate a thorough explanation, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Skin irritation is possible, yes. Nausea and dizziness are less common, but can happen, especially when you first start. It’s usually mild and temporary. We’ll start with a low dose and increase it gradually. If you have significant side effects, you stop the patches. It’s not rocket science. Now, let’s focus on the X-ray first. I’m ordering it now. It’s down the hall, room 203. They’ll call you when they’re ready. Don’t eat anything for an hour beforehand. Any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I understand. No eating for an hour. Room 203. And start with a low dose of the patches, if we proceed. One question, if you don't mind. Will the patches… affect my appetite? I enjoy my meals, you see. And I wouldn’t want to lose my enjoyment of food, even while attempting to… improve my health.
DOCTOR: Some people experience a slight decrease in appetite. It’s usually not significant. Look, Mr. Knoch, we're dealing with cravings here. Focusing on a slight decrease in appetite is… a luxury. Go get your X-ray. We’ll discuss the patches after we see what your lungs look like. Room 203. Go.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Room 203. Thank you… I suppose. A slight decrease in appetite… indeed.
