DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting, right at the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now, nothin’ terrible, but it just won’t go away completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. A headache at the back of the head… and you say it’s been going on for “a little while.” Could you be a bit more specific about how long, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It started… oh, sometime in June, I reckon. Maybe the second week of June? It comes and goes, you know? Some days it’s barely there, just a dull ache. Other days… well, other days I feel it more. It hasn’t been keepin’ me up at night, thankfully. I just thought I should get it checked out, just in case. Old age creepin’ up on me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting around mid-June, intermittent headache at the back of the head. Not disrupting sleep. Good. And would you describe the pain as sharp, throbbing, pressure-like… or something else?
PATIENT: It's not really sharp, Doctor. Definitely not throbbing. More like… a constant pressure, yeah, that’s it. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head, but not too tight. It’s not the worst pain, but it’s definitely there. And sometimes, it feels like it spreads a little down my neck too, on both sides.
DOCTOR: Pressure-like, radiates to the neck… Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... restin’ does help. Just layin’ down quiet for a bit, that takes the edge off. But nothin’ really makes it completely go away. And I haven’t noticed anything specific makin’ it worse, not that I can think of. I do a fair bit of gardenin’, you see, bendin’ over and whatnot. But I’ve been doin’ that for years, and it never bothered me before. Maybe it is old age!
DOCTOR: Gardenin’… Okay. And have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… no fever, no dizziness. Vision's alright, I think. I still read my newspaper every mornin’. I have been a bit more tired than usual lately, now that I think on it. Just generally feelin’ a little run down, but I put that down to the weather, to be honest. It's been awfully hot these past few weeks. And no nausea or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, no vision changes, some fatigue… Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Aldine?
PATIENT: Well, my wife does most of the cookin’, bless her heart. But I haven’t noticed anythin’ different on my plate, and my trousers still fit alright, so I reckon my weight’s about the same. I maybe haven’t been eatin’ as much when it’s so hot, but that’s just common sense, innit?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I'll have a look in your ears and eyes, just to rule things out. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. No problem at all. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready. I’m a patient man, used to waitin’ for things to grow!
DOCTOR: Alright, Aldine. Blood pressure’s a little elevated, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Lungs and heart sound good. I felt some mild tenderness at the back of your head and neck, which is consistent with what you’ve told me. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion in your neck. Just gently turn your head from side to side, and look up and down. Let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Here goes. Ooh, that’s a little uncomfortable when I look up, yes. Not painful, exactly, but definitely a bit tight there. Like somethin’s pullin’. Just a little bit, mind you. I can still do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age, the intermittent nature of the headache, and the findings on the exam, it’s likely a tension headache, possibly with some mild muscle strain in your neck. The elevated blood pressure is something we'll need to monitor as well. To be on the safe side, though, I'd like to get a basic blood test to rule out any underlying issues. And I’m going to recommend a mild pain reliever – over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen – to see if that helps with the discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood test, pain relievers... yeah, I’m happy with that. I always trust your judgment. I'm not one for takin' a lot of pills, but if it helps, it helps, innit? And keep an eye on my blood pressure, yes. My wife will be pleased to hear that too, she worries somethin’ terrible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood test – just routine blood work, nothing to worry about. And here’s a printout with information on over-the-counter pain relievers and some simple stretches you can do for your neck. If the pain doesn’t improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And definitely follow up with the blood test results as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That’s all very clear, thank you. You’ve put my mind at ease, to be honest. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man ramble on. I’ll get those tests done right away. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aldine. It was my pleasure. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And remember those stretches! .
