DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I’ve noticed some swelling… somewhere. It’s… vague, I’m afraid. I don't quite recall where exactly it began, or when. It just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Vague, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite vague. I apologize for the lack of clarity. It’s… frustrating, even for me. Perhaps it’s on my face? Or my neck? I truly can’t pinpoint it. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit worrying, naturally.
DOCTOR: Naturally. Let's try to be precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Precision is good. Hmm… It doesn’t feel like my neck now, but I could have sworn… Is it alright if I describe how it feels? Perhaps that will be more helpful than trying to recall where it is? It's… soft, but firm. And… a little warm, I think.
DOCTOR: Warm, soft, firm… Yes, well, that narrows it down considerably. Let’s start with a basic examination. Please, lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, Mr. Tomassoni. This will be much faster if you cooperate.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Relaxing is usually quite easy for me. I hope I won't be too much trouble. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Or just… lying here?
DOCTOR: Just lie still. I'll begin with auscultation of your neck, then palpate the area you described. Try not to tense your muscles. It makes my job… difficult. Now, have you experienced any recent trauma to the head or neck?
PATIENT: Trauma? Not that I recall, no. Nothing significant, at least. I… I sometimes forget things. Small bumps, perhaps? I lead a fairly quiet life, mostly indoors. I can’t imagine anything… serious happening. Is that a problem? Should I be recalling something?
DOCTOR: A quiet life is hardly relevant, Mr. Tomassoni. We are attempting to establish a medical history, not a personal one. I am listening for any… unusual sounds. Please breathe normally. Now, let me palpate the area. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. And please, try to focus. This is not a guessing game.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Focusing. I'm trying. You may proceed. I will do my best to report anything I feel. Though, as I mentioned, my recall… … isn't always the most reliable. Please don’t hesitate to guide me if I’m being unclear.
DOCTOR: There is some mild swelling… unilateral, on the left side. Not significant, but present. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Temperature is normal. Hmm. Face appears symmetrical. No obvious lesions. Now, have you noticed any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had to consciously alter my breathing, no. Though… sometimes I feel a little… congested, perhaps? Especially in the mornings. But I assumed that was just… allergies. Or the dry air in my apartment. It’s an old building. It doesn't seem… urgent, if that makes sense. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Congestion and dry air… Mr. Tomassoni, we are dealing with a swelling. I need concrete information, not speculation about your apartment’s heating system. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s a good question. I… believe my mother always said I was sensitive to dust. And perhaps… cats? But it wasn’t severe. Mostly just a little sneezing. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, if that matters. I tend to avoid things that might bother me, rather than seek medical attention. It's usually easier that way. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… and a history of… avoidance. Excellent. And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Medications… I… honestly, I don’t take any regularly. Nothing at all. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take… ibuprofen, perhaps? But that's it. Very rarely. It’s been quite a long time, actually, since I last took anything. I prefer to rest, if possible, rather than rely on medication. Should I be listing anything I took as a child?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tomassoni, we are not compiling a medical history of your childhood. Just current medications. This is… straightforward. Now, let’s move on. Do you have any family history of… unusual swellings?
PATIENT: Unusual swellings… That’s… difficult. My mother passed away quite some time ago, and I didn’t know my father. And I wasn’t particularly close to my extended family. I… don’t recall anyone specifically having… swellings. Though, my aunt… she had some sort of… thyroid problem, I believe? But I’m not sure if that involved swelling. It was a long time ago, and I was quite young. I’m truly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s like trying to recall a dream, really. Faint images, and nothing concrete.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history. We've established you are a 25-year-old male with a vague swelling, no known allergies, no current medications, and a limited medical history. Frankly, Mr. Tomassoni, I suspect this is a minor issue. However, to be thorough… I will order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. Return to the clinic in one week for results. Do not delay.
PATIENT: A complete blood count and a thyroid panel… very well. Thank you, Doctor. I understand. One week, I will be sure to return promptly. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this, despite my… lack of clarity. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Or anything I should be looking out for? .
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tomassoni. Simply observe. And, if the swelling increases dramatically, or you develop any difficulty breathing, go to the emergency room immediately. Do not wait. The lab order is here. That will be all. Next patient. .
