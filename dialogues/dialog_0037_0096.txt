DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Octavis. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this light, you see? It's been bothering me a lot lately. Feels like my eyes are extra sensitive, like I need sunglasses even indoors sometimes. That's why I made the appointment – this photosensitivity.
DOCTOR: Okay, photosensitivity… sensitivity to light. That's a good place to start. And you’ve noticed this happening more recently?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely more recently. I mean, I’ve always been a bit bothered by really bright light, but it's gotten… sharper, I guess? And it’s not just bright sunlight anymore. Even the lights in the grocery store, or my phone screen… sometimes they feel too much. It started maybe a couple of months ago, slowly getting worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months of gradually increasing sensitivity. And it’s affecting more than just sunlight now, impacting things like grocery store lights and your phone screen. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, my eyes sometimes feel a little gritty, like there's something in them, even when I know there isn't. And sometimes, just for a little while, everything looks… washed out? Not blurry, exactly, but not as clear as it usually is. It doesn't happen all the time, though. Mostly when the light is bad, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, gritty sensation and a temporary “washed out” vision, particularly with the light sensitivity. Have you noticed any pain with the light sensitivity, or any redness in your eyes?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. And I don't think they're red. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just try to avoid the light when it bothers me. I’ll check when I get home, but I haven't noticed anything obvious. It's more of a discomfort than pain, you know? Like squinting all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Discomfort is good to note. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was… well, my wife, she always took care of the doctor’s appointments. I’m pretty healthy, I think. I eat okay, try to walk when I can. No diabetes, no high blood pressure that I know of. I have Medicare, so I’ve had check-ups, but nothing major ever came up. It’s just… this light thing is new. I'm a bit worried, honestly. Being widowed… it makes me want to stay on top of things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s good you're being proactive about your health. And I’m sorry to hear about your loss. We’ll do our best to figure this out. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always remembered those things too, but I've never had to tell a doctor "no" when they asked. I just... I don’t react to anything, as far as I know. I eat all sorts of foods, haven't had any trouble with pollen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. I used to take a multivitamin, a long time ago, but I stopped. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just trying to eat healthy, mostly. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or vitamins currently. Okay, let’s move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any eye problems, like glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My wife’s family, yes, her mother had something with her eyes when she got older. I think it was… something with the back of the eye? But my family… my parents are both gone now, and I don't really remember them having any eye trouble. I had a sister, but we haven't spoken in years. I don’t know anything about her health, honestly. I wish I did. It’s been a long time. But I don’t think so, no. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible family history of an eye condition on your wife’s side, but nothing concrete on yours. We can note that. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to a lot of dust or chemicals at work or at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I’m a dental assistant, so I am around some chemicals, but we have all the proper ventilation and protective gear. I wear a mask and glasses all the time at work. At home, it’s pretty quiet. Just me and the TV. No dust, no chemicals, nothing like that. I try to keep things clean. It's just... this light. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal exposure to chemicals, and a clean home environment. That’s good information. Now, I’d like to do a quick eye exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine with me. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m ready whenever you are. Hopefully, we can find out what’s causing this light thing. It's just... unnerving, you know?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Arbin, if you’ll just follow my instructions. I'm going to check your visual acuity first - that’s just reading letters on a chart to see how well you can see at different distances. Then, I’ll check your peripheral vision, and I’ll take a look inside your eyes with an ophthalmoscope to examine your retina and optic nerve. I’ll also check your pupils’ reaction to light. Can you read the largest letter on the chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. That one… that’s definitely an ‘E’. Easy enough. Is that how it works? You just point to the letters as you see them? I haven’t had my eyes checked in… a long time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly how it works. You're doing great. Now, the next line… can you read this one for me?
PATIENT: Okay… let me see… That’s… a ‘D’. And then… a ‘P’. Yes, a ‘D’ and a ‘P’. Is it blurry for you at all? I’m squinting a little, but I think I can see them. I usually don't need glasses, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll keep going. Now, this line... Can you identify these letters for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… this is getting harder. Okay, let me focus… That’s… a ‘C’… and then… oh, I’m not sure about that one. Is that an ‘F’? I can kind of make out a shape, but it’s blurry. I think it's an F, but I’m not confident. This is definitely harder than the last one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Let’s try this next line. It might be even smaller, so take your time. Can you read the letters on this line for me?
PATIENT: Oh… wow. Those are small. Okay, let me really concentrate… I can see… a shape. It looks like an ‘L’… but I'm not sure. Everything is getting really blurry now. I can’t really make out the other letters. I think my eyes are straining. It's okay if we stop, Doctor. I'm just not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We can stop there. That gives me some good information already. Your vision is slightly reduced, particularly with the smaller letters. Now, I'm going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils and examine the back of your eyes with the ophthalmoscope. It won't hurt, but it might be a little bright. Just look straight ahead, and try to relax. Alright, Arbin. I see some mild inflammation in both eyes, and your pupils are reacting normally to light. The retinas appear generally healthy, but there is some mild pallor of the optic disc. This could be indicative of several things.
PATIENT: Inflammation… and something about my optic disc? That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I’m getting a bit worried now. I really don’t want to lose my sight. It’s just… I rely on my eyes for everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that we'll figure this out together. The mild pallor of the optic disc isn’t necessarily serious, but it does warrant further investigation. It could be caused by a number of things, including optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve, or it could be related to a vascular issue. The inflammation in your eyes, combined with the pallor, is why I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying systemic conditions like autoimmune disorders or infections. I also recommend a visual field test, which will assess your peripheral vision more accurately. And finally, an Optical Coherence Tomography, or OCT scan, will give us a detailed look at the layers of your retina and optic nerve. These tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests, a vision test, and a scan… that sounds like a lot, but if it helps figure out what's going on, then yes, absolutely. Anything to get this sorted out. What kind of autoimmune disorders are you thinking about? I haven’t got any… I don’t feel sick, you know? Just this light sensitivity and the blurry vision. Are these tests expensive? I'm on Medicare, so I worry about what it will cover.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Some autoimmune conditions can present with ocular symptoms, even before other systemic signs develop. We’ll be looking for things like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren’s syndrome, amongst others. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions - these tests are simply to rule things out. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, especially given your symptoms. We have a billing department that will verify your coverage and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket expenses before the tests are performed. I will also write detailed notes for them, explaining the medical necessity of each test. I’m going to go ahead and order these tests now. The lab is located just down the hall, and they’ll schedule you for the visual field test and OCT scan as well. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… organized. And reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. Knowing you're on top of things makes me feel a lot better. I’ll go and get these blood tests done, and schedule those other things. Just… is there anything I should be doing now? Like, avoiding bright light completely? Or anything else I can do to help? I don’t want this to get worse before I see you again.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question. While we await the test results, it’s a good idea to minimize your exposure to bright light. Wear sunglasses outdoors, even on cloudy days, and consider using a blue light filter on your phone and computer screens. Avoid prolonged staring at bright screens if possible. Also, if you experience any new symptoms, like double vision, pain in your eyes, or any loss of vision, please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, try to rest and maintain a healthy diet. Don’t worry too much - we'll figure this out together. The lab technician will give you instructions for your blood tests. Do you have any questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Sunglasses, blue light filter, and watch for anything new. Okay, I can do that. Thank you again, Doctor Octavis. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit. I’ll go and get those tests done now. Hopefully, they’ll have the results soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. That’s what I’m here for. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and take care.
