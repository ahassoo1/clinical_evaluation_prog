DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, uh… something about a team? A tryout, I think. My… ex-wife, she signed me up for it. Something with…sports. I don’t really keep track of these things, you know? It’s August already? Time flies.
DOCTOR: A team, you say. And your ex-wife enrolled you…without your full knowledge?
PATIENT: Knowledge is a strong word, Doctor. She mentioned something. Always talking about getting me “out of the house.” Honestly, a waste of time, if you ask me. I used to be…strong. Back in the day. But that was… a long time ago. Not like I need a doctor to tell me that. It's just a formality, right? For the team?
DOCTOR: A formality is one way to put it, Mr. Bartok. However, any physical activity requires a basic health assessment. Even a perceived “waste of time” can reveal underlying issues. Now, let’s start with the basics. What specifically is this tryout for?
PATIENT: Honestly? I haven’t the faintest idea. Something with a ball, I think? And running. She said…softball? Or maybe baseball? They both look the same to me. A bunch of young fellas running around. It’s probably a senior league thing. She likes to embarrass me, that one. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: A ball and running. Very helpful. Alright, Mr. Bartok, regardless of your ex-wife's motivations, we need to determine if you are physically capable of participating in this activity without endangering yourself. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – heart problems, diabetes, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… the usual aches and pains of getting older. Nothing a little liniment can't fix. Heart… well, my father had something with his heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. Diabetes? No, no sugar for me, thank you very much. Arthritis… maybe in my knees, a little. But nothing a doctor needs to worry about. I used to be very active, very strong, like I said. It's just…years. Years take their toll. Is this about my knees? Because if it is, I told you…
DOCTOR: Years do take their toll, yes. However, “a little” arthritis can significantly impact your ability to participate in physical activity. And family history is quite relevant, Mr. Bartok. We need specifics. Were you aware of what your father had?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know he had… some heart trouble. He was a… a heavy man. Always eating rich foods. That’s all I remember. He went to the hospital a lot. They gave him pills. He didn't take care of himself. That’s the whole story. I’m telling you, I feel fine. A little stiff, maybe. But fine. Are we going to get to the part where I actually try out or are we going to sit here all day talking about my father? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration, but a basic assessment is crucial. Knowing your father’s specific condition – was it a heart attack, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Arrhyth-what-now? Doctor, honestly! It was… his heart! He was sick! They poked and prodded him and gave him pills! I was a boy! Do you expect me to remember medical terms? Look, I don’t have time for this. Maybe I should just…forget the whole tryout. It's not worth the aggravation. I'm a busy man. Really, Doctor, it's a waste of both our times. Stop. Just…stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Given your…limited recall of your father’s medical history, and your evident reluctance to provide further details, I’m going to proceed with a basic physical examination. This will include your heart and lungs, blood pressure, and a quick assessment of your knee joints. It’s the minimum I can do to ensure your safety. Do you consent to this examination?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. It’s not like I have a choice, right? Always poking and prodding… Honestly, doctors these days. But yes, alright. Do whatever you have to do. Just don’t expect me to be impressed. And hurry it up, will you? I have…things. Important things. Let’s get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit on the examination table and remove your shirt. I’ll begin with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 78, regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are… somewhat muffled. A slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but breath sounds are diminished basally. Knee joints exhibit crepitus on range of motion. Mild tenderness to palpation medially in both knees. No significant effusion noted. Range of motion is limited, approximately 90 degrees of flexion bilaterally. Peripheral pulses are present, but somewhat weak in the lower extremities. Your examination reveals some concerning findings, Mr. Bartok. Your blood pressure is elevated, and the heart murmur warrants further investigation. The knee limitations will certainly impact your ability to participate in strenuous activity.
