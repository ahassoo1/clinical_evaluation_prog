DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Courtnye is fine. Honestly, it’s kinda worrying me, this bruising. It’s been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so it feels…off. Like, more than usual, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Courtnye, I understand. Bruising, especially with being on blood thinners, certainly warrants investigation. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it started, I'd say, maybe a week ago? Just little ones on my arms, easy to brush off. But now… now there’s a bigger one on my leg, and even a couple showing up on my tummy. I haven’t hit myself or anything, or fallen, or done anything to cause them. That’s what’s got me spooked. And they’re purple, really dark purple.
DOCTOR: I see. A week ago, starting on your arms, and now progressing to a larger bruise on your leg and some appearing on your abdomen, despite no known trauma. Dark purple in color, you said. That is concerning, especially given your medication. To get a more complete picture, could you describe the blood thinner you're taking – the name of the medication, and the dosage, if you know it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s… Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. And I take… 5 milligrams every evening. Doctor gave it to me after… well, after the little heart thing last year. I think that's right, 5 milligrams. I usually just take it with dinner. I don’t really pay super close attention to the number, honestly, just that it’s a little white pill.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Courtnye. Warfarin, 5 milligrams daily, prescribed after a cardiac event last year. I appreciate your honesty regarding the dosage; we can certainly verify that. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I’ve felt a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I work long hours, so that could just be that. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, nothing like that. No weird aches or pains either. Just the bruising and feeling a bit wiped. Oh! And I’ve maybe been a little bit dizzy when I stand up quickly, but that's happened before sometimes. It's hard to say if that's new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no bleeding from gums or nose, no unusual aches or pains. Increased fatigue, and occasional dizziness upon standing, which has occurred previously. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint new symptoms. Courtnye, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me if it’s gonna hurt. I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to needles, just so you know.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Courtnye. We’ll try to make it as comfortable as possible. The exam will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and visually inspecting the bruising. We will also need to draw some blood for testing, including a check of your INR – that's the test that measures how well your Warfarin is working. I will warn you before any discomfort. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Okay. INR… is that the number thing again? I always forget all the names. As long as it tells you if the pills are doing their job, that's good. Hurry up and get it over with, please. This waiting is making me more nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, the INR is the number that tells us how well the Warfarin is working. We’ll get a reading and see if it’s within the therapeutic range. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious during this process, Courtnye. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. My mom always said I took shallow breaths. You can probably hear everything rattling around in there! Is everything okay? Is my heart beating too fast? You’re making me worry now!
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, Courtnye. I’m not hearing anything concerning. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that's understandable given your anxiety and recent increase in bruising. It’s good we are checking these things thoroughly. Now, if you’ll permit me, I'd like to visually inspect the bruising on your arms and legs. Could you please roll up your sleeves and pant legs a bit?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Please be gentle. This is… embarrassing, you know? I’m not usually one to show off my legs. And don't laugh! They're not very pretty. I mostly just wear long pants and sleeves anyway.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Courtnye. There’s no need to be embarrassed; this is all part of the examination process. We're simply gathering information to help determine the cause of the bruising. I see some ecchymoses – that’s the medical term for bruising – on your forearms. They appear to be varying shades of purple and blue. And I see a larger area of bruising on your lower leg, as you mentioned. The bruising appears to be mostly on your extremities, which is a relevant detail. Now, I’ll need to draw some blood for testing. It’s just a small prick, and it will be over quickly. I'll try to be as swift as possible.
PATIENT: Ugh, a needle. Fine. Get it over with. Just don't dig around too much, okay? I faint easily. Seriously. Is it done yet? How much more? This is awful. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Courtnye. Just a few more seconds… and there we are. All finished. You were very brave. I apologize for any discomfort. Now, please keep pressure on this spot for a few minutes to prevent any bruising. While we wait for the lab results, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any recent falls or injuries, even minor ones, that you might not have initially noticed?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I haven’t fallen or bumped into anything. I’m really careful, actually. I work in IT, so I spend most of my day sitting at a desk. Maybe I’ve walked into a doorframe once or twice, but that's it! And it definitely didn’t leave bruises like this. I'm telling you, something is wrong. And it’s scaring me. It’s…it’s just not normal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Courtnye. Your apprehension is perfectly valid, especially given the lack of a clear cause for the bruising. To help narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me about any other medications or supplements you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take… a multivitamin, just the basic one from the grocery store. And sometimes, when my back acts up – which is pretty often, thanks to sitting at a computer all day – I take ibuprofen. Just 200 milligrams, when I need it. And… oh! And I drink a lot of green tea. Like, several cups a day. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I try to stay pretty healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Courtnye. Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and significant green tea consumption. That's helpful information. Now, regarding your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any bleeding disorders, or have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No bleeding disorders. And… no surgeries, actually. Never had anything removed or anything. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, until… well, until this heart thing last year. It was just a little flutter, the doctor said. They did a little procedure to fix it, but it wasn't surgery. Just… poking around with a wire, I think. They put a little… something in there. I don't remember all the details. It was stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. A cardiac procedure last year involving a wire and the placement of a device – likely a pacemaker or defibrillator, although we can confirm that in your records. No prior surgeries. Finally, could you briefly describe your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, my mom… she had high blood pressure, like a lot of Tongans do. And my dad… he passed away when I was young, from a heart attack. I think he smoked a lot. And my brother… he's perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives on the other side of the island, so we don't talk much. As for anyone else… I don’t really know much about their medical history. My family doesn’t really talk about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Courtnye. History of high blood pressure in your mother and a cardiac event in your father. I appreciate you sharing this information. Alright, let me review your chart… Ah, yes. You underwent a successful transcatheter ablation last year for supraventricular tachycardia. And your records confirm the medication list you provided. The INR from your last blood draw, taken a week ago, was 2.1. That’s within the therapeutic range, but slightly on the lower end, meaning your Warfarin dose may need adjustment. However, that doesn't fully explain the recent increase in bruising. Given your history and the absence of any clear explanation, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your overall blood health and clotting factors. We will also need to rule out any underlying causes of easy bruising.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. But I’m really worried, Doctor. What if it’s something serious? My dad… I just want to know what’s going on and get this fixed. Can you at least tell me what could be causing it? Even if it’s just a possibility? Just…something.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Courtnye, and I assure you we’re taking this seriously. It's natural to be concerned, especially given your father’s history. While we wait for the lab results, let’s discuss some possibilities. Given your Warfarin use, we need to ensure the dosage is correct. Although your previous INR was within range, it can fluctuate. Rarely, certain medications can interact with Warfarin and cause bruising. Vitamin K deficiency can also contribute, but that's less likely with a normal diet. Less common, but possible, causes include underlying blood disorders, such as thrombocytopenia , or a problem with your blood vessels. In extremely rare cases, it could indicate a more serious underlying condition, but we will rule those out with the necessary testing. It’s important not to jump to conclusions before we have the lab results. However, I want to reassure you that we’re being thorough and will investigate every possible cause. For now, please avoid any strenuous activity that could lead to injury and continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed. We will contact you as soon as the lab results are available, typically within 24-48 hours. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that’s… a lot. So it could be a bunch of different things. I guess I just have to wait. 24-48 hours… that feels like forever. And what if I can’t get ahold of you? What if something bad happens? And… what do I do if I start bruising more? Do I go to the emergency room? I don’t want to bother anyone if it’s just… normal. But I’m really scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Courtnye. Waiting can be difficult, especially when you’re feeling anxious. Let me address your concerns. First, regarding contacting me, my office will call you directly with the lab results. If you don’t hear from us within 48 hours, please call the office directly, and the on-call physician will be available to assist you. Now, regarding increasing bruising, that’s an important question. If you notice any significant increase in bruising – meaning a sudden appearance of large bruises, bruising that occurs without any known trauma, or bleeding that is difficult to stop – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It’s always better to err on the side of caution. If it’s just a slight increase in existing bruising, you can call the office during regular business hours, and we’ll advise you further. We are here to support you, Courtnye. We’ll investigate this thoroughly and determine the cause of the bruising. Please try to remain calm and avoid any activities that could lead to injury. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And for not making me feel like I’m overreacting. I just… want to feel normal again. And hopefully, it’s nothing serious. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, we're here to support you, and we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
