DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Hilber. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It's… it's my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It's been happening for a little while now. Not real bad at first, but it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: “Trouble emptying your bladder, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That's right. It feels… full, even after I think I've gone. And sometimes… it's hard to start going, if you understand. It's not painful, just… frustrating. And a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Okay. So, not painful, but a sense of incomplete emptying and difficulty initiating the stream. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It started… maybe three months ago? It wasn't too bad then, just a little slow. But the last month or so it's been more noticeable. Like I said, it's getting worse, not better. I don’t keep real good track of dates, if you understand. It’s been a long winter and spring, and then summer just came. Time gets away from you.
DOCTOR: “Right. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – any urgency, frequency, straining, a weak stream, or any pain during urination, even if it's mild?
PATIENT: Urgency… not really. I don't feel like I have to go all the time. And no, not straining exactly. It just… takes a little effort, you know? And like I said, no pain. The stream… it's not real strong, maybe. Not like when I was younger, of course. But I’m an older man, Doctor. Things slow down. I just noticed it’s… weaker than it used to be, but I don’t know if that's new. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: “Alright. Your chart indicates you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and hyperlipidemia. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, well… my wife, she passed away last year. It was a long illness. I haven’t been feeling quite myself since then, but I don’t know if that has anything to do with my water problems. Aside from that… no, not really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I've seen Dr. Olsen for years and he keeps an eye on things. He's retired now, though. That's why I'm here with you.
DOCTOR: “Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm a few years back, but that wasn't a surgery. Aside from that… no, not really. Nothing major, to my recollection. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: “Any family history of prostate problems, bladder issues, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My father… he didn’t talk much about his health. My mother, she passed when I was young. I don’t really know. I don’t think so. We weren't a family that talked about those kinds of things, if you understand. My brother, he’s still alive, but we don’t see each other much. I haven’t asked him about his health, to be honest. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: “Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me see… just the lisinopril, Doctor. That’s what Dr. Olsen put me on for my pressure. Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, but that's just over the counter. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. But not every day. Only when it's really bad. I try to get by without it if I can.
DOCTOR: “Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat most everything. I try to eat healthy, but I like my fish and berries, you know? Alaska has good fish and berries. I've been pretty lucky with allergies. Never had any trouble.
DOCTOR: “Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, then we'll discuss next steps. Please lie down on the examination table.”
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: “I'm just going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not really. Just feels… normal, I guess. A little sensitive, maybe, but I don't think that's pain. It's just… my belly. It's seen a few things over the years.
DOCTOR: “Now I'm going to do a quick rectal exam to check your prostate. This will help me assess its size and texture. Please bear with me.”
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I understand. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: “Okay. Your prostate feels… enlarged. Not dramatically, but larger than ideal. It’s also somewhat firm. I don’t feel any acutely suspicious nodules, but it warrants further investigation. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test. The PSA will give us a better idea of your prostate’s health.”
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? That doesn't sound too good. What does that mean, Doctor? And what is this… PSA test? Will it be painful? I just want to understand what’s going on, if you don’t mind explaining. I appreciate you taking the time with me.
DOCTOR: “An enlarged prostate is common as men age. It’s often benign – meaning not cancerous – but it can be a sign of prostate cancer or other issues. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can indicate prostate cancer, inflammation, or infection. It's not painful, just a standard blood draw. We need to rule things out. I'm also going to order a flow rate test to measure how quickly your bladder empties.”
PATIENT: So… a blood test and a test of how fast my water goes? Cancer… that’s what I’m worried about. My brother, he… he had something a few years back. Not prostate, but still. It scared us all. Is this something I should be really worried about, Doctor? I just want to know what I’m up against. And how long will it take to get these tests back?
DOCTOR: “It’s too early to worry about cancer. Most men with enlarged prostates do not have cancer. But it’s important to be thorough. These tests will give us more information. The lab results usually take about three to five business days. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and decide on the next steps. It may involve further testing or a referral to a urologist if necessary. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I guess. Just… how do I get these tests done? Do I come back here? And will my insurance cover them? I have Medicare, if that makes a difference. I just want to make sure everything is taken care of properly. I don't want any surprises. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things to me. It helps to know what’s going on, even if it’s scary.
DOCTOR: “The lab is just down the hall. Take this order with you, and they’ll draw the blood. Medicare should cover it, but it’s best to confirm with them directly. The referral slip is for a urologist, Dr. Ramirez. We’ll schedule that appointment if the results warrant it. We’ll call you with the results in five business days. If you haven’t heard from us by then, please call the office. Any further questions, you can call the front desk. Next patient.”
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your help.
