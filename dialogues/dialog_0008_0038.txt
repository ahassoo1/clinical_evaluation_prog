DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I need to… arrange some things. Concerning what happens if… well, if I become unable to make decisions for myself. I was advised to come speak with a doctor about it, and I understood something called an Advance Directive or a POLST form might be what I require. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Buoniconi. That’s perfectly alright. It's very responsible of you to think about this now. An Advance Directive and POLST form are both good options, and we can definitely discuss which one might be best for you. Essentially, they're legal documents that help ensure your wishes are known if you’re unable to speak for yourself. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're thinking about this now?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. There haven’t been any specific incidents, not recently. It's more a… growing awareness, I suppose. A feeling that… things could change. I live alone, you see. And while I have… acquaintances, I wouldn’t want to burden anyone with difficult choices they aren’t prepared to make. It feels… prudent to be prepared, for my own peace of mind, and theirs. Though, as I said, my recollection of why I specifically decided to address this now… is quite fragmented. I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s very proactive of you to think about this, and it doesn’t require a specific incident to be important. It sounds like you're thinking about future planning, which is excellent. Okay. So, we'll talk through what these documents cover, and you can decide what feels right for you. First, let's briefly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: That… is a good question. I’ve always been relatively healthy, I believe. I see a dentist regularly, of course. And I had… a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that was easily treated. Beyond that… I had my gallbladder removed some years ago. Perhaps fifteen years? It was a routine procedure, and I recovered well. I’m… not certain if that would be considered a chronic condition. I’ve not been regularly monitored for anything, if that answers your question. I apologize again for my… vagueness. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Buoniconi. It's more important to get things right, and we have time. Fifteen years ago is quite a while back, and gallbladder removal typically doesn’t require ongoing management. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: I… do not believe so. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. No known drug allergies, thankfully. I enjoy a fairly varied diet, and have never experienced a reaction to anything I’ve consumed. Though, I recall a slight… discomfort once after eating mango. It wasn’t severe, merely a mild itching, and I dismissed it as perhaps a seasonal sensitivity. It hasn’t recurred. I realize I’m being rather… imprecise. I truly wish I could offer more concrete information.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Buoniconi. We're just gathering information. Mild itching after eating mango could be a minor allergy or something else entirely, so it's good you mentioned it. No need to worry about it for now. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a daily multivitamin. A rather basic one, purchased from the pharmacy. And occasionally, when my joints feel stiff – particularly in the colder months – I use a topical cream containing menthol. I believe it’s for muscle aches. That is… all. No regular prescriptions, thankfully. I hope I am not being… overly tedious with these details. It feels rather… fragmented, piecing things together.
DOCTOR: You're not being tedious at all, Ms. Buoniconi. This is standard practice, and it’s helpful to have a clear picture. The multivitamin and menthol cream are good to know. Now, just a quick question about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of early-onset dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question. My family is… rather dispersed. I haven’t maintained close contact with many of them over the years. My mother… she suffered from periods of… confusion, in her later years. It was attributed to age, primarily. But it wasn’t… formally diagnosed, if that makes sense. And I… don’t recall any other instances of similar conditions within the family. My paternal grandfather… he was known to be… eccentric. But whether that was merely his personality, or something more… I couldn’t say. It's… a hazy recollection, I'm afraid. I apologize for my lack of precision. It feels… delicate, discussing these matters.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It’s perfectly understandable. Vague recollections are common, and it’s good to know what you do remember. Periods of confusion in your mother and your grandfather’s eccentricity are worth noting. Alright. And finally, a quick question about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I… occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. But I don’t consider myself a drinker, certainly not habitually. And I have never used… recreational drugs. Never any inclination towards them, thankfully. I believe that… covers most of the pertinent details. Though, I apologize again for the… fragmented nature of my responses. It feels as though I am searching through fog, at times.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Buoniconi. You’ve given me a very good overview. Occasional wine is fine. Okay, so based on what you've told me, it sounds like you’re in good overall health. Given your concerns about potential future inability to make decisions, and your desire to document your wishes, we can discuss an Advance Directive and a POLST form. Would you like me to explain the difference between the two?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be most helpful. I recall something about POLST being more… immediate, perhaps? But my recollection is… unreliable. An explanation of both, and which might be more appropriate for my situation, would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let’s start with Advance Directives. An Advance Directive is a legal document that allows you to state your wishes for medical care should you become unable to speak for yourself. It typically includes two parts: a Living Will, which outlines your preferences for end-of-life care – things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, which names someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you can’t. It’s a broader, more comprehensive document. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is different. It’s a medical order, essentially a set of instructions for your healthcare team about what treatments you want or don't want. It’s more focused on immediate, life-sustaining interventions – things like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It’s usually completed in consultation with your doctor, and is typically used for people with serious illnesses or frailty. Given your concerns about future inability to make decisions, and the fact that you don’t have a serious illness currently, an Advance Directive, including both a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, would likely be the most appropriate starting point. We can complete that today, and you can always revisit it later if your situation changes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… remarkably clear, Doctor. Thank you. So, the Advance Directive is more… proactive, outlining my general wishes. While the POLST is a more immediate set of instructions for a specific scenario. That distinction is… helpful. Given my current state of health, and my desire to simply… prepare for the future, the Advance Directive does indeed seem the more appropriate option. I believe I would like to proceed with that, if you are agreeable. Perhaps we could discuss naming someone as my Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare? I have a… few acquaintances I could consider. Though, I am uncertain who would be best suited for such a responsibility.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That sounds like a good plan. We can definitely proceed with the Advance Directive. Naming a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare is a very important step. It should be someone you trust implicitly to make medical decisions on your behalf, someone who understands your values and wishes, even when you can't express them yourself. It doesn’t have to be a family member; it can be a close friend, a lawyer, or anyone you feel comfortable with. Do you have anyone in mind already?
PATIENT: There’s… Anya Petrova. She’s a… colleague, of sorts. We both work with etching and engraving. We’ve known each other for many years, and I trust her judgment implicitly. She is… pragmatic, and remarkably level-headed. Though, she is… not particularly familiar with medical terminology. Would that be a significant issue? Perhaps I should consider someone else? It’s… a difficult decision. I don’t want to burden anyone with a responsibility they are not prepared to handle.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Ms. Buoniconi. Anya sounds like a sensible person, which is very important. It’s not essential for her to be familiar with medical terminology. Her primary role would be to understand your wishes and advocate for them. We can certainly discuss your preferences in detail with her present, and I can answer any questions she might have. We can also include specific instructions in the Advance Directive, outlining your wishes regarding certain treatments, which would guide her decision-making process. It's more important that she is someone you trust completely and is willing to carry out your wishes, even if they differ from her own. Do you think she would be willing to take on this responsibility?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe she would. Anya is… conscientious, and deeply empathetic. She is not one to shy away from responsibility, and she values our friendship greatly. I will, of course, discuss it with her thoroughly before making any final decisions. I wouldn't want to impose such a burden without her full understanding and consent. If she is willing, would it be… advisable to have her present during the completion of the Advance Directive? So she can ask any questions directly, and we can ensure she fully understands my wishes? Perhaps that would alleviate any concerns.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Ms. Buoniconi. That’s an excellent idea. Having her present during the completion of the Advance Directive would be very beneficial. It would allow her to ask questions directly and ensure she fully understands your wishes. We can go through each section together, and I can explain the implications of each choice. Would tomorrow afternoon work for both of you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon would be… ideal, Doctor. Anya has a relatively flexible schedule, thankfully. I will confirm with her immediately after our conversation. Thank you for your patience, and your guidance. This… feels significantly less daunting with your assistance. I truly appreciate your willingness to explain everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I’m glad I could help. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit overwhelmed by these things, and I’m happy to take the time to ensure you feel comfortable and informed. So, we’ll schedule an appointment for tomorrow afternoon, and Anya can join us. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. I will contact Anya immediately and confirm our appointment for tomorrow. Thank you again for your time, and your assistance. I… feel considerably more at ease now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I look forward to seeing you and Anya tomorrow. Have a good day.
