DOCTOR: Hi Nathaiel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Maskal, it’s good to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think? It’s about getting my shots up to date. I got a notice in the mail, and honestly, I sometimes forget which ones I’ve had, so I figured it was best to come in and get it sorted out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a very sensible thing to do! It’s easy to lose track. Let me pull up your record here… Alright, Nathaiel PaguiO, age 47. And you received a notice about vaccinations, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nathaiel PaguiO, 47 years old. And yes, the notice… it mentioned something about a booster, I believe? Or maybe it was just a general check-up on what I need. I really don’t recall the specifics, sorry. It’s just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, that's what I'm here for! Okay, I see here you're up-to-date on your tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – Tdap – as of 2020. Your influenza vaccine is current through last season. It looks like you're due for a shingles vaccine booster, and potentially a pneumococcal vaccine, depending on when you had your last one. Do you recall ever having had a shingles vaccine before?
PATIENT: Hmm… shingles vaccine. That rings a very faint bell. I think… maybe ten years ago? Possibly more. It was at a pharmacy, I seem to remember. It wasn’t here, that’s for sure. I really can’t be certain though, to be honest. It was a while back. Would that be in your records, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Let me check… Okay, it appears you received the Shingrix vaccine – two doses – in February and March of 2015. So, it has been over ten years. That means you are eligible for a booster. As for the pneumococcal vaccine, your last dose was in 2018. Given your age and health history, we should go ahead and get you updated on that one as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, alright. If it’s been that long, then updating them both makes sense. Two shots, then? Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Or anything I should be aware of afterward, like side effects? I get a little anxious about these things, so knowing what to expect helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Two injections today. We'll do them in your upper arm. As for preparation, nothing special. Just come hydrated and be prepared to stay for about 15-20 minutes afterward for observation. Common side effects are soreness at the injection site, maybe a little redness or swelling. Some people experience mild fatigue, headache, or muscle aches, but those usually resolve within a day or two. We have pain relievers available if needed. It’s very rare to have a serious reaction, but we'll monitor you just in case. Do you have any allergies to vaccines or any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. No allergies to vaccines, and no medication allergies either. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. And okay, hydrated and stay for 15-20 minutes. Soreness is… expected, I suppose. Better safe than sorry, right? Is there anything I should tell you, anything about my health that might be relevant? I try to stay healthy, but… well, I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the allergies. And you're right, better safe than sorry is always a good approach. And absolutely, anything at all is helpful. Do you have any chronic medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, lung problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No diabetes, no heart disease, and my lungs are fine as far as I know. I did have a kidney stone a few years back, but it passed on its own and the doctor said everything looked good after that. Nothing ongoing there. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Just a small dose, once a day. And… that’s about it, I think. I try to eat healthy and get a little exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a history of a kidney stone that resolved. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the blood pressure medication, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever, Ibuprofen, for headaches. But that's very infrequent, maybe once or twice a month if I have a bad one. That's it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily for blood pressure, and occasional Ibuprofen for headaches. That’s helpful. Alright, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs just to be sure everything sounds good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds very sensible. Checking everything beforehand is a good idea. Please do. I trust your judgment, Dr. Maskal. I’ll just… roll up my sleeve, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths… This is fine. Everything’s fine. I just don't like needles, that's all. But… better to be protected, right? Just let me know when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds good. Alright, Nathaiel, we’re all set. I’ll get the vaccinations prepared. Just a pinch, and then we'll have you sit for 15-20 minutes afterwards to monitor for any reaction. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. “A pinch,” you say? Alright. I’ll try not to flinch too much. Thank you, Dr. Maskal. I appreciate your patience. Let’s get it over with, then. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nathaiel. And you're doing great. It really will be quick. Just a small pinch, and then it’s done. I’ll warn you before I inject. There you go. Just a little pressure. Now, the second one…
PATIENT: Ouch! Okay… yes, a little pinch is putting it mildly. But… it’s done, right? Let’s get the other one over with quickly, please. The faster, the better. I don’t want to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: There we go. All done. You were very brave, Nathaiel. Now, let’s have you sit here for 15-20 minutes, and I’ll come back to check on you. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual, like dizziness, shortness of breath, or a rash. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Okay… sitting. 15-20 minutes. Just sitting. It's done, it's done, it's done… Just need to wait now. I hope I don’t feel too awful afterward. A little ache is okay, I suppose. But no dizziness, please. No dizziness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nathaiel, how are you feeling?
PATIENT: A little achy, but okay, I think. No dizziness or anything scary. Just… a dull ache in my arm. It's not terrible. Honestly, I was expecting worse. I think I’m good. It’s a little stiff, but manageable. Is there anything I should be doing? Or avoiding?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent news. A little soreness is perfectly normal and expected. You can use the arm normally, but try to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the rest of the day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the discomfort if needed. And just keep an eye on the injection sites for any signs of infection, like redness, swelling, or pus. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. No questions. Just… thank you, Dr. Maskal. You were very patient with me, and I appreciate that. I feel much better knowing I’m up to date on my vaccinations. I think I’m all set, then. I’ll just go home and rest my arm. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nathaiel. I’m glad I could help. And you were a very good patient! If you do experience any unusual symptoms in the next few days, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here's a discharge instruction sheet with more detailed information. Have a good day, and get some rest! .
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Maskal. I will. You too. Goodbye! .
