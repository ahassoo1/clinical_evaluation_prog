DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain’t one for small talk. It’s… blood. Coming from where it shouldn’t. Been happenin’ a few days now. Not a pretty sight, I’ll tell ya. And frankly, I’m tired of messin’ with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, I understand. It sounds concerning, and you're right to get it checked out. When you say “where it shouldn’t,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, it ain't comin' outta my ears, Doc. It’s… lower end. When I, uh, you know… go to the bathroom. And it's not just a little. It’s… substantial. Look, I don’t wanna get graphic with you, but it’s enough to worry a man. And it smells… different. Not right. I've never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Gentz. It’s good you’re being specific. So, blood in your stool – and you’ve noticed it for a few days now, is that correct?
PATIENT: A few days, yeah. Maybe four, five? Hard to keep track when you're constantly… lookin' at it. It started small, kinda thought it was somethin' I ate. But it’s gotten worse. And like I said, the smell. It’s… rotten. I don’t know how else to put it. And I’m feelin’ a bit weak, now that I think about it. Not much energy, kinda tired all the time. Though, to be honest, I’ve always been a bit tired. But this is… different tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so four or five days of noticing blood in your stool, increasing in amount, a change in the smell, and you've also noticed some weakness and fatigue. Has there been any pain associated with this – abdominal pain, cramping, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More like… discomfort. A dull ache, low down. Comes and goes. It doesn’t stop me from doin’ things, but I’m aware of it. And, honestly, I’ve had a lot of things wrong with me over the years. I’m not one to complain about a little ache. But this whole situation… the blood, the smell, the feelin’ weak… it’s a bad combination. It just ain’t right. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Gentz. It sounds like a concerning combination of symptoms, and you're right to be worried. A dull ache in the lower abdomen along with the other symptoms is something we need to investigate. Now, I'm going to ask a few more questions to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – like diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing of your stool?
PATIENT: Changes? Yeah, a bit. It's… looser than usual. Not full-blown diarrhea, mind you, but not… solid. And, yeah, I think it's narrower. Now that you mention it. I hadn't really paid much attention, to be honest. I'm a simple man, Doc. I don't spend a lot of time lookin' at… that stuff. But now that you ask, yeah, it seems thinner. And I'm goin' more often than I used to. Used to be regular as clockwork. Now it's… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools, narrowing of the stool, and more frequent bowel movements. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Gentz. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I get a bit queasy sometimes, yeah. Especially after… well, you know. After seein' what I've been seein'. But it ain’t vomitin’ queasy. Just a bit… unsettled. And I haven’t been eatin’ much lately, to be honest. Don’t have much of an appetite. Everything just seems… tasteless. I used to love a good kebab, but even that doesn’t appeal to me now. It’s like my stomach is… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, some nausea, decreased appetite, and food tasting tasteless. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history? Lord, where do I start? I'm an old man, Doc. I've had things wrong with me my whole life. Back problems, mostly. Spent years workin' hard labor. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back. Nearly died, actually. But other than that… nothin’ major. The doctor always said my heart was strong, even with all the other things. And I never had any of them fancy diseases like diabetes or nothin'. Just… aches and pains. Regular man stuff. My wife… she always took care of me. She knew all the details. She's gone now, though. Passed away last year. So, I’m not sure what all they told her. I try not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gentz. That must be very difficult. Okay, so past medical history of back problems and pneumonia. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Just the one. Appendicitis when I was a young man. Back in Yemen, it wasn't like it is here. They just cut it out, quick and dirty. Didn’t have all these fancy machines and tests. It healed fine, though. Been nothin’ wrong with it since. That was… a long time ago. Before I even came to this country. Everything was simpler back then, you know? Less to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in Yemen as your only surgery. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nah. I don't believe in 'em. Never have. A little painkiller now and then, maybe. But that's about it. I try to avoid all that stuff. Makes you feel worse in the long run, I reckon. I prefer to tough it out, you know? My wife used to try and get me to take somethin' for my back, but I always refused. And I don't take any of those fancy vitamins or supplements either. Waste of money, if you ask me. Just good, honest food is what a man needs. Though, like I said, even that doesn't taste right these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had any medical conditions, particularly any digestive problems, like colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That's a tough one. My family back in Yemen… I haven't seen 'em in years. We don't keep in touch much. Too far away, too expensive. And my wife… her family was… private. Didn't talk much about medical things. I know her mother had… somethin' with her stomach, years ago. But I don't know what. She passed away when I was still relatively new to this country. I don’t recall any of them havin' any of that… colon cancer, you said? No, not that I know of. Honestly, Doc, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. They weren't ones for sharing. It's just… not somethin' we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited knowledge of family history. Finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a foolish habit. And drink… I used to, back in my younger days. A little wine with dinner, maybe. But I gave it up years ago. Didn't agree with me. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a simple man, Doc. I don't need any of that nonsense. Always been straight and narrow, as they say. Just hard work and honest livin'. That's all I've ever known. Though I admit, these days I wish I had somethin' to take the edge off. But not drugs, mind you. Just... somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Gentz. Now, I'm going to need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and I'll also need to do a rectal exam. This is important to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Look, Doc, I ain’t thrilled about that, but if it’s gonna help, I suppose. I ain’t exactly comfortable with it, but I’m here to get this sorted, right? Just… try to be quick about it, if you could. And… well, you know. Be gentle. I've had a rough life, as you can tell. Just… don’t poke around too much. Just get it done, and let’s see what you find. I'm a patient man, but I’m not one for unnecessary fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. Okay, I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in your lower left quadrant. No masses are palpable at this time. Now, I’ll need you to lie on your left side, with your knees bent. I'll use lubrication and a gloved, finger to gently examine the lower part of your colon and rectum. This will allow me to check for any abnormalities. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, Mr. Gentz. I did find some stool present, and there was some evidence of blood on the glove. I also felt a small, firm mass in the lower part of your rectum. It's difficult to say what it is without further investigation, but it's concerning. It wasn’t particularly painful to palpate. Your prostate feels normal in size and consistency.
PATIENT: A mass? Now you're tellin' me somethin' I don't want to hear. A mass... Is that… bad? What kinda mass? Cancer? My wife… she had a friend… same thing. It didn’t end well. Look, Doc, don’t sugarcoat it. What are we dealin’ with here? And what do we do next? I need to know. This is… this is not good, is it? I knew it wasn’t just a little blood. I knew it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concern, and it's perfectly natural to be worried. Finding a mass is definitely something that needs to be investigated further. However, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. A mass doesn’t automatically mean cancer. It could be a number of things – a polyp, a hemorrhoid, or even an inflammation. To determine exactly what it is, we’ll need to do some additional testing. I recommend a colonoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon and take a biopsy of the mass. I’m also going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia or infection. We should also consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to see if the mass has spread to any other areas. I know this is a lot to take in, and I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together, step by step. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? More pokin’ around? Look, Doc, I ain’t lookin’ forward to any more of that. But if it's gotta be done… it's gotta be done. What's involved? Will it be painful? And how long will I be… out of commission? I got things to do, you know? I can’t just disappear for weeks. And… how much is all this gonna cost? I’m on a fixed income. I don’t have a lot of money to throw around. And what if it is cancer? What then? What are my options? I need straight answers, Doc. No sugarcoat. I’ve had enough of that already.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz, let's address your concerns one by one. A colonoscopy does involve inserting a scope into your rectum, but it’s generally not painful. You’ll be given sedation to help you relax and minimize any discomfort. Most patients sleep through the entire procedure. The biggest discomfort comes from the bowel preparation – you’ll need to drink a special liquid to clear your colon, which can cause some cramping and diarrhea. The procedure itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. You’ll need someone to drive you home afterward, as you won’t be able to drive yourself due to the sedation. You may feel some mild cramping and bloating for a day or two afterward, but you should be able to return to your normal activities relatively quickly. Regarding cost, it varies depending on the facility and the insurance coverage. Since you mentioned being uninsured, we can discuss financial assistance options and payment plans with the hospital billing department. I can also connect you with resources that may help cover the cost of the procedure. We will do everything we can to make it affordable. If the colonoscopy reveals cancer, the treatment options depend on the stage and location of the cancer. These may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of these. We’ll discuss all of the options in detail and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. It’s important to remember that cancer treatment has advanced significantly in recent years, and there are many effective options available. I want to schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, contact you to schedule an appointment and provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the procedure. She will also answer any questions you may have. Do you have any other concerns at this point?
PATIENT: Maria, huh? Alright. That sounds… manageable. I guess. Look, Doc, I appreciate you explainin’ everything. It still ain’t good news, but at least I know what we’re dealin’ with. And I appreciate you bein’ straight with me. I’ve met doctors who wouldn’t tell you the truth. Just… make sure Maria explains the prep real clear. I ain't a young man anymore. And, uh, tell her to be gentle when she calls. I'm already stressed enough. And… one last thing. If it is bad… who do I talk to? Who helps me… deal with all that? I don't have my wife anymore. She always knew what to do. I'm on my own with this, ain't I?
DOCTOR: You're not on your own with this, Mr. Gentz. Absolutely not. Maria is very good at explaining the prep instructions, and she’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. We'll make sure you're as comfortable as possible throughout the entire process. And yes, if the colonoscopy reveals cancer, we have resources available to help you cope with the emotional and practical challenges. We have social workers and counselors who specialize in supporting patients and their families. They can provide you with emotional support, connect you with support groups, and help you navigate the treatment process. I can also refer you to a local cancer support organization that offers a variety of programs and services. I'll also make a note in your chart to ensure that you receive comprehensive support throughout your journey. It’s important to remember that you don't have to go through this alone. We’re here to help you every step of the way. I'll have Maria contact you tomorrow to schedule the colonoscopy. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. We'll do everything we can to support you, Mr. Gentz.
