DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it's rather simple, Doctor. My skin. It’s darkened. And I tire easily, you see. Simply exhausting, this whole business. I haven’t the time for such ailments, frankly. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: “Darkened skin” and fatigue… Alright. When you say darkened, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Really, Doctor. It's… darker than it used to be. It’s not… luminous, if that’s what you’re implying. Just… less pale. Honestly, I don’t recall precisely when it started. Old age, probably. It’s a natural process, isn’t it? I'd hoped you'd know these things.
DOCTOR: It can be a natural process, yes. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Has this change in skin color been all over, or in certain areas?
PATIENT: Everywhere, I suppose. Though… my hands, perhaps a little more noticeable? It’s difficult to say. I haven’t been meticulously examining myself, you see. I have… important things to attend to. Is this going to be a long procedure? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: It's important we get a complete picture, Mr. Drahota. I’m noting generalized skin darkening, more prominent on the hands. Aside from the skin changes and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. Let me think... No, I don't believe so. Perhaps a slight… ache in my joints now and again. Old age, again. And my appetite isn't what it used to be, but that’s probably my wife's cooking. Honestly, Doctor, are these relevant? This is all quite tedious. Is there a simple remedy, or must I endure a battery of tests?
DOCTOR: Joint aches and decreased appetite… We need to consider all possibilities, Mr. Drahota. To get a better understanding, can you describe the fatigue?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's… tiring. Exceedingly so. I find myself needing to rest after only a small amount of exertion. Used to be, I could work all day without a second thought. Now? It's simply dreadful. It's… debilitating. Do you need a list of chores I can no longer perform? Really, Doctor, it's self-evident. I just want to know if there’s a pill for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specifically triggered this fatigue or worsened it?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm... Well, the work has been… strenuous, lately. A lot of reinforcing iron, you see. Very heavy. But it’s work. A man must work. It shouldn't leave one utterly drained, should it? And the heat… the summer heat. But again, it's summer. I don't see what that has to do with anything. Are you suggesting I retire? Preposterous.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. I'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse and then take a look at your skin more closely. It's important we assess everything before drawing any conclusions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Get it over with, then. But be quick about it, if you please. My wife will be displeased if I'm late for tea. And try not to poke too much. I haven't the patience for prolonged examinations.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s examine your skin... I notice generalized hyperpigmentation, more pronounced on the dorsal surfaces of your hands and forearms. Skin feels warm and dry. No obvious lesions or rashes noted. Your skin is indeed warmer than expected. Do you typically feel warmer than other people?
PATIENT: Warmer? I haven't the foggiest idea, Doctor. I’m not constantly taking everyone’s temperature, you know. I simply… exist. If my wife remarks on it, perhaps. She notices these things. But I assure you, I don't spend my days monitoring my core temperature. Is this leading somewhere? Because frankly, I'm starting to feel rather… irritated. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, iron studies, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us identify the cause of your fatigue and skin changes. And to be on the safe side, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. Is that acceptable?
