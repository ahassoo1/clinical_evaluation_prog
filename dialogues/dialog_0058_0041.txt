DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I’m Dr. Todoroivich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this weakness. It keeps getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. Makes things… difficult. I’m Dorman, by the way. Most folks just call me Dorman.
DOCTOR: Right, Dorman. And how long has this weakness been… gradually worsening, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months now? It started in my legs, I think. Just a little bit of trouble walking long distances. Now it’s… well, it’s in my arms too, sometimes. Makes even simple things tiring, you know? I don’t keep close track of dates, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Six months. Alright. And can you describe this weakness more specifically?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I can’t move them, Doctor. It’s more like… they get heavy. Like trying to lift something really, really big, all the time. And sometimes… sometimes they feel numb. Not completely, just… not as strong as they used to be. It’s hard to explain. Like the power is… fading, little by little.
DOCTOR: “Fading,” alright. And is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It mostly comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. Like today, it’s not too bad. But after I’ve been up and about for a while, or if I try to do too much… that’s when it gets worse. And sometimes, in the evenings, it feels very heavy, almost like I can’t lift my arms at all. It’s unpredictable, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you notice anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Resting helps, of course. Sitting down for a bit, just taking the weight off my legs. And… sometimes, a warm bath. That seems to ease the aches a little. Not a cure, mind you, just… a little bit of relief. My wife, Leilani, she helps me with the warm baths. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my vision has been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to make me cautious when I’m driving. And… I get tired very easily. Even after a good night’s sleep, I feel like I’m dragging myself around. Leilani says I stumble more, too. I don’t always notice it myself, but she’s very observant.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, fatigue, stumbling… alright. Have you had any falls, Dorman?
PATIENT: Not bad falls, Doctor. Just little stumbles, you see? Losing my balance, mostly. Once, I tripped over the rug in the living room, but Leilani caught me. And another time, I nearly fell in the garden, but I grabbed onto the fence. Nothing broken, thank goodness. But they’ve been happening more often lately, which worries me. And worries Leilani, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a better look at things. Could you sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Just a little help, if you would be so kind? My legs aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and there’s some weakness in your grip and ankles. Not severe, but present. Let’s check your balance now. Could you stand up slowly when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. It's a little wobbly, you see. I don't like standing for too long these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. You do have some instability. Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Your heart sounds a little irregular, and there's some congestion in your lungs. It’s subtle, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Irregular, you say? Oh dear. I’ve been feeling a little breathless lately, especially when I walk up the stairs. But I thought it was just my age. Congestion in the lungs… have I caught a cold, Doctor? Leilani keeps telling me to rest more.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely to be a simple cold. Given your symptoms – the weakness, blurry vision, instability, irregular heartbeat, and congestion – I want to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. We need to rule out several possibilities. It could be a number of things, and I don’t want to jump to conclusions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything. Leilani keeps track of those things, and she would have told me if I did. She's very careful that way. Blood work and an X-ray… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now. The X-ray can be done here in the clinic. After we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on a plan. For now, I want you to take things easy, avoid strenuous activity, and follow up with me in a week, or sooner if your symptoms worsen. I'm also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation of the irregular heartbeat. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Take it easy, no strenuous activity, follow up in a week, and see a heart doctor. That’s a lot to take in, but I will do my best. Leilani will help me, of course. She always does. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. We'll get those tests ordered. And try not to worry too much before we have the results. Oh, and one last thing - please avoid driving until we get this sorted out. It's better to be safe.
PATIENT: No driving… alright. Yes, Doctor. I understand. Thank you again. .
