DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor Billman, I don't have time for this. I'm 51, perfectly healthy, and I want to know what needs to be done to… well, to make sure getting pregnant now isn't going to be a disaster. I don't want complications. I’ve read enough online to know age is a factor, but I expect a solution, not a lecture.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “perfectly healthy” is something we’ll need to confirm, of course. But I understand you’re concerned about age-related risks with pregnancy. It’s… ambitious, at your age, but not impossible. “Solution” is a strong word. We’re talking about minimizing risks, not guaranteeing a perfect outcome. Have you had any children previously?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. And frankly, that's none of your business why not. I simply want to know what tests are needed, what supplements I should be taking, and what the chances are of… you know, everything going smoothly. I don’t need a life story discussion. Just the facts, Doctor. Are we doing bloodwork, or what?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Direct and to the point, I see. Fine. Yes, bloodwork is absolutely necessary. We need a comprehensive panel to assess your overall health, hormone levels – to see if you’re even ovulating regularly – and check for any underlying conditions that could complicate a pregnancy. We'll also need to check your Rubella immunity. And a complete metabolic panel. Basic stuff. We’ll also want to do a pelvic exam. It's not just about bloodwork, you understand. We need to physically assess things. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Medications? Just a multivitamin, the basic kind. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been very careful with my health. I eat well, I exercise… I don't understand why you’re listing off every possible test under the sun. Is this just standard procedure, or are you already anticipating problems? Because if you think I'm going to be told I’m too old for this, you can just save your breath.
DOCTOR: Anticipating problems isn't the goal, Ms. Shteynberg. Ruling them out is. It’s responsible medical practice. And frankly, age is a significant factor. It’s not about judgment, it’s about increased risk. We need a baseline. Increased risk of gestational diabetes, hypertension, chromosomal abnormalities… the list goes on. We aren’t trying to discourage you, we are trying to prepare you and minimize those risks. Multivitamins are good, but they aren’t enough. Before we get ahead of ourselves, let's start with the bloodwork and pelvic exam. Then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you consent to those tests?
PATIENT: Oh, so now it is about my age. I knew it. Fine. Yes, do your tests. Get it over with. But don’t try to scare me with a list of worst-case scenarios before I even have results. And if you need to explain everything in layman's terms, please do. I don’t need a medical degree to understand my own body. Just… hurry up, alright? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and prepare you for the pelvic exam. It’s a standard exam, nothing to be alarmed about. We’ll check your vital signs first, then proceed. As for “layman’s terms,” I will endeavor to be clear, though I will not dumb down important medical information. And yes, I understand your time is valuable. We will be as efficient as possible. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No. Just… get on with it. And please have the nurse be quick. I dislike needles. Honestly, this whole process is rather… inefficient. .
DOCTOR: Right. Efficient… Some people. .
