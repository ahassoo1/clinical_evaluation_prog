DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Iuzzolino, is it? Fancy name. Well, frankly, I don't much care for all this poking and prodding. My niece insisted I come. Said I needed to get my… feet looked at. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Wynell, Iuzzolino. It is a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
PATIENT: You could say that. All these young people with their complicated names. Back in my day, things were simpler. Anyway, what’s the point of all this, Doctor? I haven't got all day, you know. And frankly, I don't see what a doctor needs with my feet.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. Your niece brought you in, and you're feeling well, so it sounds like we're doing a bit of a check-up, just to be sure. Sometimes, even when we feel okay, there can be things going on that are worth looking at. It’s good to catch things early. Now, regarding your feet... is there anything specific your niece mentioned that was concerning?
PATIENT: Oh, that girl… always fussing. She said something about… swelling, I think? And maybe… color? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to my feet. They get me where I need to go, that’s about it. I mostly wear these comfortable slippers. Never had any trouble with them, and I certainly don’t need a doctor telling me what’s wrong with perfectly good slippers.
DOCTOR: Swelling and color… alright. And you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Oh, goodness. Time just… slips away, you know? Maybe a few weeks? A month? It’s all a blur, really. I mostly just try to keep busy, don’t spend much time looking at my extremities. Honestly, I’m not sure what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: I understand. Time does slip away. Just to get a better picture, Wynell, have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Pain? Goodness, no. A little ache now and then, maybe. But I’m 83 years old, Doctor! A little ache is to be expected. I’ve lived a life, you know? I certainly haven’t spent it sitting around coddling my feet. Besides, a little warm water usually takes care of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little ache now and then, relieved with warm water. And have you noticed any changes in your skin – any dryness, cracks, or sores on your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're just picking at things! Dryness… well, my skin is a little dry everywhere at my age. It’s the weather, I suppose. And cracks… maybe a little around my heels, but I put lotion on. Mostly. It’s not like I have time to constantly be fussing over them, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some dryness and occasional cracks, managed with lotion. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your feet, if that's alright with you. Just a simple exam to see what's going on. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, Doctor, I came here to avoid this. My niece will be thrilled. Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle! I don't want any unnecessary poking around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick and gentle, I promise. If you could just sit here for me, please. I’ll just take a look. Alright, Wynell, I see some mild swelling in both feet, particularly around the ankles. The skin is a bit dry, as you mentioned, and there are a few small cracks on your heels. The color looks normal, although there’s a bit of discoloration around one of your toenails – it might just be age-related, but we should keep an eye on it. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. I’m also noticing some decreased sensation in your feet.
PATIENT: Decreased… what now? Look, Doctor, I’m not a medical person. You’re using all these fancy words. What does any of this mean? And weak pulses? That sounds dreadful! My niece is going to have a fit if you tell her I have weak pulses. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. I walk just fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell, let’s break that down. “Decreased sensation” means you might not feel things as strongly in your feet as you used to. It’s common with age, but we want to make sure it’s not something more serious. And “weak pulses” simply means the blood flow to your feet isn't as strong as it used to be, but it's still present. It can be a sign of circulation issues, which is why we want to be cautious. Now, walking just fine is good, and that’s important. But these things, the sensation and the pulses, are why I’d like to order a couple of tests just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, now you want to run tests! Honestly, Doctor, I came here to avoid tests. I have no patience for all this poking and prodding. My niece will be insufferable if she finds out. Can’t you just tell me I’m fine and send me home? I have better things to do than spend my days in a doctor's office. Honestly, I suspect this is just a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. And I truly wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were worthwhile. We're not necessarily looking for anything serious, but these tests – a simple blood test to check your circulation, and a nerve conduction study to see how well the signals are traveling to your feet – will give us a clearer picture. It’s always best to rule things out, especially considering the decreased sensation and weaker pulses. If we don't look into it, and something is going on, it could become a bigger problem down the road. Would you be open to discussing it with your niece?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want me to involve her? That girl… she'll have me scheduled for every test under the sun! Honestly, Doctor, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions. And I'm telling you, I don't want any tests. None. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I respect your decision. However, I do want to emphasize that declining these tests means we won’t have a complete picture of what’s going on. It’s your health, and ultimately, the decision is yours. I recommend that you continue to monitor your feet for any changes – increased swelling, pain, sores that don’t heal, or any further decrease in sensation. And if you do experience any of those things, please don’t hesitate to come back in or see another doctor. .
