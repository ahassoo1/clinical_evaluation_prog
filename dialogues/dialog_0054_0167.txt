DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my foot, you see. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. A sore, it is. A bad one. It won’t seem to get better, no matter what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s not healing. I understand. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Near my toes. It started small, just a little red spot, I think. Now… now it’s bigger. And it hurts when I walk. Especially when I put my weight on it. It's been like this for maybe... a month? Hard to say exactly, time goes by quickly when you're old like me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. A month is good to know. And you said it's near your toes, on the bottom of your foot, and it's painful with weight-bearing. Has it changed in appearance at all since it started?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. It’s… deeper now, I think. And… it smells a little funny, if I’m being honest. Not good smelling, you understand. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a little bit of… yellow stuff in it. I try to keep it clean, but it still happens. I don’t know what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Stoegbauer. The fact that it's deeper, has a smell, and is producing yellow fluid is important information. It sounds like it might be infected. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything like iodine?
PATIENT: Iodine… hmm. I don't think so, Doctor. But my memory… it's not what it used to be. I had a rash once, a long time ago, after a shot, but I don't remember what was in the shot. No other allergies I know of. I've never had trouble with any medicines before, but like I say, that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. We'll proceed cautiously with that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ones the doctor gave me for my… sugar. You know, for the diabetes. Little white pills, I take them every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are really bothering me, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think it is. The kind you can buy at the store. Not every day, just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you're taking medication for diabetes and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Thank you for telling me. Now, Mr. Stoegbauer, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoes and socks so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That's alright. There we go. Be gentle now, it's a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the sore here, near the base of your toes. It’s roughly circular, about a centimeter in diameter, and there’s some redness surrounding it. The skin is quite firm, and as you said, it does appear sensitive to the touch. There's some yellowish discharge present, and I do detect a slight odor. I’m also noticing some surrounding calluses. Mr. Stoegbauer, based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, this looks like a developing foot ulcer, likely complicated by an infection. Given your diabetes, it’s important to address this promptly to prevent further complications. Do you have a history of foot ulcers or any problems with circulation in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Ulcer, you say? That doesn’t sound good. No, Doctor, I don't think I’ve ever had one before. Not that I remember, anyway. My circulation… well, my legs get tired when I walk a long ways. And sometimes they feel a little cold, even when it’s warm out. But I just figured that was because I'm old! I haven’t been to a doctor about it, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. The tiredness and coldness could be signs of some circulation issues, and given your diabetes, it’s important we investigate that further. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to check the circulation in your feet. I'm going to use a device called a Doppler to listen to the pulses in your feet, and then I'll do a quick test to see how quickly blood flows back into your feet after I press on them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A Doppler, you say? Sounds a bit fancy. If it will help, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just… try to be quick, if you can. It makes me a little nervous when someone pokes around on my feet.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, the pulses in your feet are present, but they are somewhat diminished compared to what I’d expect. The capillary refill is a little slow as well, which suggests some reduced circulation. Given these findings, along with the ulcer and the signs of infection, I'm concerned that this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed right away. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray… Oh my. It sounds like a lot, Doctor. But if that's what you think is best, then yes. Do what you need to do. I just want this sore to get better. I don’t like being in pain, and I want to be able to walk again without hurting. So yes, do the tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. While we're waiting for the results, it's important to keep weight off your foot as much as possible. I'm going to prescribe you a pair of special shoes with a removable insole to help relieve pressure. I’m also going to recommend a course of antibiotics to fight the infection. Additionally, given your diabetes and the potential circulation issues, I’d like to refer you to a podiatrist and a vascular specialist for further evaluation and management. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Special shoes, antibiotics, and… podiatrist and vascular specialist? That’s a lot of doctors, Doctor. But… if it will help my foot, then yes. Do what you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please explain things to me slowly, if you don't mind. All this is a bit overwhelming for an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Stoegbauer, I completely understand. It can be overwhelming. I'll explain everything as slowly and clearly as I can. The special shoes will help take pressure off the sore on your foot, allowing it to heal. The antibiotics will fight the infection. A podiatrist is a doctor who specializes in foot care. They can help us manage the ulcer specifically, keep it clean, and ensure it's healing properly. The vascular specialist will assess the circulation in your legs and feet and determine if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed. We're taking these steps to ensure we address all aspects of the problem and prevent any further complications. While we're waiting for the results and specialist appointments, it’s very important to keep your blood sugar under control, as high blood sugar can slow down healing and worsen the infection. Are you currently monitoring your blood sugar levels at home?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. I check it every morning and every evening. I have a little machine. It tells me a number. I try to keep it in the… the green zone, like the nurse told me. Sometimes it’s a little high, but I usually take an extra pill if that happens. I write the numbers down in a little book. Would you like to see the numbers?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, that would be very helpful. Please, if you could show me the notebook, that would give me a better idea of how well your blood sugar is controlled.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. Like I said, I try my best. But sometimes… sometimes it's hard. Especially when I get nervous. Or if I eat something sweet.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. This is very helpful. I see that you’re generally keeping your blood sugar within a good range, but there are a few instances where it’s elevated. As you mentioned, this can happen when you're nervous or eat something sweet. It's good that you're adjusting your medication when this happens. However, consistently elevated blood sugar can significantly slow down the healing process and increase the risk of infection. I’m going to slightly adjust your diabetes medication dosage to try and maintain more stable levels. I’ll write out a new prescription for you. To summarize, we’re going to order blood tests and an X-ray, prescribe special shoes and antibiotics, refer you to a podiatrist and vascular specialist, and adjust your diabetes medication. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: So many things, Doctor! The… podiatrist, will they be here at this clinic? And the vascular specialist… what exactly do they do? Is it going to be painful? And… will this mean I can't walk at all? I like to go for little walks in the mornings, you see. It's good for my soul.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's good that you're asking them. The podiatrist is not here at this clinic, unfortunately. I’ll give you a referral to a podiatrist nearby. They specialize in foot care, and they’ll be able to help us manage the ulcer directly, keeping it clean and dressed. The vascular specialist will perform some tests to assess the blood flow in your legs and feet. They might use an ultrasound or other imaging techniques. They’ll determine if there are any blockages or other issues affecting circulation. It’s generally not painful – the tests are non-invasive. As for walking, we don’t want you to walk normally until the ulcer has started to heal. We’ll need to offload pressure from your foot as much as possible, which is why I’m prescribing the special shoes. Once the ulcer improves, the podiatrist will advise you on a gradual return to walking. It’s possible we can modify your walking routine to minimize pressure on your foot. Does that help clarify things a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… a little better. The special shoes sound good. And the podiatrist not being here… that's alright, I guess. As long as they know what they're doing. And no painful tests, that's good. What about the antibiotics? Will they make me sick to my stomach? My neighbor, Mrs. Kapule, she took antibiotics once and… well, she wasn’t feeling very well for a few days.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Stoegbauer. Some antibiotics can cause nausea or stomach upset, but it doesn't happen to everyone. The antibiotic I’m prescribing is generally well-tolerated. To minimize any potential side effects, I recommend taking the medication with food. If you do experience nausea or any other stomach problems, please let me know right away, and we can discuss options to help manage it. There are medications we can prescribe to prevent nausea, and we can also consider switching to a different antibiotic if necessary. It's important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Are there any other concerns you have right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You've answered all my questions, I think. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. So… I just need to wait for the tests, and then I’ll get a call from the podiatrist? And the new prescription for the sugar pills?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm ordering the tests right now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, I'll review them and discuss them with you. The podiatrist's office will also contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I'm sending the prescription for your diabetes medication to your usual pharmacy electronically, so it should be ready for pickup shortly. I’ll also make sure to send a summary of today’s visit to your primary care physician. Do you have any questions about where the lab is located, or how to reach the podiatrist’s office?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good, Doctor. I know where the lab is. And you'll give me the podiatrist’s number before I leave? That would be helpful. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You've put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. Here you go. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. We're here to support you. I'm going to have the nurse come in and give you some written instructions about wound care and taking your medications. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. Thank you again for everything. You're a good doctor. I think I'll go home now and rest. And try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Stoegbauer. Rest is good. And don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. .
