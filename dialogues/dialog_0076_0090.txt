DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Brightful. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hello Doctor Ruocco. It's… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe I have some paperwork somewhere… It’s for a clearance, a pre-surgery check-up. My insurance requires it, I think. It’s all a little… hazy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Insurance… always with the paperwork. Look, let’s just start with why you need this surgery. What are they planning to operate on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… it’s my face. I… I want some things… adjusted. It was my husband’s wish, actually. He… he always thought… well, never mind. It’s a cosmetic thing. Not urgent, but… important to me. I don't recall the specific name of the procedure, I'm afraid. It was discussed with the surgeon, Dr. Alvarez, a while ago now.
DOCTOR: Right. "Adjusted." And this husband of yours… he’s the primary reason you’re pursuing this?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not primary, exactly. He… he just had a very strong aesthetic sense. He always wanted me to look… my best. But it's something I want now, too. After… everything. It feels like a good way to… move forward, if that makes sense? It's complicated. He passed away about six months ago. It’s all been a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Six months ago… right. And you’re seeking cosmetic surgery… as part of, shall we say, a… transition?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds right. A transition. It feels… strange to put it that way, but yes. He always talked about it, how much happier it would make me. And now… well, I think I need something to focus on. Something positive. It's not that I have to do it, it's just… a hope, I guess. Does that make sense? I’m probably not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, I understand grief can… motivate people. But we still need to assess if you’re medically fit for any procedure. Before we get into your emotional state, let’s just run through a basic medical history. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Allergies. Let me think… I believe I’m allergic to penicillin. And… dust, a little. It makes me sneeze. Not a serious allergy, though. I don't carry an EpiPen or anything. Is there a specific form I should be filling out? My memory hasn't been the best lately. It's… disconcerting, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Penicillin, dust… right. And any other medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is. A small dose. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches. But not regularly. I’m usually pretty good about avoiding medication, if I can. Is this helpful? I apologize for being so disorganized.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… I think I had a wisdom tooth removed once. That’s it, I believe. Nothing major. No cosmetic procedures before, definitely. This would be… new territory for me. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Tonsils, wisdom tooth… fine. Now, family history. Any significant illnesses run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s tricky. My family is… was… large. Lots of cousins. My mother had… high blood pressure, like me. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had diabetes. I think. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about those things much. There was a lot of… keeping things to ourselves. It’s hard to remember details, I'm afraid. I wish I had more concrete information for you.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on to you. Any current medical problems you’re dealing with, aside from the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really. I get… tired sometimes. But everyone does, right? And my back aches a little, especially after gardening. I work outdoors quite a bit, landscaping. It’s… physical work. Nothing debilitating, though. I just… take it easy when I need to. I try to stay active, despite everything. It keeps me… grounded. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Grounded. Right. And what about your weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… That’s… a sensitive question, Doctor. I’ve… gained a little weight since my husband passed. It’s hard to eat properly when you’re… grieving, I suppose. I’m about… 150 pounds. And I’m… not very tall. Maybe five foot two? I apologize for being so imprecise. I’m not usually this… scattered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Height 155cm, weight 68kg. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just basic vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit here and relax. And try not to worry. This is routine.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam. That makes sense. I… I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Though… I must confess, I always feel a little anxious at the doctor's office. It brings back… memories. But I’ll try my best to relax. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, but you have a slight wheeze. You’re slightly overweight, as we discussed, and your BMI is 27.7, placing you in the overweight category. Do you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Oh, um… no, not really. No chest pain. Sometimes, if I'm doing a lot of heavy work in the garden, I might feel a little… winded. But that’s probably just from exertion. And the wheezing… I do get… a little bit of a cough sometimes, especially in the spring. Allergies, I suppose? It's not usually serious enough to see a doctor, though. I just take some over-the-counter medication and it clears up. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Brightful, your blood pressure is elevated, you're overweight, and you have a history of wheezing. While your desire for cosmetic surgery is… understandable, your overall health is not optimal. We need to get this under control before considering any elective procedures. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist and a pulmonologist. We need to rule out any underlying heart or lung conditions. And I’m going to recommend a weight management program. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, I see. So… you’re saying I can’t have the surgery right now? I understand. I… I just wanted to… feel a little better about myself. But you’re right, of course. Health comes first. A cardiologist and a pulmonologist… and a weight management program. Yes, I understand. Can you… can you give me some referrals? It all feels a bit… overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Here. Cardiologist Dr. Ramirez, Pulmonologist Dr. Chen. I'm also including a list of local weight management programs. Look, Ms. Brightful, I understand this isn’t what you wanted to hear, but this is responsible care. Once your health is stabilized, we can revisit the possibility of elective surgery. In the meantime, please schedule these appointments as soon as possible. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant changes in your condition, go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. This… this is a lot to take in. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you for being honest with me. And for… for explaining everything. I’ll schedule those appointments right away. I appreciate your time, Doctor Ruocco. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Take care of yourself, Ms. Brightful. .
