DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's…fine. My wife, she made the appointment. Said I've been…scattered lately. Honestly, I feel alright. A bit…forgetful, maybe, but who doesn’t forget things at my age? It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common to experience some memory changes as we get older, and it’s good your wife is attentive. Still, it's always wise to investigate. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "scattered?
PATIENT: Scatterred… well, like I’ll be doing something – fixing a tile, for instance – and I just…stop. Not stop stop, like I can't move, but stop thinking. I know what I was doing, I see the tile, I have the tools, but… the next step just…isn’t there. Then it comes back, usually, but it’s… unnerving. And sometimes, I ask my wife about things that happened yesterday, and I know I was there, but the details are…fuzzy. It’s not like I don’t know who she is, you understand. It’s just…pieces missing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Mr. Lason. That sounds quite concerning, and it’s good you’re able to describe it so clearly. It's helpful to know it's not a complete loss of memory, but rather difficulty recalling recent events or a temporary break in thought. To get a better sense of what might be going on, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major. My knees, they ache something fierce when it rains, so the doctor gave me some pills for that a few years back. And high blood pressure, I think they said. I take a little orange pill for that every morning. That’s about it, really. I’ve always been a strong man, worked hard my whole life. Tile setting isn’t easy, you know. Keeps a man busy. And my wife, she manages the rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and high blood pressure. That's helpful. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… orange. Small, orange pill. She fills the little box for me, every month. I… I don't really look at the name, honestly. She just tells me to take one every morning with my coffee. It starts with an 'A', maybe? Or a 'B'? Honestly, Doctor, I leave all that to my wife. She’s the organized one. I just take the pills when she gives them to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. We can certainly clarify that with your wife or the pharmacy later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a broken bone. A few cuts and scrapes from the tile work, naturally. But nothing that required a hospital. I’ve always been careful, and I've always been strong. My father, he used to say a strong back and a strong mind is all a man needs.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone in your family—parents, siblings, or even cousins—who has experienced memory problems, dementia, or any similar conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she got a little confused towards the end. Not like she didn't know us, but she would repeat herself a lot. And sometimes, she wouldn't remember where she put things. My wife said it was just old age. My father… he was always sharp as a tack, right up until the day he died. Never forgot a thing. As for siblings… I have a younger sister, but we haven't spoken in years. She moved to America a long time ago. I doubt she'd know anything about my medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, some confusion in your mother, but a clear mind in your father. Thank you. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work. Hard. Six days a week, usually. Tile setting. I eat what my wife cooks – mostly Cambodian food. Fish, rice, vegetables. Nothing fancy. We don't drink much, maybe a small glass of beer with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I’m a simple man, Doctor. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Just one more thing, regarding medications - aside from the orange pill for blood pressure and anything for your knees, are you taking any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Vitamins… my wife gave me some fish oil a while back. Said it was good for the brain. I took them for a bit, but honestly, I forgot. And sometimes, I take something for heartburn. It’s… a white chewable tablet. When I eat something spicy. That’s it, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I try not to take too many pills. Makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you wouldn’t mind. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment – to see how things are functioning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need. Just get it over with, quickly. I have tiles to set tomorrow, you know. And my wife will be expecting me home at a reasonable hour.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, Mr. Lason. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s not unexpected. Your reflexes and coordination are generally good, although your balance is a little unsteady. And, as we discussed, your short-term memory seems to be mildly affected. I also noted some mild difficulty with your balance. Do you feel unsteady on your feet often, or is this a new symptom?
PATIENT: Unsteady… sometimes. It’s… hard to explain. Like I’m a little off. Not falling or anything, but… like I’m floating a bit. I thought it was just my age, you know? Old knees, maybe. It’s been getting worse lately, I suppose. Just a little bit. Enough to make my wife fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Given your symptoms—the recent memory changes, the difficulty with balance, and the elevated blood pressure—I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to your blood pressure, but the memory issues suggest we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood work to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes. And I’d also like to recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural problems. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: An MRI? What for? Is something wrong? I told you, I just forget things! A little bit unsteady. It’s not like I'm… decaying! Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. And those machines… they look dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. An MRI is simply a way for us to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your brain. It’s non-invasive, meaning we don’t have to poke or prod. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images, and it’s a very safe procedure. It’s not necessarily that I think something is terribly wrong, but given your symptoms, it's important to rule out any potential causes. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or it could be something more serious, like a small stroke or early signs of dementia. The MRI will help us determine the cause and develop the appropriate treatment plan. Would you prefer to discuss this with your wife before making a decision?
PATIENT: Fine. Discuss it with my wife. She always has an opinion. And she’ll probably say yes, because she likes doctors poking around in everything. But honestly, Doctor, I still think it’s a waste of time and money. I just want a pill to fix my memory, not a… a brain scan.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Lason. And I appreciate you being honest with me. We can certainly discuss your options with your wife. In the meantime, I'm going to write a prescription for a low-dose vitamin D supplement, as many people with memory issues have a deficiency. I'll also recommend following a healthy diet and getting regular exercise, as these can both improve brain health. And, as a precaution, I'm going to advise you to avoid driving until we have more information. I know that may be difficult, but your safety is my top priority. I’ll have my nurse print out some information about vitamin D and a list of local resources for senior care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No driving? Now you are being ridiculous. I've been driving for fifty years! Fifty years! I can still handle a car perfectly well. I suppose… I suppose I can ask my wife to drive me to the grocery store. Look, just… just get the tests done, okay? And don't tell me I can't drive. She'll hear about it, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. We'll get the tests scheduled as soon as possible. And I will be sure to respect your concerns. I will note in your chart that you are an experienced driver, and we will reassess your ability to drive after we have the results. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and schedule the blood work and MRI. She will also provide you with some information about local resources for senior care and support groups. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s enough for now. Just get it done quickly, okay? And try not to make me feel like I’m falling apart. I feel… fine. Mostly. .
