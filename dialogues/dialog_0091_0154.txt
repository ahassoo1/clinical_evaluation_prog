DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re a new patient to the clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. Yes, new patient, that’s right. Um… it’s my… waterworks. They bother me. A lot. I keep getting… trouble with them. It’s… unpleasant. I don't really understand why, and frankly, I'd like to get this sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wease. “Trouble with your waterworks” – I understand that can be quite distressing. To help me understand what’s going on, could you be a little more specific about the trouble you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, I go to the… the little girls’ room, very often. And it… burns. It burns when I… go. And sometimes, even when I don't go, it burns. It's happened on and off for… a while now. Months, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s very bothersome, that’s what it is. And I feel… weak sometimes, after. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Ms. Wease. The burning sensation and frequent urination are certainly concerning, and the weakness you experience afterward is something we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how often you’re urinating throughout the day, and how much you typically drink each day?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult question. I drink… tea, mostly. Several cups. And water, when I remember. As for how often… goodness. More than usual, I suppose. Every couple of hours, maybe? Sometimes more. It feels like… I can’t go a long time without needing to go. It interrupts everything. I really don’t keep track of these things, Doctor. I just know it's… frequent. And bothersome. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Wease. It sounds like you’re experiencing urinary frequency, and the burning sensation suggests possible irritation or infection. Now, to understand the full picture, let’s briefly go through some other areas. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… now that you mention it… I think I saw a little… once. A very small amount. It was a long time ago, though. I didn’t think much of it at the time. Just a little pinkish tinge. It didn't happen again. I… I really don't pay close attention to those things, Doctor. I just want this burning to stop, if I'm being honest. It’s very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wease. The intermittent pinkish tinge, combined with the burning and frequency, does warrant further investigation. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't taken my temperature. Chills… no, not really. Sometimes I feel a bit… cold, but that’s usually just the air conditioning. And back pain… well, I’m an old woman, Doctor. My back always aches a little. It’s just… old age. I don't think it's related to… this. Honestly, I just want to know what’s causing the burning. And if you can fix it. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that is not too much to ask at all, Ms. Wease. We’ll certainly try to determine the cause of your symptoms and find a solution. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems – that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That was a long time ago, Doctor. Let me see… I had a… a bad gallbladder, once. They took it out. And my blood pressure… the doctor said it was a little high, years ago, but I don’t take any pills for it. Just… watch my salt, he said. And… no, I don't think I have any kidney problems. I don’t remember anyone ever saying anything about my kidneys. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. My late husband… he was always the one to remember these things. I really don’t keep track of doctor’s visits and… conditions and… everything. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wease. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the history of slightly elevated blood pressure is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. When it’s really bothering me. But I don’t take it very often. And… no vitamins. I tried them once, but I couldn’t remember to take them. And no herbal… what did you call them? Supplements? No. Just the ibuprofen, sometimes. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills if possible. They never seem to do much good anyway. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wease, that’s not too much to ask at all. Knowing about the occasional ibuprofen use is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat… most things. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just… dry skin, I think. No, I don't think I have any allergies. My late husband was allergic to… cats, I think. But I'm not allergic to anything. As far as I know, anyway. Honestly, I really don’t pay much attention to these things. Is that helpful? I'm ready for this to be over, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. It sounds like you don't have any known allergies, which is good. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That was a long time ago, Doctor. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he smoked a lot. He had… lung trouble, I think. And… no, I don’t really know much about my family history. My late husband was the one who knew all of that. Honestly, it’s all very blurry. Is this important? I just want to know what’s causing this burning sensation. I really do.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Ms. Wease, thank you. Family history can sometimes provide clues, but it’s alright that you don’t have a lot of details. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I would like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my. Recreational… drugs? Heavens no! Never. I used to drink a little wine with dinner, years ago. But I stopped that a long time ago. And I never smoked. Never had any interest in it. My late husband… he smoked, but I didn't. No, I don't do any of those things. Honestly, I'm a very… a very simple woman. I just want this burning to stop, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? I'm ready for this to be over.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Wease, that’s not too much to ask at all. Knowing about your lifestyle is helpful. Alright. Given your symptoms – the frequent urination, burning sensation, and intermittent pink tinge – and your medical history, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical examination? Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have… things to do. And I really don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. But please be gentle, Doctor. And quick. I’m not as young as I used to be. And frankly, this whole process is rather… unsettling. But I trust your judgment. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We'll start with checking your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I will listen to your abdomen and back with my stethoscope. Finally, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam and check your reflexes. It will only take a few minutes. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’ll listen to your abdomen. "Everything sounds normal here. No unusual sounds or tenderness." "And your lungs sound clear as well. No wheezing or crackles."
PATIENT: Oh… good. Everything sounds normal. That’s… reassuring. It’s just this burning… it’s so unpleasant. And it’s… constant. Almost. I’m glad your… machine didn’t find anything wrong. Honestly, I was rather nervous. This whole process is… unsettling. But I appreciate your… gentleness. Can we… be done soon? I have… a casserole to make. And I need to… rest. This is rather tiring.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wease. It's good to hear everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’d like to perform a simple neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. It's very quick. I'll gently tap your knees with this little hammer. "Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. No abnormalities detected there either." Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, your symptoms suggest a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to confirm this, we'll need to perform a urine test to look for bacteria. I’d also like to do a simple blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other possible causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine test? And a blood test? Heavens. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, I just want this burning to stop. I don't understand why everything is so complicated. A simple remedy… is that not possible? I'm not good with tests and… machines and… all of this. But… if it’s the only way to find out what’s wrong… yes, alright. But please be quick. And gentle. I really do appreciate your… gentleness. I’m ready to go home now. And make my casserole. Can we… hurry this up?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wease. I wish we could simply provide a quick remedy, but it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis before starting any treatment. The tests are relatively quick and painless. Nurse, could you please assist Ms. Wease with collecting a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh… a sample. Yes, alright. Just… tell me where to go. And… please be discreet. This is rather… embarrassing. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not as young as I used to be. And I'm not as… agile, either. Please… just make it quick. And gentle. I just want this burning to stop. And make my casserole. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wease. The nurse will escort you to the restroom, and provide you with a sterile cup. She will explain everything. Once you’ve collected the sample, she will take it to the lab for analysis. Nurse, could you please take Ms. Wease to collect a urine sample?
