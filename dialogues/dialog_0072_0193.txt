DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Hembrey. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it’s… the gas. Too much gas. It is, how you say, excessive. It makes me… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excessive gas, alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, but now it’s… quite frequent. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it is… embarrassing. And sometimes a little… loud.
DOCTOR: Six months. And has anything changed in the six months prior to the start of this?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Let me see… not really. I eat the same things, I go to work at the burger place like always… Oh! Wait. They did change the beans they use for the chili. About six months ago. Could it be the beans? I eat the chili almost every day with my lunch.
DOCTOR: The chili… and a change in the beans. Interesting. And how much chili would you say you consume per day, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, not so much. Maybe… one and a half cups? Sometimes two, if I am very hungry. Is that a lot of chili, Doctor? I just like the taste. It is good chili, even with the… problem.
DOCTOR: One and a half to two cups daily. Right. And outside of the chili, are you experiencing any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: No, not really. No stomach pain, no… problems with going to the bathroom. Just the gas. And a little… bloating sometimes, after I eat. But it goes away. It is mostly just… the gas, Doctor. It is very disruptive. I worry about it when I am at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Just Medicare, you know, for… general things. I try to stay healthy. I walk to work every day, if the weather is nice. I do not like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: No current medications noted, and you’ve indicated no allergies. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your diet generally, beyond the chili. Do you consume a lot of dairy?
PATIENT: Dairy… hmm. Not so much, I think. Maybe a little milk with my breakfast sometimes. A little cheese. But not a lot. I do not drink milk all the time. Is dairy a problem, Doctor? I like cheese, but I could… try to eat less if it would help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about carbonated beverages?
PATIENT: Carbonated beverages… you mean like… soda? I drink maybe one can of cola a week. Sometimes none. I prefer water, usually. Water is good. And less sweet, you know? I try not to drink too much sugar.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Please relax. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. It feels… normal. A little pressure, perhaps, but no pain. I can feel your hand, of course, but it does not hurt. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: No acute tenderness noted on palpation. Given your history, and the lack of other significant symptoms, it sounds like we're dealing with excessive gas likely related to your diet. Specifically, the beans in the chili. It's a fairly common issue. However, to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check for any underlying issues. It's just a precaution. We'll also run a stool sample, to check for any bacterial imbalances.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I do not mind a blood test, if it will help. And the… stool sample? Is that… unpleasant? I do not like thinking about that part. But if you think it is necessary… I will do it. I want to stop the gas, you know? It is very bothersome.
DOCTOR: The stool sample isn’t pleasant, no, I won't pretend it is. But it's a very straightforward collection, and the lab will provide clear instructions. It’s a necessary step to ensure we’ve ruled out any underlying causes. I'll have the lab technician explain the process to you in detail. I'm also going to recommend, for the next week, that you significantly reduce your chili consumption. Perhaps try it only once or twice. And see if that makes a difference. If the blood and stool tests are normal, and reducing the chili helps, then that’s likely the culprit. If not, then we’ll need to explore other options. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reasonable. I can try to eat less chili. It will be difficult, because I like it very much. But I want to feel better. So, less chili, blood test, and… the stool sample. I will do everything you say. Thank you, Doctor. And when can I have the tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and stool sample. The blood work can be done at any Quest Diagnostics location – there’s one just down the street, actually. You don't need an appointment. As for the stool sample, the lab technician will give you the container and instructions. They’ll explain everything. Try to collect it as soon as possible after I recommend for it. Once the results are back – usually within 3-5 business days – my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I understand everything. Less chili, tests, and then follow up. You have been very helpful. And very patient with me. I appreciate it very much. I will go get the tests done right away. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I hope you find some relief soon. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And yes, do have a good day. .
