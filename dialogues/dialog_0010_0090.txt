DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I need to get cleared for it first, I understand? It’s… a cosmetic procedure. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the specifics right now.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to apologize at all, Ms. Brightful – memory can be tricky. We’ll take things at your pace. So, you're hoping to get medical clearance for a cosmetic surgery. Can you tell me what type of procedure you are considering?
PATIENT: Um… it was… something to do with my stomach. I believe it was to remove excess skin? After… after losing some weight. It was recommended by a specialist, a doctor Ramirez, I think. I just need to be sure I’m healthy enough to go through with it. It's been a while since I saw him, and even longer since I’ve had a full check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a panniculectomy – removal of excess skin on the abdomen, often after significant weight loss. That makes sense. And you saw Dr. Ramirez for the consultation regarding that. To get a better picture of your overall health, and ensure you are a suitable candidate for surgery, let's go through a bit of your medical history. First, have you had any serious illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… That's difficult. I… I do remember being quite unwell a few years ago, but I'm afraid the details are hazy. It involved a lot of tests, and I was in the hospital for a short time. It wasn't… pleasant. But what for, exactly… I truly can’t recall. And before that… I believe I was generally quite healthy. My husband… he always took care of things like remembering dates and doctors' visits. It’s been hard adjusting without him.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and it’s common for things to feel blurry during times of grief. We can try to access your records to see if we can clarify what that hospitalization was for. Before we do that, let’s talk about any surgeries you do remember having. Have you had any operations in the past, aside from perhaps minor things like wisdom teeth removal?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, of course. And… I believe I had an appendectomy, many years ago. That was quite painful, I remember that distinctly. Oh, and… after I had my son, I had a C-section. Beyond that… I'm fairly certain there haven’t been any other major surgeries. It feels like a long time ago, though, so I could be mistaken. Would your records show all of these?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Brightful, your records should list those procedures. Let me pull them up... Okay, here we are. It confirms tonsillectomy as a child, appendectomy in 1998, and a C-section in 2015 with no reported complications. That aligns with what you’ve told me. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he passed away from a heart attack, quite suddenly. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. I'm not sure about much beyond that, to be honest. We weren’t very close, and health wasn’t something we discussed much. I apologize for being so vague. Is it important to know details further back?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Brightful. Knowing what you do know is helpful. Heart disease and diabetes are certainly important factors to consider. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, prescribed by my general practitioner. And… I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things topped up. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. That’s over-the-counter, of course. I don’t take anything else regularly. Do you need to know the names of the medications? My memory…
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. Lisinopril is good to know, and the ibuprofen, while over-the-counter, is helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I sometimes get a little itchy after eating shellfish, but it’s not severe enough to require medication. Just a mild irritation, really. I'm almost certain I don’t have any serious allergies, but I suppose it’s always possible. Would my records contain allergy information, as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, your records should list any known allergies. Okay, it does confirm a mild shellfish allergy. Noted. Now, Ms. Brightful, let’s talk about your social history, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to smoke, but he quit years ago, thankfully. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been quite health-conscious, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Brightful. Alright, one last question for this part. Can you tell me about your weight history?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… been a journey. I used to be much heavier. After my husband passed away, I… I wasn't taking care of myself. I gained a lot of weight. But about two years ago, I started to focus on my health again. I started eating better and exercising. I’ve lost a significant amount of weight since then, but it took a lot of effort. I don’t know the exact numbers, I’m afraid. It’s hard to remember. But I've been working hard to maintain it.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Ms. Brightful. It takes a great deal of strength and dedication to make those kinds of changes. I see you've lost approximately 50 pounds over the last two years, which is very commendable. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out. I hope everything is… suitable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Blood pressure is a little high today, 140 over 90. We can recheck it later. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft to the touch, no apparent tenderness or masses. Skin looks good, no concerning lesions. Overall, a fairly unremarkable exam, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, given your history and the exam findings, I recommend some blood work to assess your kidney function, liver function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. It will also help us understand why your blood pressure is a little high today. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I want to make sure I’m in the best possible health before proceeding with the surgery. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood work? Fasting, or…?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, for the most accurate results, I would like you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We'll give you a lab slip, and you can go to the lab located just down the street. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Twelve hours… alright, I can manage that. Um… yes, actually, I do have a question. If everything is suitable, and I proceed with the surgery… what is the typical recovery time? And what kind of pain can I expect? I’m… a little anxious about that part.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Brightful. Recovery time varies from person to person, but typically, for a panniculectomy, you can expect about 4-6 weeks for the major healing process. The first week is usually the most difficult, with significant pain and limited mobility. We’ll prescribe pain medication to help manage that. You’ll have bandages and possibly a drain, and we’ll need to see you for follow-up appointments to monitor your healing. You can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort for several weeks after that. The pain will gradually subside, but it’s important to follow our post-operative instructions carefully. We’ll provide you with a detailed list of those instructions after the surgery, including wound care, activity restrictions, and when to call the office. Do you want me to explain any of that in more detail?
PATIENT: No, that… that’s helpful, thank you. 4-6 weeks… I can work with that. Pain medication is reassuring. And… what are the risks involved? I know every surgery has them, but… I'd like to be fully informed. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That's a very important question, Ms. Brightful, and you're right to ask. As with any surgery, there are potential risks. The most common risks associated with a panniculectomy include infection, bleeding, hematoma , seroma , wound dehiscence , and poor wound healing. There's also a risk of nerve damage, which could cause numbness or changes in sensation. Skin necrosis – the death of skin tissue – is a rare but possible complication. And, of course, there’s always a risk of adverse reaction to anesthesia. We take several precautions to minimize these risks, including careful patient selection, meticulous surgical technique, and thorough post-operative care. We will discuss all of these risks in detail before the surgery, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you have. I'll provide you with a consent form outlining these risks as well. Now, let’s focus on getting those blood work results back so we can have a clearer picture of your health. If everything looks good, we can then proceed with a consultation with the surgeon to discuss the procedure in more detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable. Blood work first, then the surgeon. Could you please write down the name of the lab, just in case I forget? And… what is the best way to schedule an appointment with the surgeon once we have the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. The lab is called "Coastal Diagnostics," and the address is 123 Main Street, right down the road. As for scheduling an appointment with the surgeon, Dr. Ramirez, our office will contact you directly once your results are back. They will coordinate the appointment for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you so much for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow morning, and I’ll wait for your office to contact me. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
