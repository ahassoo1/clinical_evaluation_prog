DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A pleasure. Well, it’s rather a…sensitive matter, actually. I’ve been dabbling, shall we say, in some…rather adventurous diets lately. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I go any further. A bit of a review, if you will, to ensure I'm not doing myself any harm.
DOCTOR: "Adventurous diets," alright. I understand. It's good you're thinking proactively about your health, Mr. Vantine. Many people try different things, and it's always wise to check in with a doctor. Could you tell me a bit more about these diets?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, the most recent one…it involved primarily consuming only things that are purple. Yes, purple. Beetroot, plums, a rather alarming amount of elderberry juice…and a few other things I found. Before that, there was the ‘caveman’ approach, naturally, though I confess I did miss a good cup of tea terribly during that phase. And before that…oh dear, it's all a bit of a blur. Let’s just say it involved a great deal of broth. A great deal. I believe it was called the ‘Bone Broth Revival’, or something of that nature. It all sounded quite promising at the time, you see.
DOCTOR: Purple, caveman, and a bone broth revival… quite a variety! It sounds like you’ve been very dedicated to trying different approaches. And I appreciate you being so open about it. Let’s focus on the most recent one, the purple diet, for now. How long have you been following that diet, and what prompted you to start it?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s only been…approximately three weeks, I believe. Though time does rather slip away, doesn’t it? As to why…ah, yes. I was reading an article – online, naturally – about the supposed antioxidant properties of anthocyanins, which I’m told are particularly abundant in purple foods. It claimed all sorts of remarkable benefits – improved memory, increased vitality, a slowing of the aging process…you understand. A special effects artist does rather rely on a sharp mind, you see. And maintaining a youthful appearance is…beneficial, to put it mildly. It all seemed terribly logical at the time. Though I am starting to feel rather…monochromatic.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good to be proactive about health, and those articles can be very persuasive. And you're right, anthocyanins do have antioxidant properties. But relying on a single color group for all your nutrition can certainly lead to imbalances. You mentioned feeling “monochromatic”. Can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather difficult to articulate. It’s not merely a feeling of boredom with the colour palette, though that is certainly a factor. It’s more…a lack of oomph, shall we say. A certain…flatness. My energy levels aren’t quite what they were, and I’ve found myself requiring considerably more sleep. And, if I’m being perfectly honest, my digestion has become…unpredictable. Perhaps that’s too delicate a term. Let’s simply say it’s become rather…exciting. And I’ve developed a peculiar craving for…green vegetables. A rather alarming development, all things considered. I haven’t willingly consumed a green vegetable in…decades, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a clearer picture. Low energy, increased sleep, digestive issues, and a new craving for green vegetables…those are all things we need to address. Before we get into a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve generally been quite fortunate with my health, all things considered. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing particularly serious. I underwent an appendectomy in my early twenties, but that was…uneventful. In my forties, I had a rather nasty bout of influenza, but I recovered fully. I’ve always been reasonably active – walking, mostly – and I’ve never smoked or been a heavy drinker. I was briefly married, some years ago – a rather brief affair, to be truthful – but my ex-wife had rather…specific dietary requirements, which proved…incompatible with my preferences. As for allergies…I believe I’m mildly sensitive to dust mites, but it’s never been particularly troublesome. I do take a daily multivitamin, just as a precaution, and I occasionally indulge in a glass of sherry. A small glass, mind you. For medicinal purposes, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. No major health issues, appendectomy, influenza, mild dust mite allergy, daily multivitamin, occasional sherry…all good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a rather pertinent question, Doctor. Let me see…my father was a solicitor, and he lived to the ripe old age of eighty-seven. He was remarkably robust, actually, though he did develop a rather unfortunate fondness for biscuits in his later years. My mother, sadly, passed away at the age of sixty-two from…complications of the heart, I believe. It was a rather sudden affair. On my wife’s side…her father had diabetes, I recall, and her grandmother suffered from arthritis. She was a rather formidable woman, to be honest. And her aunt…ah, yes. She had a rather eccentric hobby involving the breeding of miniature goats, and she developed some sort of respiratory ailment, though I confess I never quite understood the details. It’s all rather…scattered in my memory, I’m afraid. Family gatherings were not terribly informative affairs. Mostly arguments about the proper way to brew tea. A rather serious topic, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Heart disease on your mother’s side, diabetes on your wife’s side…we’ll keep those in mind. Now, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as you know, I am a special effects artist and animator. It's a rather solitary profession, mostly spent in front of a computer screen, though occasionally it requires some rather…hands-on work. I live alone in a small flat in the city, which I find perfectly agreeable. I don't have any pets – they require too much attention, you see – and I rarely have visitors. I enjoy reading – mostly historical biographies and science fiction – and I occasionally attend the cinema, though the modern films are rarely to my taste. I tend to be a creature of habit – a rather predictable routine, if I'm being perfectly honest – and I don't travel much. I have a rather…aversion to air travel, you see. Too many germs, too little legroom, too much turbulence. A rather unpleasant experience, all things considered. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, as I’ve previously mentioned – Earl Grey, naturally – and I occasionally indulge in a biscuit or two. A small indulgence, mind you. For medicinal purposes, naturally. And I am rather fond of a good crossword puzzle. Keeps the mind sharp, you see. And I do occasionally dream of creating a truly spectacular explosion. A purely artistic endeavor, naturally. No harm intended.
DOCTOR: That paints a very clear picture, Mr. Vantine. Solitary profession, enjoys reading and cinema, prefers a predictable routine, crossword puzzles, and a good cup of tea…sounds like a fulfilling life, if a little quiet. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, other than the daily multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Just the multivitamin, as I mentioned. I've always been rather…averse to taking pills, you see. A rather…unpleasant sensation, all things considered. I prefer to rely on natural remedies whenever possible – a good cup of tea, a brisk walk, a good night's sleep – and I generally avoid doctors unless absolutely necessary. Which, admittedly, is why I’m here today. A rather unusual occurrence, all things considered. I believe the last time I visited a doctor was…oh dear, let me see…approximately ten years ago, I believe. A rather minor ailment, to be truthful. A rather persistent cough, I believe. And the doctor prescribed some sort of syrup, which tasted absolutely dreadful. A rather unpleasant experience, all things considered. So, no, Doctor, no other medications. Just the multivitamin, and a rather strong aversion to pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly clear. Just the multivitamin, and a preference for natural remedies. Well, Mr. Vantine, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything is immediately apparent. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I haven’t had a thorough physical examination in…well, decades, I suspect. I’m not terribly fond of being prodded and poked, you see, but I understand it’s necessary. I do have rather…sensitive skin, you see, so please be gentle. And if anything feels particularly…uncomfortable, please do let me know. I’m not terribly brave, you see, especially when it comes to medical procedures. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. And I appreciate your consideration. Please proceed at your own pace. And if you require me to remove any clothing, please do let me know in advance. I have rather…a particular fondness for this waistcoat, you see. A rather comfortable garment, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. I'll be as gentle as possible. And I'll let you know exactly what I’m doing every step of the way. We can take things at your own pace, and I certainly won't ask you to do anything you're not comfortable with. And yes, please keep your waistcoat on – comfort is key. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in for me…and out…good. Now, if you could just relax your shoulders… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Breathing is slightly shallow, but no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We'll keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. A little elevated, you say? Is that cause for concern? I do tend to get rather…flustered easily, you see. Especially when subjected to medical scrutiny. It’s not terribly dignified, all things considered. And I do enjoy a rather…robust cup of tea, as I’ve previously mentioned. Perhaps that is contributing to the elevation. I do try to remain calm, you see, but it’s not always easy. Especially when subjected to medical scrutiny. And I do have rather…sensitive skin, you see. It tends to react to everything. Especially medical scrutiny. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to confined spaces, you see. Especially medical waiting rooms. So, yes, Doctor, a little elevated, you say? Is that cause for concern? Perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally.
DOCTOR: It's not terribly concerning at the moment, Mr. Vantine. As you said, it could very well be due to a bit of anxiety, and your tea consumption. We'll monitor it. And perhaps we can avoid a prolonged wait time today. Now, let's just check your pulse. Pulse is 80 and regular. Good. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you please open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I have rather…small ears, you see. A family trait, I believe. And I do have rather…sensitive teeth, you see. A consequence of my fondness for biscuits, I suspect. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to bright lights, you see. Especially medical examination lights. And I do have rather…a tendency to gag easily, you see. A rather unfortunate trait, all things considered. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of cotton swabs, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, small ears, sensitive teeth, bright lights, cotton swabs, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the cotton swabs.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. We'll be very gentle. And we'll avoid the cotton swabs altogether, if you prefer. I'll just take a quick look with the light. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is slightly red, but no obvious lesions. Mild swelling of the tonsils. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back for me. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, bowel sounds are normal.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Soft abdomen, no tenderness, normal bowel sounds…that is reassuring, all things considered. Though I must confess, I do have rather…a sensitive digestive system, you see. As I previously mentioned. And I do have rather…a tendency to bloat easily, you see. A consequence of my fondness for biscuits, I suspect. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to being poked and prodded, you see. A rather unfortunate trait, all things considered. And I do have rather…a tendency to tense up when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of anything resembling medical instruments, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when uncomfortable, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, sensitive digestive system, bloating, poking and prodding, medical instruments, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the poking and prodding. And perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. I appreciate your honesty, and your…extensive list of sensitivities. It’s very helpful. We'll proceed very gently, and I’ll certainly avoid anything that makes you uncomfortable. And I'll make a note to suggest a cup of Earl Grey after this. Now, just a few quick neurological checks. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I do have rather…poor eyesight, you see. A consequence of my advanced age, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to blink frequently, you see. A nervous habit, I believe. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to bright lights, you see. Especially examination room lights. And I do have rather…a tendency to get distracted easily, you see. As you may have noticed. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of sudden movements, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, poor eyesight, frequent blinking, bright lights, sudden movements, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the sudden movements. And perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally. Yes…I believe I can follow it…though it’s rather…blurry. And it’s rather…moving quickly. Are you sure it’s not…a trick?
DOCTOR: No trick at all, Mr. Vantine. It's just a simple test. We'll slow it down. Good. Your eye movements seem normal. Now, could you please squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I do have rather…weak hands, you see. A consequence of my profession, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to grip things too tightly, you see. A nervous habit, I believe. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to being touched, you see. A rather unfortunate trait, all things considered. And I do have rather…a tendency to tense up when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of anything resembling medical instruments, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when uncomfortable, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, weak hands, tight grip, being touched, nervous tension, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the gripping. And perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally. Yes…I believe I can squeeze…though it’s rather…uncomfortable. And they’re rather…cold. Are you sure it’s not…a trick?
DOCTOR: No trick at all, Mr. Vantine. My apologies. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. Your grip seems normal. Now, just one final thing. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I do have rather…poor balance, you see. A consequence of my advanced age, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to shuffle when I walk, you see. A nervous habit, I believe. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to enclosed spaces, you see. Especially examination rooms. And I do have rather…a tendency to tense up when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of falling, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when uncomfortable, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, poor balance, shuffling, enclosed spaces, nervous tension, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the walking. And perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally. Yes…I believe I can walk…though it’s rather…precarious. And it’s rather…narrow. Are you sure it’s not…a trick?
DOCTOR: No trick at all, Mr. Vantine. You’re doing very well. Your gait is slightly unsteady, but otherwise normal. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. You are remarkably cooperative, despite your…extensive list of sensitivities. Based on the exam and your history, it appears you're generally in good health for your age. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure and mild red throat suggest we should investigate further. We'll start with some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any underlying infection. I also recommend a flu test, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Perfectly alright. Though I must confess, I do have rather…a fear of needles, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to faint at the sight of blood, you see. A rather unfortunate trait, all things considered. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to enclosed spaces, you see. Especially medical waiting rooms. And I do have rather…a tendency to tense up when nervous, you see. As you may have noticed. And I do have rather…a peculiar fear of anything resembling medical instruments, you see. A rather irrational fear, I suspect. And I do have rather…a tendency to talk incessantly when uncomfortable, you see. As you may have noticed. So, yes, Doctor, needles, fainting, enclosed spaces, nervous tension, incessant talking…please proceed at your own pace. And please be gentle. Especially with the needles. And perhaps a cup of tea would help me to relax. A robust cup of Earl Grey, naturally. Blood work, you say? And a flu test? Very well. Though…would it be terribly uncouth to request a biscuit beforehand? For medicinal purposes, naturally. A digestive biscuit, perhaps? It would certainly…steady my nerves.
DOCTOR: Not uncouth at all, Mr. Vantine. A biscuit for medicinal purposes is an excellent idea. Let me see if we have a digestive biscuit available. Nurse, could we please get Mr. Vantine a digestive biscuit?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. You are most considerate. A digestive biscuit would be…invaluable. And a cup of Earl Grey, if it’s not too much trouble? Just a small cup, naturally. To fortify my resolve. And perhaps a comfortable chair? One without…too many sharp edges? And a calming atmosphere? Preferably one devoid of…needles? And a reassuring presence? Preferably one that understands the…medicinal properties of biscuits? And a detailed explanation of the procedure? Preferably one that avoids…technical jargon? And a gentle touch? Preferably one that doesn’t…startle easily? And a quiet room? Preferably one without…sudden movements? I do apologize for my…extensive list of requests. It’s just that…I do tend to get rather…flustered easily. Especially when subjected to medical scrutiny. And I do have rather…sensitive nerves, you see. And I do have rather…a vivid imagination, you see. And I do have rather…a tendency to overthink things, you see. And I do have rather…a peculiar aversion to surprises, you see. And I do have rather…a fondness for biscuits, you see. And I do have rather…a need for reassurance, you see. And I do have rather…a desire for comfort, you see. And I do have rather…a…well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Mr. Vantine. Your comfort is my priority. We’ll get you a comfortable chair, a small cup of Earl Grey, and a digestive biscuit. And I promise to explain everything in detail, avoiding any jargon. I’ll also be as gentle as possible. The blood work will just involve a small sample of blood taken from your arm. The flu test is a quick nasal swab. We’ll take it slowly, and you can stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. Here you are. A cup of Earl Grey and a digestive biscuit. Please take your time. And when you're ready, we'll proceed at your pace. Would you like me to dim the lights a bit?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. You are most kind. A cup of Earl Grey and a digestive biscuit…a small oasis of calm in a sea of…medical scrutiny. And dimming the lights…an excellent suggestion. It would certainly…soothe my nerves. And a comfortable chair…a refuge from…sudden movements. And a reassuring presence…a beacon of calm. And a detailed explanation…a shield against…unforeseen circumstances. And a gentle touch…a balm against…anxiety. And a slow pace…a sanctuary from…overwhelm. Thank you. A biscuit…a small miracle. And tea…a comforting elixir. And a gentle hand…a reassurance. And a slow pace…a sanctuary. Very good. A digestive biscuit…a small bastion of calm. And Earl Grey…a comforting elixir. Perhaps…perhaps we could start with the explanation? Just a brief overview? To…fortify my resolve? And perhaps a detailed description of the procedure? To…allay my fears? And perhaps a reassurance that it will be…painless? And perhaps a promise that it will be…quick? And perhaps a reminder that it will be…safe? And perhaps a…well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Let's start with the explanation. The blood work involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. We’ll use a very small needle, and the whole process should take only a few minutes. You might feel a slight pinch, but it’s usually very quick. We'll apply a bandage afterward, and there's very little risk of any complications. The flu test is even simpler. We’ll use a small swab to collect a sample from your nose. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it’s over very quickly. It doesn’t hurt, and it doesn’t involve any needles. We’ll take it slowly, and you can stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A small needle…a momentary discomfort. And a small swab…a fleeting sensation. And a momentary discomfort…a tolerable inconvenience. And a fleeting sensation…a negligible discomfort. A small needle…a temporary inconvenience. And a small swab…a negligible discomfort. A momentary discomfort…a tolerable inconvenience. And a fleeting sensation…a negligible discomfort. And the bandage…a reassuring comfort? And the reassurance…a calming presence? And the comfort…a soothing balm? And the presence…a calming beacon? And the…the procedure itself? Just a brief overview? To…fortify my resolve? And a detailed description? To…allay my fears? And a reassurance that it will be…painless? And a promise that it will be…quick? And a reminder that it will be…safe? And perhaps a…well, you understand. And a comfortable chair? And a soothing atmosphere? And a calming presence? And a reassuring touch? And a gentle hand? And a slow pace? And a…well, you understand. And a biscuit? And a cup of tea? And a…well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Let's go through it step-by-step. For the blood work, you'll lie down on the comfortable chair. I'll clean your arm with an alcohol swab, then gently insert the needle into a vein. You might feel a small pinch, but it's very quick. The whole process takes only a few minutes. We'll use a small bandage afterward to stop any bleeding. The flu test is even simpler. We'll just gently insert the swab into your nose for a few seconds. It might feel a little ticklish, but it doesn't hurt. I'll be right here with you the whole time, explaining everything as I go. You can stop me at any time if you're feeling uncomfortable. We’ll take it as slowly as you need. And yes, you have a biscuit and a cup of tea. You are perfectly safe, and I will do everything I can to make you comfortable. Would you like me to show you the needle and the swab?
PATIENT: Show me…the instruments of…potential discomfort? A visual reassurance? A tangible proof of…minimal invasion? A…tactile confirmation of…negligible harm? Show me…the needle and the swab? But…gently? And…slowly? And…with a detailed explanation? And…with a reassuring touch? And…with a promise of minimal discomfort? And…with a reminder of safety? And…with a biscuit? And…with a cup of tea? And…with a comforting presence? And…with a gentle hand? And…with a slow pace? And…with a…well, you understand. Show me…the instruments of…potential discomfort? But…please be gentle? And…slowly? And…with a reassuring explanation? And…with a comforting touch? And…with a promise of minimal harm? And…with a reminder of safety? And…with a biscuit? And…with a cup of tea? And…with a comforting presence? And…with a gentle hand? And…with a slow pace? And…with a…well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Here is the needle. It’s very small, as you can see. It’s only used to draw a small amount of blood for the tests. It’s sterile, which means it’s completely clean and safe. And this is the nasal swab. It’s used to collect a sample from your nose to check for the flu. It’s made of a soft, flexible material, and it won't cause any harm. You can hold them if you'd like, to get a better sense of what they're like. I'll explain everything again before we proceed, and you can stop me at any time. We can take it as slowly as you need. And remember, you have a biscuit and a cup of tea. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable every step of the way. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A…a tiny instrument of…potential discomfort? A…a small implement of…potential invasion? A…a tiny instrument of…potential discomfort? A…a small implement of…potential invasion? A…a tiny instrument of…potential discomfort? A…a small implement of…potential invasion? A…a tiny instrument of…potential discomfort? A…a small implement of…potential invasion? Perhaps…perhaps we could start with the biscuit? A small reassurance? A momentary comfort? A fleeting pleasure? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? Perhaps…perhaps we could start with the biscuit? A small reassurance? A momentary comfort? A fleeting pleasure? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. The biscuit it is. Please, go ahead and enjoy your biscuit. It's a small comfort, and a perfectly acceptable way to start. Take your time, and let me know when you're ready to proceed. There's no rush. And remember, you have a cup of tea. We can talk about the procedure while you're enjoying your biscuit, or we can just sit in silence. Whatever makes you most comfortable. How is the biscuit?
PATIENT: A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? Very good. A digestive biscuit. A small bastion of calm. A comforting elixir. A fleeting pleasure. A…tangible proof of…minimal harm. Perhaps…perhaps we could discuss the procedure? A detailed explanation? A reassuring touch? A…promise of minimal harm? Perhaps…perhaps we could discuss the procedure? A detailed explanation? A reassuring touch? A…promise of minimal harm?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Let’s talk about the procedure. For the blood work, you’ll simply lie down on the comfortable chair. I’ll clean your arm with an alcohol swab to sterilize the area, and then gently insert a very small needle into a vein in your arm. You might feel a slight pinch, like a mosquito bite, but it’s very quick. The whole process takes only a few minutes. We’ll use a small bandage afterwards to stop any bleeding. The nasal swab is even simpler. I’ll gently insert a small, soft swab into your nostril for a few seconds to collect a sample. It might feel a little ticklish, but it won't cause any pain or harm. I’ll be right here with you the whole time, explaining everything as I go. You can stop me at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. We’ll take it as slowly as you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A…a small pinch? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a small pinch? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a small pinch? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? Perhaps…perhaps we could practice the…the procedure? A gentle touch? A reassuring explanation? A…promise of minimal harm? Perhaps…perhaps we could practice the…the procedure? A gentle touch? A reassuring explanation? A…promise of minimal harm? Perhaps…just with the…alcohol swab?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. We can certainly practice with the alcohol swab. That way, you can get a feel for what it will be like. This is the alcohol swab. It’s used to sterilize the skin before we insert the needle. It feels cool and slightly tingly, but it’s completely harmless. Does that feel alright?
PATIENT: A…a cool sensation? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a cool sensation? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a cool sensation? A momentary discomfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? Perhaps…perhaps we could stop there? Just for now? A small reassurance? A momentary comfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. We can absolutely stop there. You’ve done very well. There’s no need to rush. We can take as much time as you need. We've practiced the alcohol swab, and you know what to expect. Would you like to take another bite of your biscuit?
PATIENT: A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? A…a small comfort? A momentary pleasure? A fleeting delight? A…tangible proof of…minimal harm? Very good. A digestive biscuit. A small bastion of calm. A comforting elixir. A fleeting pleasure. A…tangible proof of…minimal harm. Perhaps…perhaps we could discuss the…results? What to expect? A reassuring touch? A…promise of minimal harm? Or…perhaps just a cup of tea?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Let’s talk about the results. The blood work will tell us your cholesterol levels, which are important for heart health. It will also rule out any underlying infection. The flu test will simply tell us if you have the flu or not. If the results are normal, that’s great! We can discuss some healthy lifestyle choices to maintain your good health. If the results are abnormal, we can discuss treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A…a reassuring outcome? A momentary comfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a reassuring outcome? A momentary comfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? A…a reassuring outcome? A momentary comfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? Very good. A digestive biscuit. A small bastion of calm. A comforting elixir. A fleeting pleasure. A…tangible proof of…minimal harm. Perhaps…perhaps we could just…stop there for today? A small reassurance? A momentary comfort? A fleeting sensation? A…negligible harm? I believe…I believe I've had enough excitement for one day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. Absolutely. We can definitely stop there for today. You've done incredibly well, and I'm very proud of you for facing your anxieties. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you have a biscuit and a cup of tea. Take care, Mr. Vantine. .
