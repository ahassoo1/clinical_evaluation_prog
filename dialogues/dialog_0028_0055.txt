DOCTOR: Good morning. Ellan Rannells, yes?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes, that’s me. Though I must say, this office is… quite bustling. Not what I’m accustomed to.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It is a busy clinic. Now, if you could just get straight to the point… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, it’s this… medical marijuana business. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it’s a miracle cure. I’m not one for… fads, but she’s quite insistent. I suppose I’m here to see if it’s… legitimate. And if you think it's appropriate for a woman of my… standing.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana… Right. And you’re considering this for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s in my hands, you see. Quite bothersome, especially with the humidity lately. I’ve tried the usual things, creams and such, but they only offer… temporary relief. My daughter says this marijuana… well, she says it doesn’t feel like anything I’ve tried before. I just want to explore all options, responsibly of course.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your chart indicates some… previous treatment for osteoarthritis, yes. And… limited success with NSAIDs. Now, tell me, where exactly is this arthritis bothering you?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knuckles, Doctor. Both hands, really, but the right one is… decidedly worse. Makes it difficult to do simple things, you understand. Buttoning my gloves, holding a teacup… things a woman should be able to do without… struggling. It’s quite undignified. And sometimes, it aches all the way up to my wrists. Do you need a… a demonstration? I suppose I could… try to open this water bottle.
DOCTOR: No, no demonstration is necessary. Just describe the pain. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache, persistent, you see? And it stiffens up something awful in the mornings. Makes it difficult to even get dressed. Sometimes there’s a throbbing, particularly if I’ve been… using my hands a lot. Though, these days, what is there to use them for? It's just… uncomfortable. And frankly, a bit embarrassing, needing help with the simplest of tasks. A woman should be self-sufficient, don’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… creeping up on me for years, really. Probably a good five years, at least. At first, it was just a little stiffness, easily ignored. But it’s gradually worsened, as these things do. I suppose I didn’t pay much attention to it at first, foolishly thinking it would just… go away on its own. But it hasn't, obviously. It's become a proper nuisance, as I've said. And my daughter keeps mentioning this marijuana… insists I at least explore it. Is it terribly… improper to consider such a thing?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not here to judge your daughter’s… suggestions. But medical marijuana is still… a grey area. We need to rule out other causes first. Have you had any blood tests recently?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, dear. No, not recently. Not for years, I don't believe. I generally avoid doctors unless absolutely necessary, you see. All those needles and… poking. I prefer to handle things myself, if possible. I’ve always been a rather… practical woman. My husband, God rest his soul, always said I was too stubborn for my own good. Perhaps that's why I’ve let this arthritis fester for so long. But I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy otherwise. A little arthritis is hardly a cause for alarm, is it?
DOCTOR: Well, it can be indicative of other issues. We’ll need to run some basic tests to rule out rheumatoid arthritis, just to be safe. And I’d like to examine your hands. Please extend them, palms up.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose I can’t object to a simple examination. Though I do hope it won’t be too… invasive. I trust you wash your hands frequently, Doctor? One can never be too careful with germs these days. And please, be gentle. They’re rather delicate, you see. A woman’s hands are her most precious asset, after all.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some mild swelling in the distal interphalangeal joints. No significant redness or warmth. Range of motion… limited, as expected. And no DeQuervain's tenosynovitis, thankfully. This all seems… typical.
PATIENT: Typical? Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though not particularly helpful, is it? I mean, if it’s simply “typical,” what does that mean? Will this marijuana actually help, or am I wasting my time? My daughter insists it’s a game-changer, but she's always been rather… enthusiastic about alternative remedies. Is there any concrete evidence to support its use, Doctor? I don’t want to be fooled by… hype. I’m a practical woman, remember? And a woman of a certain age deserves a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Look, the evidence is… mixed. There are some studies suggesting it can help with pain management, but they’re not conclusive. And frankly, you're not a candidate for a clinical trial. I'm not going to prescribe you something with limited evidence just because your daughter is enthusiastic. We can try some stronger NSAIDs. A higher dosage, with a proton pump inhibitor to protect your stomach. That’s the most sensible approach.
PATIENT: Stronger NSAIDs? But those barely touched the pain before! And proton pump inhibitors… I don’t like the sound of those. All those side effects… Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like you haven't even considered my request seriously. I came here hoping for an open mind, a willingness to explore all options, and instead I’m being offered… more of the same. This is hardly what I expected. My daughter will be terribly disappointed. And frankly, I’m beginning to think she’s right. You’re simply dismissive of anything that doesn’t fit your… conventional approach. Is there anyone else I can speak to?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. I’ve given you my professional opinion. We can schedule a referral to a rheumatologist if you insist on exploring other options, but I highly doubt they'll recommend medical marijuana. Here’s a prescription for Naproxen, 500mg twice daily, with Omeprazole to protect your stomach. That’s all I can do for you today. Do you want the prescription, or not?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose I have no choice. But don’t expect me to be pleased if it doesn’t work. And I shall be holding you personally responsible if my stomach revolts. My daughter warned me about these… conventional doctors. Always dismissive, always eager to prescribe pills. Honestly, Doctor, I expected more. Much more. .
