DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… it’s been hard to… go to the bathroom, lately. Like, I can go, but it takes a long time, and doesn’t feel like it all comes out. It’s been going on for a few weeks, I think. Maybe a month? Time gets away from me sometimes.
DOCTOR: A month, okay. And you said it takes a long time, and doesn’t feel like a complete emptying?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. Exactly. I have to… push, more than I used to. And then I feel like I still have to go, even after I have gone. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, really, just… frustrating. It worries me some.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, I understand. Okay, so no pain, just incomplete emptying and straining. Have you noticed any changes in your stool itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… what was that word? The… what comes out? No, not really. It looks the same as always, I guess. Maybe a little… harder, sometimes. But I eat a lot of different things, so it changes all the time. I’m not sure if that’s new, or just… how it is. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally the same, but perhaps a little harder at times. And you mentioned you eat a varied diet. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or blood in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, no blood. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. I always look, just to be sure. Everything looks… normal, except for not being able to go all the way. It’s just… it’s a worry. My wife, she always said to tell the doctor if something felt wrong. It’s been a year since she passed, and I try to remember what she would want me to do.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you to be attentive to that, Mr. Hilber. And it's wise to get things checked out. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. And… oh, I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back. But other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, I think. I try to stay active, go for walks when the weather is nice. I take Medicare, is that what you need to know? I don’t go to the doctor much, if I can help it. My wife, she was the one who kept track of all that. I'm sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendix, pneumonia… and Medicare. Do you have a list of medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No, ma’am, I don’t. I don’t really take any medications, unless you count the vitamins. Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. I try to avoid pills if I can. My wife, she always said they just cause more problems than they solve. Sorry, I know I’m rambling. I’m not used to talking about myself like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to help my wife with her gardening, and I was always touching plants and everything. Never a problem. I think I’m pretty lucky, in that way, too. My wife always said I had a strong constitution. She knew everything about me, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard question. My wife’s family, they were mostly healthy. But my… my mother, she had… problems with her heart, I think. And my father, he had some kind of trouble with his stomach. But I don’t know much about it. They lived far away, and we didn’t see them much. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember a lot of details. Sorry. I’m not very helpful, am I? I should have asked my wife to write all this down, when she was still here.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of heart problems and stomach issues. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and then I’d like to do a rectal exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… rectal exam? Well, I… I don't know. Is it necessary? I don’t like doctors poking around in there, if I’m honest. I’m not used to it. I just want to know what’s wrong, and how to fix it. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Hilber. However, a rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating bowel problems. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as masses or tenderness, and assess the tone of your sphincter muscles. It’s important to get a complete picture of what’s going on. We can discuss alternatives if you're absolutely opposed, but it may delay an accurate diagnosis. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if you say it’s important… and if it will help find out what’s wrong… then I guess I can do it. But please, be quick. And… gentle. I’m just… I’m not a fan of doctors, if you understand. My wife, she always handled these things. She was very brave. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie on your side on the examination table with your knees bent. I’ll explain each step as I go. Just relax as much as you can.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m here. This is… not very pleasant. I hope you really know what you’re doing, Doctor. It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded. And please, tell me what you're doing before you do it. I need to know. It helps… a little. My wife always said I was a bit of a worrywart.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. I'm just going to gently insert my finger into your rectum to check for any abnormalities. It might feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. I'm feeling for any masses, tenderness, or abnormalities in the rectal walls. I'm also assessing the tone of your sphincter muscle. Hmm… There is some mild resistance on the left side, and the stool is somewhat impacted. No obvious masses or tenderness, but the tone is a bit diminished. Okay, I’m finished. The exam didn’t reveal anything acutely concerning, but there is some impaction and decreased sphincter tone. This could explain some of your difficulty with complete emptying.
PATIENT: Im-paction? What does that mean? And what about the… tone? Is that bad? Is it serious? I just want to know what’s wrong, Doctor. I don’t like all this medical talk. My wife, she always explained things so clearly. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. Is there something you can do about it?
DOCTOR: Impaction means there’s some hardened stool that’s difficult to pass. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can cause discomfort and difficulty with bowel movements. Decreased sphincter tone means the muscle that controls bowel movements isn’t as strong as it should be, which can also contribute to incomplete emptying. Based on the exam and your symptoms, it’s likely you’re experiencing some degree of constipation and a weakened sphincter muscle. It's not an emergency, but it needs to be addressed. We can start with some lifestyle modifications and over-the-counter remedies. I'm going to order a stool study to rule out any underlying infections or other causes for the constipation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A stool… study? You want to… look at my… you-know-what? That sounds… unpleasant. But if it will help find out what’s wrong, I guess I can do it. But how do I… collect it? And where do I take it? Is there anything special I need to do? My wife, she always took care of all these things. She knew exactly what to do. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, a stool study involves collecting a small sample of your stool. It’s not pleasant, I agree, but it’s a simple test that can help us rule out any underlying causes for your constipation, such as an infection or inflammation. The lab will give you a collection kit with instructions. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample of stool in a clean container, then bring it to the lab as soon as possible. You’ll need to avoid certain foods and medications for a few days before the test, so the results are accurate. I'll have the nurse explain the instructions in detail before you leave. For now, let's focus on some things you can do at home to help relieve your constipation. Increasing your fluid intake, eating a high-fiber diet, and getting regular exercise can all make a big difference. We can also try an over-the-counter stool softener or mild laxative. Would you like me to recommend something?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Recommend something. I’ll try anything to get this sorted out. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s… a lot to take in, but I feel better knowing there’s a plan. And thank you for being patient with me. My wife… she would have asked a lot of questions, but I just get confused easily. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. I recommend starting with a stool softener like docusate sodium, 100-200 milligrams twice a day. If that doesn't provide enough relief, you can try a mild laxative like polyethylene glycol 3350, following the instructions on the package. Make sure to drink plenty of water when taking a laxative. I’m also going to order the stool study and have the nurse provide you with a list of high-fiber foods and tips for managing constipation. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a week, please call the office and schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. I think that’s all. Just… drink more water, take the stool softener, and… eat more fiber. I can do that. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll try to remember everything you said. I appreciate your patience. And please, tell the nurse to explain the instructions slowly. My wife… I miss her explaining things. I just want to go home now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse review everything with you before you leave. Don’t hesitate to ask her any questions. And please, remember to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Get home safely, Mr. Hilber. .
