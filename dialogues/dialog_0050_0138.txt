DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? That's a lovely name. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it's a bit fuzzy, to be honest. My daughter, bless her heart, she scheduled this. Something about… well, I've been having these spells, little weaknesses, mostly on one side. And my sister, God rest her soul, she used to get terrible headaches. It's something about that, I think. It’s all a bit muddled, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to recall specifics, Ms. Tofani. It's quite alright. Let's try to clarify. You mentioned "spells" and "weakness, mostly on one side." Could you elaborate on those spells?
PATIENT: Oh dear, yes. The spells… they don’t last long, thank goodness. It’s like… my arm feels heavy, or my leg just… won’t cooperate. Not all the time, you understand. Just… sometimes when I’m doing things. Like, reaching for something, or walking to the kitchen. It’s hard to explain. It just feels…off. And then it goes away. It's not painful, exactly, just… concerning. My daughter said it’s important to check it out, because of my sister, you see. She worried about the headaches.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness, intermittent, primarily affecting one side of your body. And your daughter rightly brought up your sister’s history of headaches as a potential concern. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me which side is typically affected?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Let me think… It’s… mostly the right side, I believe. Yes, the right arm and leg usually. Though sometimes it feels… a little confusing. It's not always the right side, but more often than not, that’s where I notice it. I’m sorry I’m not more precise, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is quite alright, Ms. Tofani. It’s perfectly understandable. Intermittent weakness, predominantly on the right side, although not exclusively. Now, besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these spells?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes, when it happens, I get a little… confused. Not a lot, just… like I’m searching for the right word, or where I put my glasses. And… now that you mention it… sometimes my head feels a little funny beforehand. Not a full-blown headache, but a sort of… pressure. It's hard to describe. It’s like a dull ache, and then the weakness comes. Does that make sense? I really don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Ms. Tofani. These details are quite helpful. So, we have intermittent right-sided weakness, occasional confusion preceding or during these spells, and a dull pressure in the head beforehand. Now, let’s move on to some broader questions. Have you experienced any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. That’s a good question. You know, I've been needing my glasses more, I think. But that's probably just because I'm getting older. I haven’t noticed anything different, like double vision or blurry spots. Just… needing to hold things a little further away to read them. My daughter keeps telling me to get a new prescription. Is that what you're asking about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. Any changes in your vision, even needing a stronger prescription, can be relevant. Now, have you experienced any difficulty with speech – slurring, trouble finding words, or difficulty understanding what others are saying?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. My daughter sometimes says I repeat myself, but I think that’s just old age! She gets frustrated with me sometimes. No, I can understand people perfectly well, and I don't think I have trouble talking. Sometimes I wander off on a tangent, but that's always been my way. No, I don’t think my speech has changed. It’s good of you to ask, though. It's nice you're asking all these questions.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let's briefly review your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think… Well, the doctor told me years ago I had a little bit of high blood pressure, but he put me on a little pill for it. I take it every day. And… oh, my sister had diabetes, but I don't think I do. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly pasta and a little bit of salad. I've never been told I have anything wrong with my heart. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is helpful, Ms. Tofani. So, a history of hypertension managed with medication. And no known diabetes. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I take a little something for my arthritis, it helps with the aches in my hands. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take one of those… what are they called? A little sleeping pill. Just when I really can’t drift off. Nothing else, I think. Just those two. Oh, and vitamins, of course. A multi-vitamin. Is that too much? My daughter says I take too many pills sometimes.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily too many, but we'll keep track. So, medication for hypertension, arthritis, and occasional use of a sleeping pill, plus a multi-vitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven't had any trouble with medications. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And no, I don't have any food allergies. I eat pretty much anything. Except maybe Brussels sprouts. I never liked those. Does that count? I’m sorry, I’m just trying to be helpful. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. No known current allergies. Now, to complete the history, could you tell me about any major surgeries or hospitalizations you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was a long time ago, though. And… oh, when I was younger, I broke my wrist when I fell off a bicycle. But that was ages and ages ago. No other surgeries that I can remember. I haven't been in the hospital for anything else, thankfully. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful. Cholecystectomy in the past, and a broken wrist. Now, finally, could you briefly tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… Well, my mother lived to be a very old woman, thankfully. She died in her nineties. My father died younger, he had a heart problem, I think. And like I mentioned, my sister, God rest her soul, she used to get terrible migraines. Really awful headaches. It worried me a lot. And… hmm. I don't really know much else about my family history. It wasn't something we talked about a lot. Is that okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is… adequate, Ms. Tofani. Now, I'm going to perform a brief neurological examination to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a neurological examination? Is that… necessary? It sounds a bit frightening, Doctor. I'm not very good with examinations. I get nervous, you see. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose. Just please be gentle. And… don’t take too long, alright? It makes me a little anxious, all these tests.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tofani. It is a standard procedure, and I assure you, it will be quick and painless. It will simply allow me to get a more complete picture of what is going on. First, I'd like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Do not move your head. Can you see my finger clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see your finger clearly, Doctor. Though it’s a bit… wobbly. Are you alright? You seem a little unsteady. It's hard to focus on something that's moving like that. But… yes, I’m following it. It's a little tiring, though, keeping my eyes still. I hope it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Tofani. It appears I was a little rushed. Let’s try to maintain focus, if you please. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me what this is?
PATIENT: Oh dear. What is what? It’s hard to tell with my eyes closed. Is it something cold? Is it metal? It feels… small and… round. Is it a coin? It's hard to guess, Doctor. My fingers aren't very good at feeling things anymore.
DOCTOR: It was a pen cap, Ms. Tofani. Now, let's move on to strength testing. I'd like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. First, your right hand. Squeeze as hard as you can. Do not hesitate.
PATIENT: Oh… is this hard enough, Doctor? I don’t want to hurt you. I don’t have much strength anymore, you see. My arthritis makes my hands ache. It's hard to squeeze things tightly. Is this what you wanted? It feels a little painful, actually.
DOCTOR: That is sufficient, Ms. Tofani. Now, please push against my hands with your legs. We'll start with your right leg. Push against my hands as hard as you can, resisting my pressure. Do not worry, I will not allow you to fall.
PATIENT: Oh dear… this is hard. My legs feel… wobbly. And they ache. I’m trying, Doctor, I really am. It’s just… difficult. Please don’t push too hard, alright? I don't want to fall. It's frightening, you see. It feels like I’m going to lose my balance.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Tofani. That is enough for now. Based on your history and this preliminary examination, it appears you are experiencing some mild weakness on your right side, accompanied by occasional confusion. While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation, given your age and family history, it is prudent to consider several possibilities. However, I do not believe this is an emergency. I recommend a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Additionally, a thorough blood workup will help assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Finally, I suggest a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… a brain MRI? And… blood work? A neurologist? That sounds… frightening, Doctor. Is something seriously wrong? My daughter said something about…strokes? Is that what you're thinking? I don’t understand all these terms… MRI, neurologist… it’s all very confusing. I just came in because I was feeling a little wobbly, and now you’re talking about… serious things. Is it… is it bad? I just want to know. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, please try to remain calm. It is important to remember that I am not diagnosing anything at this time. An MRI and blood work are simply precautionary measures to gather more information. While your symptoms could be indicative of a stroke, it is also possible they are due to a number of other, less serious conditions. It is crucial to rule out all possibilities before drawing any conclusions. A neurologist is a specialist who focuses on the brain and nervous system. They are best equipped to interpret the results of the MRI and determine the appropriate course of action. To be clear, I am recommending these tests to ensure your safety and well-being. It is always better to be thorough and investigate any potential concerns. I will write the orders for the MRI and blood work now, and I will also prepare a referral to a neurologist. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose not. But what is an MRI? Is it… painful? Will it take a long time? And… will I have to lie flat on my back? My back isn't very good, you see. It gets sore easily. And… what if they find something? I don't want to know if something is terribly wrong. I just want to feel better. Is there… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: An MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It is not painful, although you will need to lie very still inside a machine. It typically takes around 30-60 minutes. Yes, you will be lying flat on your back, but the technicians will do their best to make you comfortable. As for what if they find something… we will cross that bridge when we come to it. It is important to focus on gathering the information first. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Stay hydrated, and ensure you are getting adequate nutrition. I also advise you to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. And, perhaps, try to minimize stress. That can exacerbate these symptoms. I will have the nurse provide you with the orders for the MRI and the neurologist referral. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose not. It all sounds… very daunting. And stressful, if you don't mind me saying. I’m just an old woman, Doctor. I don’t understand all this… magnetic fields and neurologists. Alright. I’ll try to rest. And I’ll ask my daughter to schedule everything. She’s very good with these things. And… thank you, I suppose. For trying to help. Is it alright if I just… go now? I feel a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tofani. The nurse will escort you to the exit and provide you with the necessary paperwork. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. I trust you'll follow up promptly with the imaging and referral. Have a… satisfactory day. .
