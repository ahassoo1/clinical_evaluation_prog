DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My… how you say… the place for old people? My husband and I, we want to see if I am okay to go there. For… checking. We need paper for the place.
DOCTOR: Checking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. To make sure I can… live there. They want to know if I am… strong enough? And… not too sick, you know? My husband, he does all the papers. I just come for… the looking at.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this is for potential admission to a long-term care facility. And they require a medical evaluation to assess your suitability. Okay. Let's start with why you think you might need this evaluation, Ms. Abdollahi. What’s been going on that makes you consider a facility?
PATIENT: Oh… well. It is… harder now. To do things. I get tired very fast. And sometimes… I forget things. Small things, mostly. Like… where I put my glasses. Or what I was going to say. My husband, he helps a lot, but… he is getting old too, you know? He worries.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and some memory issues. How long have you been noticing these changes, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… six months? It started slow. I thought it was just… getting old. But it is more now. I… I used to be very good at remembering names. Now… I see a face, and… nothing. It is embarrassing. And I fall sometimes. Not bad falls, but… falls.
DOCTOR: Falls, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe… two times in the last three months? Once in the garden, and once in the kitchen. Nothing broken, just… a little sore. My husband, he got very worried about the kitchen one. He says I need help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: No, not now. My knees… they sometimes ache when it rains, but… that is normal. Old lady knees, you know? Not a bad pain. Just… a little reminder. It is the falling that worries me, and my husband.
DOCTOR: So, primarily fatigue, some memory loss, and a couple of falls. Are you having any difficulty with your vision, hearing, or speaking?
PATIENT: My hearing… not so good. I ask people to speak up sometimes. And… my eyes, they get tired too. I need stronger glasses, I think. But… speaking, no. I can talk just fine. I think. Do you… not understand me? Is my English bad?
DOCTOR: No, no, your English is perfectly fine, Ms. Abdollahi. It's just routine questions. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… a long time ago, he said my pressure was a little high. He gave me a… a little white pill. I take it every morning. And… I had a problem with my heart, many years ago. They… they fixed it with… with surgery. A long time ago. Everything is okay now, the doctor said. I think.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous heart surgery. Do you remember what kind of heart surgery it was, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Oh… that was so long ago. I… I think they fixed a valve? Something with the… the pumping. My husband, he remembers more. He always asks the doctor all the questions. I just… I just lay there. I was very sick.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your records here… Ah, yes. Valve replacement, 20 years ago. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Yes. I take one for my… for my bones. The doctor said they were getting weak. And… sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take something for the pain. But not every day. Only when I need to. My husband, he gives me the right pills. I get confused. So many pills!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your balance. Then, perhaps we can discuss some basic cognitive tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to make sure I am okay. And… to make my husband happy. He worries so much.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale… Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but a slight murmur is present, consistent with previous valve replacement. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure… 140/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay. Everything is fine, yes? My husband says I worry too much. He says old ladies are always worrying.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common at your age. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Okay. Careful… old bones, you know? My husband says I wobble.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a slight instability. Let's have you walk a few steps forward, and then back. Just nice and slow.
PATIENT: Okay. It is hard… I feel like I will fall. My husband, he says I need a walker. I don't want a walker. It is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good that we're assessing this now. Based on this brief exam, it appears you do have some balance issues and some weakness, along with the memory concerns you mentioned. We should order some further testing to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. And I think a neurological consult would be beneficial to evaluate your cognitive function and balance more thoroughly.
PATIENT: Okay. More tests? My husband will be happy. He likes… knowing things. What do these tests… do? Will they hurt?
DOCTOR: No, the tests won't hurt, Ms. Abdollahi. The blood tests are just a simple draw – a small needle prick. They’ll help us check your overall health and see if there are any underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. The neurological consult will involve a more in-depth assessment of your memory, thinking skills, and balance. They may ask you some questions, and perform some simple physical tests. It's just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It’s important to rule out any treatable causes for your symptoms. I'm going to write up these orders now. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed. And, I strongly advise against driving until we have a better understanding of your condition.
PATIENT: Okay. No driving. My husband will be very happy about that. He always says I drive too slow. He will take me everywhere. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. Can… can my husband come to the next appointment? He likes to… hear everything from the doctor himself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. Your husband is more than welcome to attend the next appointment. In fact, I encourage it. It's always helpful to have a second pair of ears. Here are the lab orders. You'll need to take these to the lab down the hall. And I’ll have my nurse schedule you for a neurological consult. We'll discuss the results of these tests at your follow-up appointment, and develop a plan of care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I will go to the lab now. I hope my husband is not too worried. He worries about everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I understand your husband's concerns. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day. .
