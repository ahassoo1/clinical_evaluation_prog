DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reynold. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's my cough. Been… bad lately. And there's blood in it. Not a lot, but… yeah. Blood when I cough. It's kinda scary. I smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood in your cough is definitely something we need to investigate. And yes, smoking is very relevant. How long has the cough been going on, and when did you first notice the blood?
PATIENT: Long… a while. Years, I guess. But the blood? Not long. Maybe a couple weeks? Hard to say exactly. I don't really… keep track of things like that. It just started showing up, and I figured I should probably get it checked. I don’t remember when exactly. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, but don’t worry about being precise. A couple of weeks is helpful. Has the amount of blood been increasing, staying the same, or decreasing over those couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Hmm. I think… staying the same, maybe? It's not like a lot, just… streaks in the stuff I cough up. Not a whole lot more, not a whole lot less. Just… there. I really don't know. Does it matter if it's bright red or… darker? I don't pay attention to that stuff.
DOCTOR: It does matter, yes. Bright red usually means it’s more recent, darker can mean it’s been there longer. But even streaks are concerning. Okay. And besides the blood, any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other stuff? Let me think… I get tired easier. Been… winded, even walking to the store. And my chest feels kinda… tight sometimes. Not all the time, but yeah. I guess that's it. I don’t really have much energy these days. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and shortness of breath are things we need to consider. Chest tightness too. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me.
PATIENT: Okay. There. Like that? It feels kinda… weird. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is normal. Your lungs sound… a little congested, I’m hearing some wheezing. Do you have any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma… COPD? I don’t think so. Never been told that. I worked… around a lot of dust when I was younger. Construction, stuff like that. But I don’t know about those things. Never been sick much, really. Just this cough now. I don’t understand all those fancy names. Is that dust important?
DOCTOR: Okay, construction work and dust exposure is important. That could be a factor. We’re going to need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at what’s going on in your lungs. And I’d also like to order some blood work to check for infection and other things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… blood work? I guess so. If you think it’s necessary. I don't like going to the hospital or anything. But… if it’ll find out what’s wrong… yeah. Okay. When do I have to go? I gotta get back to work, you know. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can schedule the X-ray and blood work here at the clinic, you won't have to go to the hospital. The clinic has a lab on-site and we have a mobile X-ray unit coming in tomorrow morning at 10 AM. We can do both then. I’ll have my nurse schedule that for you. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I take a daily vitamin, but that’s it. I don't really take pills unless I have to. Is that okay? I just… don’t remember allergies. I don’t think I have any. Can we hurry this up a little? I’m kinda busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, good. Just a daily vitamin. Alright, Nurse will get you scheduled. I'm going to write you a temporary prescription for an inhaler to help with the wheezing while we wait for the test results. It might provide some relief. It’s a bronchodilator. Should help open up your airways. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Bronco… what? As long as it helps me breathe easier. Okay. No, I don't think so. Just… when will I get the results? And can I still work? I really need to know. I don't want to lose my job over this cough. That's all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you helping me. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Okay, the results should be back in a couple of days, and we’ll call you with them. As for work, I'd advise against heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we know what’s going on. You can still do lighter tasks, but avoid anything that makes you short of breath. Here’s the prescription for the inhaler. Nurse will give you instructions on how to use it. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. I just wanna feel better. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
