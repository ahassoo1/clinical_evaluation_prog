DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mr. Schlatterer! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s… complicated. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. Workplace… issues. Burnout, I believe is the term. Though I find the modern vocabulary rather… imprecise. I was told I should come. My performance reviews haven't been stellar, apparently. It’s all very… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling quite stressed and maybe a bit overwhelmed with things at work. And you’re right, sometimes it’s hard to put these feelings into words. We'll try to figure things out. When you say "workplace issues" and "burnout," could you tell me a little more specifically what's been going on?
PATIENT: Specifically? Really? Must we delve into details? It’s… the students, mostly. They lack… discipline. Respect. And the administration… well, they encourage this laxity, this… coddling. It's simply not how things were done in my day. I’ve been a Library Science Teacher for… a very long time, you understand. And things have… deteriorated. Is that specific enough? I'd rather not bore you with the minutiae.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d prefer not to get into too much detail, and that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you’re feeling very frustrated with changes in the work environment and the students’ behavior, and maybe a bit unsupported by the administration. That's a lot to deal with after being in the profession for a long time. So, this frustration… how long has it been building?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Years, probably. It's not a sudden thing, you see. A gradual… erosion. Honestly, I struggle to recall exact dates. Everything blurs together after a certain point. Perhaps five years? Maybe more? It began subtly, with… less emphasis on proper research techniques. Then the dress code became… lenient. And then the constant questioning of established methods. It's a long story, and frankly, a rather tedious one. I'm not entirely sure why I'm recounting this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this has been going on for at least five years, a gradual shift in the work environment that's been causing you increasing stress. It's understandable that it would feel tedious to go over, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. And how has this stress been affecting you personally?
PATIENT: Affecting me? Well, I find myself… less tolerant. More irritable, I suppose. My wife… ex-wife, rather… used to comment on it. Said I was “difficult.” Naturally, she was… overly sensitive. I sleep… adequately. Though not as soundly as I once did. And I haven’t much appetite these days. Though that could simply be the quality of the cafeteria food. It's dreadful, truly. I've lost some weight, I believe, though I haven't bothered to check. It’s all rather… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve noticed increased irritability, some changes in your sleep, and a decreased appetite, along with some weight loss. It sounds like this stress is definitely taking a toll on you physically and emotionally. Do you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or anxious outside of work, or is it mostly confined to the workplace?
PATIENT: Outside of work? Hmm. I suppose… a little. I find I don’t enjoy my hobbies as much anymore. Used to be a very avid chess player. Now… it feels like a chore. And I avoid social gatherings. Too much… noise. And pointless chatter. My book collection is my solace, really. Though even that feels less… rewarding lately. It's difficult to explain. Everything is just… muted. Perhaps it’s my age. Everything loses its vibrancy eventually. I really haven't the energy for a lengthy analysis of my personal life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like this feeling of being “muted” and less enjoyment in things is extending beyond the workplace into your personal life as well. And it’s understandable that you wouldn’t want to spend time on a lengthy analysis – we can take things at your pace. Have you ever felt this way before, perhaps during other stressful periods in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a long time ago. When I was starting out, teaching. The bureaucracy was… intense, even then. Different problems, naturally. More about… proving my worth. Establishing myself. But there was a similar… weight. A similar lack of enthusiasm. It passed, eventually. With time. And… a change in administration. I’m not sure this will pass. Things are so… different now. Everything is so… soft. Frankly, I doubt a new administrator would make much difference. It’s a systemic problem, I suspect. A rather depressing thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've experienced similar feelings of stress and lack of enthusiasm earlier in your career, but you feel this situation is different and more pervasive. Now, let's talk a little about your physical health. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re being treated for, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Good heavens, are we now delving into my medical history? Really? I suppose. I have… had some issues with my blood pressure. It fluctuates. Doctor keeps telling me to watch my salt intake. Which is rather pointless, as everything tastes bland without it. And my arthritis, of course. It’s a constant… companion. Mostly in my hands. Makes it difficult to… grade papers sometimes. But other than that, I’m… reasonably healthy for my age. Though I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. I dislike hospitals. They’re… depressing places.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been managing some fluctuations in your blood pressure and arthritis, mostly in your hands. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly. Do you take any medications currently, for your blood pressure, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, a small pill for the blood pressure. Once a day. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes, when the arthritis is particularly bad, I take ibuprofen. Over the counter, of course. I prefer to avoid… stronger medication whenever possible. All those side effects. I read about them. Dreadful things. Honestly, I find a hot compress is usually sufficient for the arthritis. Though it's becoming less effective lately. I really shouldn’t be bothering you with all of this. It's rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take Lisinopril once a day for your blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, thank you for sharing all of that with me. Let me just review some information from your EHR… height is 176 centimeters, weight is 117 kilograms… that puts your BMI at 37.6, which is considered obese. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Obese?! Good heavens! That's… rather insensitive. I am… stocky. Solidly built. And no, I have no allergies. Absolutely none. I've eaten everything, and I mean everything, throughout my long life. I refuse to believe such nonsense about allergies. It's all modern hysteria, if you ask me. Frankly, I'm finding this consultation… increasingly unpleasant. I've wasted enough of my time already. Is there anything useful we can do, or are we simply going to discuss my weight?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Schlatterer. That was not my intention to cause offense. I simply wanted to get a complete picture of your health. I understand your concerns and frustration. Let's focus on what's bringing you in today – the stress at work, feeling overwhelmed, and the loss of enjoyment in your hobbies. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of burnout and potentially some mild depression. To be clear, I'm not giving you a definitive diagnosis right now. But I would like to run a few basic blood tests to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Oh, very well. If you insist. But I expect it won't reveal anything. It's simply… stress. Lack of appreciation. A generation lacking discipline. Blood tests won’t solve that. But… fine. Get it over with. Just… please be quick about it. I have a very important book to re-shelve when I return to the library. It's a first edition, you understand. It requires careful handling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand. We’ll be as quick as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw some blood. It's a standard panel – just to check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and some basic blood counts. While we’re waiting, I want to talk about some things we can do to help manage the stress. Are you currently doing anything to relax or de-stress?
PATIENT: Relax? De-stress? Good heavens, no. I find such activities… frivolous. I read. That’s my relaxation. Though, as I mentioned, even that is becoming less enjoyable. I used to take long walks, but the neighborhood has… deteriorated. Too much noise. Too many… people. Honestly, I prefer the quiet solitude of the library. Though, admittedly, even that is becoming less peaceful with… everything. I really don't have time for such… nonsense. What did you expect me to say? I'm a librarian, not a… wellness guru.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like finding relaxing activities has become difficult. Perhaps we can explore some options that might be more suitable for you, even if it's just small changes. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that might help, along with the blood tests. I noticed your weight… and while I apologize for phrasing it insensitively earlier, maintaining a healthier weight can have a significant impact on your overall health and energy levels. We don't need to make drastic changes, but even small steps can be beneficial. Would you be open to discussing that?
PATIENT: Now you're back to my weight? Honestly! This is… outrageous. I am perfectly healthy for my age, thank you very much. A little… stocky, perhaps. But healthy. I do not need a lecture on… lifestyle modifications from a doctor. I’ve lived a long and productive life. I’ve curated a vast collection of literature. I’ve dedicated myself to preserving knowledge. My weight is hardly relevant. I find this consultation… increasingly offensive. Just… please hurry up with the blood tests. I want to be finished with this as soon as possible. I have books to re-shelve. And frankly, I’m beginning to suspect you’re judging my life choices. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I sincerely apologize if I’ve offended you. That was not my intention at all. I was simply trying to provide comprehensive care, and I clearly haven’t communicated effectively. I respect your life choices and I value your dedication to preserving knowledge. I will stop discussing your weight and lifestyle. Let’s focus on what you want to get out of this consultation. We can talk about strategies for managing stress at work, if you'd like. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood. Then we can discuss some options for moving forward, if you’re willing. .
