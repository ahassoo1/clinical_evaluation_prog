DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's get this over with. It's about this… procedure. The one my daughter scheduled for me. Face lift, or something. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but she insists. They need a doctor to say I'm… fit enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A facelift, yes. I see that on the schedule. And your daughter felt a medical clearance was prudent. While I understand your… directness, Mr. Orwin, a proper assessment is necessary. It’s not simply about whether you want the procedure, but whether you're a suitable candidate from a medical standpoint. Let's start with your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Fine, fine. Look, I’m 81 years old, of course I’ve got a few things. Let me think… My blood pressure’s been a little high sometimes, but I don’t take anything for it. The doctor said to watch my salt intake, which I mostly do. And I had a bit of a cough last winter, but that cleared up. Nothing serious. Used to be strong as an ox, building terrazzo floors, you know. Now… well, now I mostly sit. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: “A little high” is rather vague, Mr. Orwin. Do you know what your blood pressure readings typically are?
PATIENT: Readings? Honestly, no. My daughter takes care of all that paperwork. She's a worrier, that one. Always has been. I just… feel fine. I get a bit tired in the afternoons, but who doesn’t at my age? I've lived a full life, you know. Not much point dwelling on numbers, is there? Look, can we just get this over with? I have a perfectly good afternoon nap planned.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, “feeling fine” isn’t a substitute for objective data. A facelift is a surgical procedure, and even a relatively minor one carries risks. I need to determine if those risks are acceptable for you, specifically. Let’s try a different approach. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Goodness. Let me see... When I was a young man, I broke my arm falling off a roof while working. Terrazzo work, dangerous business. Had a cast on for six weeks. And… oh, yes. When my wife, bless her soul, she passed, I was in the hospital for a few days. Just… to recover. That was… a long time ago. Apart from that, no. I've always been a healthy man, despite what the daughter says. Are we getting anywhere with this? I really would like to go home now.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, besides the arm?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Now that you mention it, I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… oh, yes. I had a mole removed from my back a few years ago. Small thing, the doctor said it was just a precaution. Other than that… no. I’ve avoided hospitals and doctors as much as humanly possible. They never have anything good to say. Honestly, I'm starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, even occasionally?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't take anything. Never have. I believe in keeping my body natural, you see. All these pills and potions… just messes with your system. My daughter keeps offering me things for my arthritis, but I refuse. I'll just rub some liniment on it. That's what my father used to do. Is this getting us closer to the end? I'm starting to feel quite weak, actually. Being questioned like this is very draining.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your… reluctance, but I need a complete picture of your health. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Used to be a hearty appetite, I tell you. Still is, actually. Though not as much as I used to. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Maybe a bit of a sniffle now and then, but that's just the weather. Honestly, Dr. Duplichan, I'm a very simple man. I eat, I sleep, I work – or used to work. This whole process is… frankly, ridiculous. Can we just sign something and be done with it? My nap is going to be ruined at this rate.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination. It won’t be extensive, but I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just get a general sense of your overall condition. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need you to remove your shirt, and I'll provide a gown.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Must I? It's undignified, you know. I’m 81 years old! But… alright, alright. Don't tell me I didn't try to avoid this. Honestly, all this fuss for a little face lift… It's the daughter, I tell you. She's the one who insists. Get it over with quickly, please. I'm not a fan of doctors and their… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 150/90. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pulse is 78 and regular. I also note some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you experience any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Not really. Sometimes when I climb the stairs, I get a little… winded. But that's just because I'm old, isn't it? And chest pain… no. Never had any chest pain. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes I get a little… discomfort in my chest after a heavy meal. But that's just indigestion, I reckon. Too much rich food, you see. I used to enjoy a good steak, but I have to watch my diet now. This is all very unsettling, you know. Are these normal things for a man my age? I'm starting to worry now, thanks to all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: The murmur requires further investigation, Mr. Orwin. And the ankle swelling, combined with your blood pressure and occasional chest discomfort, suggests potential cardiac issues. I am hesitant to clear you for a facelift at this time. It would be irresponsible of me to proceed without a thorough cardiac evaluation. I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist and an EKG to assess your heart function. We need to rule out any underlying heart condition before considering elective surgery. It's a matter of your safety, sir.
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Now you're telling me I have heart problems?! This is ridiculous! I feel perfectly fine! It’s just old age, I tell you! My daughter will have a field day with this. She always said I should have gone to the doctor more often. This is all her fault! I knew I shouldn't have agreed to this…this whole charade. Look, can’t you just sign something saying I’m fit enough? I’m sure it’ll be alright. I've lived a long life, haven't I? I'm not afraid of a little surgery. But a cardiologist…that sounds serious. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign off on a surgical procedure without a reasonable assessment of your cardiac risk. To do so would be a disservice to you and potentially put your life in danger. I strongly recommend a cardiology consultation. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable specialist. I won't proceed with a clearance until we have those results. I'm sorry, but my priority is your well-being. .
