DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, a friend suggested I look into this… PrEP thing. She said it’s a good idea to be careful, you know? I’m not really sure what it is exactly, but she seemed to think I should talk to someone about it. I’m Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: Good to meet you, Helaina. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication taken to prevent HIV. Your friend is right to be cautious, and it's smart of you to come in and learn more. To get a better understanding of whether PrEP is right for you, I’m going to ask a few questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Fire away. I don’t mind answering questions, as long as it won’t take too long. I have a few things I need to get back to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’m… mostly okay. I have a little arthritis in my knees, which is what you’d expect at my age, I guess. And the doctor told me my cholesterol is a bit high, so I’m supposed to be watching what I eat. Other than that… nothing major. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups. I haven’t been sick in a long time, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and elevated cholesterol. And you said you’re on Medicare, so regular check-ups. That’s good. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been diagnosed with any of those things. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. I worry about the arthritis getting worse, but that's about it. Is this about… risky behavior? My friend didn't really explain it, just said everyone should be on this PrEP. I'm a single woman, if that matters. Been single for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. PrEP is generally considered for people who are at risk of HIV exposure. And yes, sexual activity is one way to be exposed. It’s not just about “risky” behavior, though. To clarify, have you had any recent sexual partners?
PATIENT: Recent… hmm. That’s a good question. It’s been… a while. A couple of years, I think? Maybe three? I dated a man briefly, but it didn’t go anywhere. Before that… not for a long time. I mostly keep to myself these days. Does it matter if it was a long time ago? I’m not exactly a wild woman, if that’s what you’re getting at. I just want to be safe, that’s all. This is… personal.
DOCTOR: It does matter, but it’s all relevant information, and I understand it's personal. We need to assess your risk factors to determine if PrEP is appropriate. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I think… maybe twice? Once a long time ago, when I was still married, just as a precaution. And then again a few years back, when I started dating. Both times came back negative. I can tell you the dates if that helps? I remember exactly when I went to the doctor for each one. I have a pretty good memory.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Having those dates would be helpful, actually. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not that I know of. I took some antibiotics a few years ago for a sinus infection, and I didn’t have any reaction to those. And I take a little something for my arthritis, but I haven’t had any problems with that either. I’m usually pretty good with medications. I always read the labels, just to be careful. Let me see...the antibiotics were in… 2022, I think. And the arthritis medication… oh, it’s naproxen. 500mg, twice a day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, Naproxen 500mg twice daily. Just one last thing before we move on. Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don't think so. Just the naproxen for my knees. Sometimes I take a little something for indigestion, Tums, but that’s only when I eat something spicy. I don't really like taking a lot of pills, so I try to avoid it when I can. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a little silly answering all these questions. Are we getting anywhere with this PrEP thing? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Ms. Trefren. It's important to get a complete picture. And yes, we are getting somewhere. Based on what you've told me so far, you don't have any immediate contraindications for PrEP. Now, PrEP is a daily pill, and it’s very effective at preventing HIV when taken consistently. However, it's not 100% foolproof. To make the best decision, we'll need to do a quick blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any other potential issues. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Okay, a blood test… I guess that makes sense. I do have good veins, if that helps! I always get stuck easily. As long as it doesn't take too long, and I can get back to my afternoon. It’s just… I’m not really a fan of needles, but if it’s necessary… yes, okay, let’s do the blood test.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse draw a few vials. It will only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, I’ll explain a little more about the potential side effects of PrEP and what to expect. It’s important you feel comfortable and informed. Also, just to confirm, do you have any concerns about adhering to a daily medication regimen?
PATIENT: Oh, adhering… that means taking it every day, right? I think I’d be okay with that. I’m pretty good at routines, actually. I get up at the same time every morning, I have my coffee, I take my naproxen… I could probably add a little pill to the mix. But… what are the side effects? That’s what I’m really worried about. I don't want to feel sick all the time. I’ve heard some pills can really mess you up. Is this something I have to keep taking forever if I start it?
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions. The most common side effects are mild – things like nausea, fatigue, or headache, but they usually go away within a few weeks. Serious side effects are rare. We’ll monitor your kidney function regularly to make sure everything is okay. As for how long you need to take it… that depends. If you remain at risk of HIV exposure, it’s something you’d continue. If your risk changes – for example, if you were to stop having sexual partners – we could re-evaluate. It's not a lifetime commitment, but consistent use is vital for effectiveness. The nurse is ready for you now. We’ll get the blood drawn, and then we can discuss the results and whether PrEP is the right choice for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. I appreciate you explaining it all. Yes, let’s get the blood drawn. The sooner I know, the sooner I can stop worrying about this. I just want to be safe, you know? Lead the way. And please, tell the nurse I’m a bit of a faint-er. Not a big fainter, but I do get lightheaded easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Trefren. We'll take good care of you. The nurse is aware and will be extra gentle. Right this way. She's just through here. We’ll be right back to discuss everything once the results come in.
