DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… the lady on the phone said… something about learning? I forget. My husband, he told me to come. Just… learning stuff. Is that right? I work with metal all day, so my brain is… busy.
DOCTOR: Learning… right. Well, typically when someone comes in for “learning,” it's because they're not feeling well. Is there anything specific that's bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Not really. I mean, my back aches. Always does. Metal is heavy, you know? But… I just push through it. My husband says I need to… be careful. He worries too much. Is this what the learning is about? How not to… break?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, your back aches, and your husband is concerned. It's good he's looking out for you. "Learning" wasn't exactly the term used on the scheduling notes, but we can certainly address the back pain. How long has it been aching?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. Since… before my daughter was born? Maybe. It’s just… work. You lift things, you bend, you cut… it hurts. I take… pills sometimes. The red ones. But they don’t really do much. I don’t… remember what they’re for, exactly. My husband gives them to me.
DOCTOR: Right. Years of back pain… and you take red pills your husband gives you. Do you know the dosage, or what they’re supposed to be for?
PATIENT: Dosage? No. He just… says “take two”. And they’re for the pain, I guess? I don't ask too many questions. He knows best. They don't help help, but… they stop me from complaining, maybe? I don’t know. It’s just… metal work is hard. Not everyone understands.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's… concerning that you're taking medication you don't know anything about. We really need to figure out what those pills are. And “stopping you from complaining” isn’t a good reason to be on anything. Alright, let's try to get a better picture of this pain. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: It hurts… everywhere. But mostly… down here. <points vaguely at lower back> And sometimes it goes down my leg. It feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing it. And when I bend over, it gets worse. Really worse. It’s just… part of the job, I thought. Everyone at work feels it, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see. <presses on the lower back> Does this hurt?
PATIENT: <winces slightly> Ouch! Yes. Right there. That's… that's the spot. It always hurts when someone touches it. You're… strong. Not that's a bad thing, but… ouch. Careful, please. It’s like… a knot. A really bad knot.
DOCTOR: Okay. There is some tenderness there, definitely. And I see you’re leaning a bit to the side. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Tingling… sometimes. In my foot. The left one. Mostly when I’ve been working all day. It feels… like pins and needles. Not all the time, though. Just… after. When I sit down to rest, it goes away. My husband says it's just my circulation. He reads a lot of things online. He’s very smart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have you try to bend forward and touch your toes. Slowly, now. And then stand up straight. <observes the patient’s movement, noting any limitations or discomfort> How does that feel?
PATIENT: <struggles to bend forward, wincing and stopping halfway> Ouch! I can't… I can't really get down that far. It pulls. It pulls really bad. And when I stand up… it’s even worse. It feels like something is… stuck. <stands up slowly, grimacing> See? Not good. I told you. Metal work is hard on the body. You wouldn't understand unless you… do it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I don't do metal work, but I do understand how pain can affect your body. It sounds like you may have a muscle strain, or possibly something more going on with your spine. We need to get some imaging done to rule out anything serious. And we absolutely need to figure out what those red pills are. I'm going to order an X-ray of your lower back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… safe? My mother, she always worried about those things. Radiation, she said. But… I guess if you say it’s okay. And the pills… my husband won’t be happy if I tell him you want to know about them. He gets… protective. But… I guess I should. It’s just… a lot of trouble. Will it take long? I have work tomorrow. Metal doesn't cut itself, you know.
DOCTOR: The X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of ruling out a serious issue far outweigh the risks. It’ll only take a few minutes. As for the pills, I understand your husband may not be happy, but it’s important for your health. I can document that you expressed concern about his reaction. We need to know what you're taking before we can do anything else. It's not about getting him in trouble, it’s about keeping you safe. As for work… we’ll see what the X-ray shows. Depending on the results, you may need to take some time off. Now, let’s get you over to radiology. Do you have anything metal on you—jewelry, piercings—that we need to remove?
PATIENT: <fidgets with her hands> Metal? Oh… well, I have earrings. Small ones. And… a necklace. But it's just… gold. Is gold okay? And… I wear my work boots, of course. They have… metal in them. A lot of metal. But I need those for work! I don’t understand. Why can't I just take the pills and keep working? My husband… he always says I’m strong enough. He's a good man. I just… want to get this over with. This is too much trouble. Is there… another way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, we need to remove all metal objects before the X-ray, as they can interfere with the image and give us inaccurate results. Gold is metal. Boots are metal. It's a standard procedure. I understand you’re worried about your work, and that your husband thinks you’re strong, but ignoring a potential problem isn’t strength, it’s dangerous. We’ll give you a secure place to store your belongings while you get the X-ray. <pauses, looks at the patient directly> Do you want to figure out what’s causing your pain, or not?
PATIENT: <looks down at her hands, then back up with a slightly defiant expression> I… I just want it to stop hurting. I want to be able to work. I don’t want trouble with my husband. But… I guess if I have to take the earrings and… the boots off… fine. But I’m telling you, it’s going to be a lot of trouble. And he’s not going to be happy. Not happy at all. <pauses, looking around nervously> Can we do it quickly? I have things to do. And… where will I put the boots? They're very heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Radiology is just down the hall. We have a secure locker room where you can leave your belongings. I’ll write you a note explaining the situation to the technician. It shouldn’t take long. And yes, we'll make it as quick as possible. <hands the patient a slip of paper> Here's the locker number and the technician's name. After the X-ray, they’ll send the images to me. We’ll go over the results when you get back. In the meantime, if you’re experiencing any severe pain—like numbness, weakness, or loss of bowel control—go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: <takes the paper with a sigh> Emergency room? Oh… that sounds bad. I don't want to go to the emergency room. I just want to know what's wrong with my back. Bowel control? That’s… not a nice thing to talk about. Fine. I understand. Locker number… technician’s name. <fidgets with the paper> I guess I’ll go. But this is a lot of trouble. <starts to walk slowly towards the hallway, looking back nervously> I hope he doesn’t yell at me. <mumbles to herself> All this trouble over a little back pain…
