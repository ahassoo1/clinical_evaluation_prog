DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this cough. It won’t go away, and I’m always tired. And my sinuses… they get infected a lot. It’s just wearing me down, you know? I’d like to get it figured out if we can.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent cough, fatigue, and frequent sinus infections—that certainly sounds frustrating, Mr. Pithan. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… productive, I guess that’s what they call it. Lots of… stuff coming up. Mostly in the mornings, but it happens throughout the day too, especially if I… well, if I’m moving around a lot. It’s been going on for… oh, gosh, I don't know, maybe three, four months now? It comes and goes, but it always comes back. It's never really gone gone, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Pithan. A cough that comes and goes, but never fully resolves, can be particularly concerning. And you mentioned it's worse with activity?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. If I’m doing anything physical – chopping wood, helping with the garden, even just walking up a hill – it gets worse. Starts me hacking, you know? And then it lingers for a while afterwards. It's… it's a bother. And it makes me really winded. I used to be able to do a lot more.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s productive, worse with activity, and leads to shortness of breath. I’m noting that. Now, regarding the sinus infections – how often would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Seems like every other month, maybe? I get a real bad headache, stuffy nose, the whole nine yards. Doctor says it's sinus infection, gives me some pills, and it clears up… for a bit. Then it comes back. It's… regular. Used to just be in the winter, but now it feels like all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent sinus infections, occurring almost monthly now, and seemingly year-round. I'm writing that down. Do you recall what your doctor has prescribed for these sinus infections in the past?
PATIENT: Uhhh… honestly, no. Pills. White ones, mostly, I think. Sometimes yellow. I just take 'em like they tell me. I don't really pay attention to the names. I just wanna feel better. I don’t remember the doctor ever saying anything about needing to take them long term, though. Just a few days each time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Pithan, it's perfectly common not to remember medication names. We can look that up in your records if needed. Let’s move on to some other general questions. Do you have any past medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I had the flu pretty bad a couple of times, but that's about it. I go to the tribal health clinic for checkups sometimes, but they usually just check my blood pressure and tell me to eat less salt. Nothing major ever wrong, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy, or used to be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. I've broken a bone or two when I was a kid, but they just set it and put a cast on. Nothing serious. I try to avoid doctors if I can.
DOCTOR: I understand that sentiment, Mr. Pithan. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Uhhh… my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was pretty young. And my older brother… he had some trouble breathing later in life. But other than that, not really. Lots of strong people in my family, mostly. We were outside people, you know? Ranching, farming… good, hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your mother and breathing difficulties in your brother – I’ll make a note of that. And what about your social history, Mr. Pithan?
PATIENT: What do you mean by that? Like… do I have friends? I live alone now, mostly keep to myself. I don't really go out much. Used to… but not anymore. I don't drink, don't smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Pithan. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. And like I said, never taken much in the way of medicine, so… haven't had a chance to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take some ibuprofen for my knees. They get stiff, you know? Especially in the cold weather. That’s about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. Thank you. Now, Mr. Pithan, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and take a look at your sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with. I don't like being sick, and I'd like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pithan, take a few deep breaths for me… and exhale slowly. I'm hearing some wheezing in your lower lungs, bilaterally. That means there’s some narrowing of the airways. Your breathing sounds a little labored as well. Your heart rate is regular, but a little elevated. I don’t hear any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your sinuses are quite tender to the touch, especially around your forehead and cheekbones. There's also some mild redness in those areas. Okay, Mr. Pithan. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam findings – the wheezing, labored breathing, tender sinuses, and history of frequent infections – it sounds like you could have a combination of chronic bronchitis and recurrent sinusitis. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this and rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to get a chest X-ray and a blood test?
PATIENT: Chronic… what-itis? Look, I don't really understand all that doctor talk. Is it serious? I just want to be able to breathe again. And yes, do whatever tests you think are necessary. Just… get me fixed, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Pithan, and I'll do my best to explain things clearly. Chronic bronchitis means there’s long-term inflammation of the airways in your lungs, which causes the wheezing and coughing we heard today. It’s not necessarily immediately serious, but if left untreated, it can worsen over time and lead to more breathing difficulties. The recurrent sinusitis explains the frequent sinus infections and tenderness. We want to determine the cause of the infections and get them under control. The chest X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs to rule out other conditions like pneumonia or other lung problems. The blood test will help us check for infection and inflammation, and also rule out other underlying causes. Would it be alright if I ordered those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yeah, order 'em. Whatever you think is best. I’ve got things to do, you know? Don’t want to be stuck here all day. Where do I go to get 'em done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pithan. I understand. I've just put in the orders for a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. You can have those done at the imaging center just across the parking lot – I’ll have the receptionist give you a referral slip and directions. They usually can accommodate walk-ins, but it’s always a good idea to call ahead to confirm. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, my office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you develop a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… get those tests done quick, okay? I appreciate you gettin’ me in and out of here.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Pithan. We'll get those tests scheduled as quickly as possible. The receptionist will take care of all the paperwork and scheduling. Here's the referral slip and the contact information for the imaging center. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks.
