DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s the itching, really. Just… everywhere. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not terrible, but constant. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: “Everywhere,” you say. Alright. And when you say a few weeks, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, hmm… around the 20th of July, I believe. Yes, definitely after the 20th. I remember because that was when I started helping Mrs. Henderson with her garden again after her hip surgery. She's a lovely woman, but her roses have thorns! Maybe it was something then? I don't usually get scratches like this, though.
DOCTOR: Roses, you say. Interesting. And these scratches… were they limited to your arms, or did you notice them elsewhere?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not just my arms. My legs too, a bit on my back… hard to reach, so I didn't notice right away. And my chest, I think. It's not like big, obvious scratches, more… little red bumps, mostly. And they itch! It's not painful, thankfully, just… relentlessly itchy.
DOCTOR: Relentlessly itchy. Right. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the bumps – any dryness, scaling, blistering, or discoloration?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A little dryness, maybe? I've always had dry skin in the winter, but it feels a bit… worse than usual, now that you mention it. No blisters, no discoloration that I've seen. And no swelling, either. Just the bumps and the itching, and the dry feeling. I did switch laundry detergents a few weeks ago too… a new brand, supposed to be hypoallergenic. Maybe that's it?
DOCTOR: A new detergent… and when did you make that switch, relative to when the itching started?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Actually, it was right before the itching started. Maybe a week before, around July 15th. It was on sale at the general store, said it was good for sensitive skin. Seems ironic now, doesn't it? I really thought I was doing something good for my clothes… and myself, apparently.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s often the most well-intentioned changes that cause problems. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, no chills, no fatigue. No trouble breathing or anything like that. My appetite's been normal, and I've been sleeping alright. Just… the itching. It’s really the only thing bothering me. I did feel a little… more tired than usual last week, but I figured that was just the heat. It's been awfully warm lately. It makes everything feel worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just Medicare, keeps me ticking. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, been on that for years. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they act up, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month. And a daily multivitamin, just to be safe. That's about it, really. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky with that, thankfully. I used to worry about bee stings when I was a boy, but I've never had a bad reaction. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I did get a rash once, years ago, from poison ivy, but that was a long time ago. No, I can’t think of anything I’m allergic to, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Ferneding, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. It’s necessary to properly assess the situation. If you would please remove your shirt and shorts, we can begin.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Of course. That's… understandable. I haven't taken my shirt off for a doctor in… well, a long time. Is there a room I can change in? I'd rather not… you know.
DOCTOR: We have a gown available, Mr. Ferneding. It's standard procedure. Please step behind the curtain and change. I will be right back to examine you.
PATIENT: Okay. A gown. Right. That’s… better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Moderate erythema noted across the anterior chest and abdomen. Scattered, excoriated papules consistent with scratching. No vesicles or bullae observed. Erythema also present on the upper arms and legs, but less pronounced. No evidence of systemic involvement. Skin appears dry to the touch. No lymphadenopathy detected. Well, it certainly looks like an irritant contact dermatitis, most likely secondary to the new laundry detergent. But we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that… doesn’t sound too bad, does it? An irritant. I figured it might be something like that. It just… itches so much! So, what do we do about it? Is there a cream or something? I'm just hoping it doesn't last forever. This is driving me a bit mad.
DOCTOR: It’s rarely “just” anything, Mr. Ferneding. While it is likely a simple irritant contact dermatitis, we must be thorough. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying systemic issues. We will also perform a skin scraping to rule out fungal infection or scabies. And, naturally, you will discontinue use of the new laundry detergent immediately. We will prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to reduce the inflammation and itching. Apply it thinly twice daily. If symptoms do not improve within a week, or worsen at any point, you will return for further evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… like a lot. Blood tests and scraping… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I understand. Discontinue the detergent, apply the cream… twice a day. A week, you said? If it doesn’t get better in a week? I hope it doesn't take that long. It's just… very irritating. Pun intended, I suppose. Will the cream require a prescription? And is there anything else I should be doing? Any special soap, maybe? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Yes, the cream will require a prescription. It is a mid-potency corticosteroid. As for other measures… use a mild, fragrance-free soap. Avoid harsh chemicals, abrasive fabrics, and prolonged exposure to heat and humidity. And do not scratch. I understand it’s itchy, but scratching will only exacerbate the inflammation and potentially lead to secondary infection. I will also send you home with a handout detailing proper skincare practices for dermatitis. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything. Cream, mild soap, no scratching, handout… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. I'll try to follow your instructions as best as I can. Hopefully, this will clear up quickly. I just want to be comfortable again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. The results should be available within 48 hours. I expect you to contact the office immediately if you experience any fever, chills, or signs of infection. My nurse will provide you with discharge instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment if necessary.
