DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Shteynberg, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. And please, just Angelle is fine. Honestly, I haven’t got all day to be formal. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well, Angelle. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about having a baby. And I want to do it right. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I want to make sure everything is… working properly. I don't want any of those… problems people have. Is that clear enough? I've heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: Right. You're wanting to…conceive?
PATIENT: Conceive? Is that what you call it? Yes, exactly. I want to have a baby, and I want to be certain there won't be any difficulties. I don’t need a lecture on the… process. Just tell me what tests you want to do to make sure everything is in order. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: You're 51. And you're wanting to start a family…now?
PATIENT: Yes, now. Is that a problem? I assure you, I'm quite healthy for my age. I cycle, don't I? And I eat… reasonably well. I don't understand why you’re making such a fuss. It's my body, isn’t it? Just tell me what you need to know. Do you need a list of my bicycle repair clients? Because I'm quite strong, you know. Very capable.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your age, there are…certain considerations. We’ll need a thorough review of your medical history. Have you had children before?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, that's rather personal, isn’t it? Look, I don’t need a life story discussion. Just tell me what tests will confirm I’m… viable. I've got appointments to keep. People rely on me for their bicycles, you know. They can’t just wait around.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with a basic blood panel – complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests. We’ll also need to check your hormone levels – FSH, LH, estradiol. And given your age, an Anti-Mullerian Hormone test to assess your ovarian reserve.
PATIENT: Ovarian… what now? Honestly, this is already too much. Can’t you just tell me if I’m able to have a baby or not? All these… words. And what exactly is ovarian reserve? Is that something bad? And how much will all this cost? I’m on Medicare, you know. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Ovarian reserve refers to the quantity and quality of your remaining eggs. It decreases with age. The test helps us determine your likelihood of conceiving with your own eggs. As for cost...Medicare should cover a portion, but I cannot give you an exact figure. You'll need to check with your insurance provider. Now, do you have any allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m Hungarian, we’re practically immune to everything. And medications… just a little something for my back, sometimes. I lift heavy bicycles all day, you know. It's a demanding profession. What difference does that make anyway? Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this or are you just trying to confuse me with medical jargon? I’d rather just know yes or no. Can you do that?
DOCTOR: The medication is important, Angelle. It could interact with fertility treatments, should they be necessary. What is the name of the medication, and what dosage do you take?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. It's… Voltaren. Just a little, when my back flares up. 50 milligrams, usually. And I don’t take it every day. Only when I've been fixing a particularly stubborn derailleur, or something. It’s just a pain reliever. Do you really need to know the precise angle of the derailleur? This is ridiculous. Look, can we just skip ahead to the actual tests? I haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Voltaren is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and prolonged use can affect ovulation. Alright. Let's proceed with the blood work. And I'll need a pelvic exam, and potentially an ultrasound to assess your uterus and ovaries. We'll schedule those for tomorrow. Now, do you have any family history of early menopause or infertility?
PATIENT: Early menopause? Good heavens, no! My grandmother lived to be ninety, fixing bicycles right up until the end! And my mother… well, she didn’t have children, but that was by choice. She preferred porcelain dolls. It’s hardly relevant. Look, can’t you just take the tests and tell me what’s what? I’ve got a client waiting for a tune-up. A very important client. This is taking far too long. Honestly, you’re making me nervous. .
DOCTOR: Fine. We'll schedule the tests. But I need you to understand, given your age and medical history, the chances of successful conception are…low. Don't get your hopes up. And be prepared for the possibility of needing assisted reproductive technologies. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Here's the lab requisition. . .
