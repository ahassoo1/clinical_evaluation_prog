DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes. Well, it's my joints, mostly. They get…stuck, in the mornings. It's hard to get going, you know? Not painful, exactly, just… stiff. It's been happening for… a while now. I forget how long, really. A long while.
DOCTOR: Hmm, “stuck,” you say. And it’s worse in the mornings?
PATIENT: Yes, mornings are the worst. Definitely. Like… when I get out of bed. Or sometimes, if I'm sitting for too long, and then try to stand up. It feels like… rusty hinges, maybe? I don’t know. It loosens up after I move around a bit, though. Then I’m okay… mostly. It just takes a while to get going. Do you… understand what I mean? I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Voner. Rusty hinges is a good way to put it. And it eases with movement. How long would you say it takes to “loosen up” after getting out of bed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. Maybe… half an hour? Sometimes more? It depends on the weather, I think. Cold days are worse. And… what was I saying? Oh, yes. It's hard to say for sure. I just know it takes a while before I feel… normal. Not speedy, you know? Just… able to move without feeling like an old… well, an older woman! Sorry. I ramble.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Voner. We'll get to the bottom of it. So, this stiffness… does it affect all your joints, or are some worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. I think… my hands are the worst. Makes it hard to do things, like buttoning my coat or… opening jars. And my knees. Getting up and down stairs is… not my favorite. My shoulders bother me sometimes too, but not as much as my hands and knees. Everything kind of aches a little, if I'm honest, but those are the main ones. Is that… helpful? I feel like I'm just listing body parts now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Voner. Don’t apologize. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints – particularly your hands and knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. I don't think so. Not usually. Sometimes, after a long day, my hands feel a little puffy, maybe? But not like… big and red. Just… a little bit bigger than usual. I mostly just notice the stiffness, not the swelling. I’m not sure. I’m not very good at noticing those things, I guess. Sorry. Does that make sense? I hope that’s what you meant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Voner, that's perfectly alright. We’re getting there. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with anything like arthritis or any other joint problems before?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to take me to the doctor for everything, and I mostly just… let him handle it. He always knew what to ask. I haven't been to a doctor much since he passed, to be honest. It's just… hard. I don't think I have arthritis. I’m not sure what that even feels like, really. Sorry, I'm not very helpful am I?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any other medical conditions you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my blood pressure is a little high, the nurse told me when I had it checked at the pharmacy last year. She said I should watch my salt intake, but… I forget. And I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. It healed okay, but it still aches sometimes when it’s cold. Other than that… not that I remember. I mostly just… get tired easily, but who doesn’t these days? Sorry. I feel like I'm just rambling again.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s right! Yes. I take a little pill for my blood pressure. Just one, every morning. It's… pink, I think. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take something over-the-counter for the pain. It's… ibuprofen? Is that right? My neighbor told me about it. It helps a little, but not much. Sorry. I don’t really keep track of things like that. I just take what people tell me to when I'm hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on with your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt. I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to doctors, to be honest. But I trust you. Whatever you think is best. Sorry. I'm just… nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit on the examination table for me. First, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you make a fist for me, and then spread your fingers out as wide as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Here we go. . Okay, making a fist… like this? . And now spreading them out… . Ooh, that feels a little stiff. Sorry. Is that what you wanted? I’m not very good at this, am I?
DOCTOR: Hmm. "Mild tenderness to palpation on the dorsal aspect of both hands, particularly the metacarpophalangeal joints. No visible swelling or redness noted. Range of motion slightly limited, but no crepitus palpable. Wrist flexion and extension are within normal limits, but some discomfort reported with full range of motion.” Now, please turn your hands over.
PATIENT: Okay, turning them over… . Oh, that feels a little better, actually. Less… pointy, maybe? Is that what you wanted? I'm just… trying to help. Sorry. I hope I’m not making this harder for you.
DOCTOR: "Tenderness to palpation noted on the volar aspect of the wrists bilaterally. No visible deformities. Now, let’s move on to your knees. Please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can, and then straighten them out slowly for me."
PATIENT: Oh dear… This is… not my favorite. There. That's about as far as I can go. Ooh, that feels… creaky. Like old floorboards. Sorry. I hope you can tell what you need to from all this. I’m not very flexible, to be honest. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Crepitus palpable with both knees during flexion and extension. Mild tenderness to palpation along the medial joint line bilaterally. Range of motion is limited, approximately 90 degrees of flexion in both knees. No effusion noted. Palpable warmth present in both knees, but no visible erythema.” "Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just as a general check. Please take a deep breath."
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Like this? I always feel silly when they listen to my heart. Like they’re looking for something wrong. But I understand it’s important. I hope I'm not breathing too loud. Sorry. Is that okay? I can try to breathe slower if you want. It’s just… a little nerve-wracking, you know?
DOCTOR: “Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi noted.” “Alright, Ms. Voner. That completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the findings today, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis. It's a degenerative joint condition, which means the cartilage in your joints has worn down over time.”
PATIENT: Oh… Osteo…arthritis? . That sounds… serious. Is it… bad? I don’t think I’ve ever had that before. Is there… a cure? I’m a bit scared, Doctor. Sorry. I just… I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair. Is that silly? I just want to be able to keep doing things, you know? Opening jars, and… walking to the store. Sorry. This is all a bit much. I feel like I need a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Voner. And no, it’s not a death sentence. Osteoarthritis is very common, especially as we get older. It's not usually a rapidly progressing condition, and most people can manage it well with treatment and lifestyle changes. There isn’t a cure, unfortunately, but we can definitely work on relieving your symptoms and slowing down its progression. We can start with some simple things – over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, as you've been doing, can help with the pain and inflammation. We can also discuss physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. And weight management, if applicable, can also reduce the stress on your joints. We'll need to get some X-rays to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition. Would you be willing to schedule those today?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. That sounds… manageable, I think. Physical therapy… I don't know. I’m not very good at exercise. But I’m willing to try, if it helps. And X-rays… yes, that sounds… sensible. . Yes, please. Let's schedule the X-rays. And… what about the pain? Will the ibuprofen be enough? Sorry, I’m just… worried. I don't want to be in a lot of pain. Can we talk about other options if it doesn’t work?
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Ms. Voner. We can start with ibuprofen, but if that's not enough, we have other options. We can consider stronger pain relievers, topical creams, or even injections directly into the joints. We'll take things one step at a time. I'll write you a prescription for ibuprofen, and I’ll also give you a referral to a physical therapist. Let’s get those X-rays scheduled first, then we’ll see the results and discuss a more tailored plan for you. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. One step at a time. That’s good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It's… less scary now. And the physical therapy… I'll try my best. Do I need to bring anything to the X-ray appointment? Sorry. I always forget these things. And… will they tell me the results right away?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to bring anything specific, Ms. Voner. Just your insurance information, if applicable. And no, they won't tell you the results right away. The radiologist will need to review the images and send a report to me. I'll contact you as soon as I have them, usually within a few days, to discuss the findings and our next steps. I’m going to print out a referral form for the physical therapist and the prescription for ibuprofen for you now. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. It’s just… getting old is hard, you know? Sorry. I ramble. I guess I should just wait here while you print those things? And then I can go home? It’s probably best if I get off my feet for a while.
DOCTOR: Yes, please just have a seat, and I’ll be right with you. And yes, resting when your joints are bothering you is a good idea. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Here's my card with the office number. “Take care now, Ms. Voner.”
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. . I will. . You take care too. Thank you again for everything. Oh, and Doctor? Don't worry, I won't forget my name this time!
