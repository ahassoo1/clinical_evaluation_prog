DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning, Doctor. Honestly? It’s probably nothing, but my mother… she’s been having some issues, and it's got me a little worked up. A lot of heart problems on her side of the family, you see. I just want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, really.
DOCTOR: Preventative is good, very good. Family history is certainly important. So, you’re not experiencing any symptoms yourself currently?
PATIENT: No, not exactly symptoms. Just… anxious, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? It's more about knowing, you know? My ex-wife always said I worry too much, and she wasn’t wrong. But this feels… different. Like I should get checked just in case. It's probably silly.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all to be proactive about your health, Mr. Theriot. Anxiety can manifest physically, and fatigue is… well, it’s common, but warrants investigation. Let’s try to gather a bit more information. Can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly, not much. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. Standard childhood stuff – chickenpox, maybe. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, playing cricket. Nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses. I eat… reasonably well. Try to, anyway. Look, I'm an engineer, not a doctor. I’m good at fixing things, not being things. Is this going to be a long list?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing major. Just routine questions, I assure you. No surgeries then?
PATIENT: No. Definitely no surgeries. I… I don’t even like hospitals, to be frank. Just the smell, it gets to me. Look, is this family history thing a big deal? Because my mother is being… dramatic, as usual. And I don’t want to waste your time if it’s nothing. She always overreacts to everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll keep it brief. And family history is important. It doesn't necessarily mean you’ll experience the same issues, but it helps us understand your risk factors. To clarify, what specific heart problems has your mother been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, she had some… arrhythmia, I think? Something about an irregular heartbeat. And she's been complaining about shortness of breath, but she also complains about the weather, so… hard to say. My aunt, her sister, had high blood pressure, and my grandfather… I think he had a stroke. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t remember the details. She never really talked about it. Just… a lot of heart stuff. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Arrhythmia and a family history of stroke and hypertension are relevant. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke. Rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And recreational drugs? Please. I'm an engineer. I deal with precision and calculations, not… that. Though, I do drink a lot of coffee. Does that count? It’s the only way I get through the day.
DOCTOR: Coffee… yes, that can affect heart rate, but we'll factor that in. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise… Look, I walk. A lot. To and from work. And I occasionally tinker with things in the garage, which requires a bit of physical effort. It’s not like I’m running marathons or anything. I used to play badminton, but I haven't had the time lately. Work’s been… demanding. Is that good enough? I’m not exactly a gym person. Honestly, I find it… pointless. Spending an hour on a treadmill? Seems a waste of time when I could be building something.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, moderate activity. We'll consider that. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m pretty good with most things. I mean, I’m allergic to incompetence, but I don't think that's what you're asking. Seriously though, no known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And, honestly, Doctor, is this going to lead to a whole battery of tests? Because I really don’t have time for that. My department head is already breathing down my neck about that new project.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Mr. Theriot. Based on what you’ve told me – family history, moderate activity, no allergies – it would be prudent to perform a basic physical exam and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Perhaps some blood work to check cholesterol and blood sugar as well. It's a standard precaution given your family history, and it will give us a baseline to work with. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? Look, I came here for reassurance, not a full medical investigation. I’m a perfectly healthy individual. I eat reasonably well, I walk, and I don’t partake in any reckless activities. Is this absolutely necessary? Because if it's just going to tell me what I already know - that I’m fine - I’m not sure it’s worth the hassle. My ex-wife would be thrilled if I wasted a whole afternoon in a doctor’s office. It'll give her something to talk about.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your reluctance. And I apologize if this feels invasive. However, preventative medicine is about identifying potential risks before they become problems. The EKG is a quick, non-invasive test that can detect arrhythmias or other abnormalities. The blood work will give us a more comprehensive picture of your cardiovascular health. It's not about assuming you’re unwell, it’s about being thorough. Think of it as a routine maintenance check for your body. And frankly, given the heart issues on your mother’s side, it's a responsible step to take. It will take less than an hour, and will give us peace of mind, one way or another. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But if everything comes back normal, I’m holding you personally responsible for the lost productivity. And if my ex-wife finds out about this, I’m sending you the therapy bill. Alright, let’s just get it over with. Where do we start? And please, tell me it won't be painful. I have a low tolerance for needles.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I assure you, it won’t be painful. The blood draw is usually quick and relatively painless. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – no needles involved there. Let’s start with the EKG. I’ll have the nurse come in and prepare you. She’ll explain the procedure in detail. Nurse, could you please come in and assist Mr. Theriot with an EKG?
