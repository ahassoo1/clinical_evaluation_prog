DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But it is happening more often now, and my blood pressure is…high, the doctor told me. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Forgetfulness and high blood pressure – those are both things we can definitely look into. Let’s start with the forgetfulness. Can you give me some examples of what you’ve been forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just yesterday, I went to the market for milk and…I completely forgot why I was there when I arrived. I stood there, looking at the produce…and nothing. I had to return home to remember. And the week before, I misplaced my keys…not just where they were, but I forgot I even had them for a time. It is…unsettling. It is not like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is unsettling. It sounds like these aren't just typical "senior moments," as they say. And you mentioned your blood pressure is high – do you know what your readings have been, or when you were last told about it?
PATIENT: Yes. My neighbor, she is a nurse, she checks it for me sometimes. Last week, it was…160 over 95, I believe. She said it was quite high and I should see a doctor. I do not remember the exact date, but it was after the 20th of July. I do not always feel unwell, but I worry about what it means. I take no medicine for it now.
DOCTOR: Okay, 160 over 95 is elevated, and you're right to be concerned. We'll need to get that checked again today to confirm. And the forgetfulness…has it been getting worse gradually, or has it been more sudden?
PATIENT: It is…gradual, I think. It was small things at first. Like forgetting a name, or where I put my glasses. But in the last month, it feels…faster. More frequent. And…bigger things, like forgetting why I am doing something. It is frightening, Doctor. I live alone, you see. My husband…he passed five years ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very worrying, and living alone certainly adds to that stress. Okay, let’s do a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but that was all. And a small operation on my knee, many years ago. Nothing serious. I have always been…quite healthy, until now. My husband, he had…heart trouble. But I do not have any problems like that. I do not take any regular medication, except sometimes a pain reliever for my arthritis. It is not very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and occasional pain relief – good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I have taken many different medicines over the years for small things – headaches, colds – and never had a reaction. I am not sensitive to anything like that. I do not…wear any jewelry, so no metal allergies. I’m quite simple, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I live in a small house, very quiet neighborhood. I do not smoke, I have never smoked. I drink…a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that is all. I try to walk every day, but it is difficult with the arthritis. I cook for myself, mostly. I do not have many visitors. It is…a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And about your family history – did any of your parents or siblings have problems with memory loss, or heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother, she had…some confusion towards the end of her life. The doctor said it was “old age,” but she forgot things often. And my father…he had a very bad heart. He died young, from a heart attack, I believe. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. He took medicine for it, always. He is still alive, but very unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – a family history of both memory issues and heart problems. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I understand. I want to know what is happening. Please, do what you need to do. I will cooperate fully. I am…a bit nervous, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start by taking your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Okay, that's 158 over 92. Still elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I'm hearing some slight crackles in your lungs. That could be due to a number of things, and we may need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a few simple memory tests. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date…let me see. It is…August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd. I am quite sure of that. I remember writing it down on my calendar this morning. Though…I sometimes have trouble remembering things from earlier in the day. It is strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Please, tell me the words. I will try my best to remember them.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please remember those, and I’ll ask you to repeat them later. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to get a better sense of your cognitive function. What year is it currently?
PATIENT: It is…2025. Yes, definitely 2025. I keep hearing it on the news, you see. There is…much happening in the world. It is a bit overwhelming sometimes. Though…I do not always remember what is happening. Just that it is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you tell me your full name and date of birth?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My name is Venus Alvará. A-l-v-a-r-a. And my date of birth is…October 14th, 1942. I always remember my birthday. It is a special day. Though…sometimes I forget what day of the week it falls on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat the three words I asked you earlier: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Apple…table…and… I…I cannot remember the third word. I know there was a third word…something small and round…but I cannot recall it. I am so sorry. This is…very upsetting. I should remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. That’s alright. Don't worry about it. It’s not a formal test, just a quick assessment. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, we have a few things to consider. Your blood pressure is elevated, and you’re experiencing some memory issues. The crackles in your lungs also warrant further investigation. I suspect there could be a few things going on. It could be related to high blood pressure, but we need to rule out other possibilities, such as early signs of cognitive impairment or a possible infection in your lungs. I want to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also want to get a chest X-ray to check your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds…sensible. I want to know what is happening, and if you think tests are necessary, then I will have them. Blood tests and an X-ray…yes, that is perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do to find out what is wrong. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. For the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks, except water. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning. The chest X-ray can be done anytime after the blood tests, so we can arrange that for tomorrow afternoon. I’ll also give you a prescription for a blood pressure medication to start tonight – it’s a low dose, and it should help bring your pressure down while we wait for the test results. It's called Lisinopril, 5mg, once daily. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any other drugs, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have no allergies, as I said before. And I do not take any other medications, not even pain relievers currently. Just the occasional aspirin for a headache, many months ago. No supplements. I am quite simple, really. Lisinopril…5mg…once daily. I will write that down. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, while we are waiting for the test results, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Take it twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – and write down the readings. Bring those readings with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment next week. Also, it's important to stay hydrated and get regular, gentle exercise, as tolerated. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just one. You mentioned…cognitive impairment. Is that…is that what you think is happening to me? Is it…dementia? I am very worried about that, you see. I have heard…terrible things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus, that’s a perfectly valid question, and it’s good you’re asking it. It’s too early to say definitively whether you have any cognitive impairment, and certainly too early to diagnose dementia. The memory issues you’re experiencing could be caused by a number of things, including high blood pressure, stress, or even certain vitamin deficiencies. The tests we’re ordering will help us rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I want to be very clear: I am not diagnosing you with dementia at this time. We need more information before we can make any conclusions. I understand your worry, and I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together, step by step. We’ll get to the bottom of what’s causing your symptoms and develop a plan to address them. Do you feel reassured by that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is…very reassuring, thank you. I appreciate your honesty and your patience. I feel much better knowing that you are not jumping to conclusions. I will take the tests, and I will monitor my blood pressure as you instructed. And I will come back next week with the readings. Thank you again for your time. I think…I think that is all for now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venus. You’re very welcome. Remember, if anything changes or you feel worse, don't hesitate to call. We’ll see you next week. Here’s a copy of the lab requisition and the prescription. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
