DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’m having some trouble breathing when I lie down flat. It’s been… well, a few weeks now, I suppose. I just want to get it sorted if I can. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of shortness of breath when lying flat. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it isn't constant, you understand. It only happens when I’m trying to rest. If I’m sitting up, or even walking around, I’m fine. But as soon as I get comfortable and lie down… that’s when it starts. It feels like… like there’s a weight on my chest, and it’s hard to get a good breath. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… difficult. I used to sleep so soundly, but now I have to prop myself up with pillows. Several of them, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's positional – meaning it happens when you lie down – and it feels like pressure or weight on your chest, not pain. And you're using multiple pillows now to sleep comfortably. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t had a cough or any chest pain, like I said. My ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day, but I’ve always had that, to be honest. I haven't been feeling overly tired, and my appetite is alright. I’m not sure if that matters, but I’ve also noticed my weight has been pretty stable. I weighed myself just last week – 142 pounds, same as always. I suppose that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, no chest pain. Some ankle swelling, which you've experienced before. Weight is stable at 142 pounds. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago… must have been thirty years now. And I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on medication, and it’s been under control ever since. Other than that… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and mumps, but nothing serious. I also had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't bother me much anymore. I haven't been to the doctor for much lately, truthfully. Everything’s usually been alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal 30 years ago, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis. And you haven’t had many recent medical visits. Do you know what medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill. I get it refilled every month from the pharmacy. Oh dear, I wish I could remember the name! It starts with an 'A', I believe… Amlodipine? Is that right? Yes, I think it is. Amlodipine, 5 milligrams. I take one every morning. Is that important? I can ask my daughter, she keeps a list of all my medications. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Amlodipine 5mg daily. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about everything. I used to help my grandmother gather herbs, and she always said a little bit of everything is good for you. I haven't had any problems with bee stings or anything like that, either. No allergies at all, so far as I know. I’m quite lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, before we do a quick exam, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… well, my mother had heart trouble when she got older, and she eventually needed a pacemaker. My father was very healthy, lived to be 85, but he had diabetes. My brother has high blood pressure, like me. And my sister… she’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. That's about all I can remember. It’s not a particularly exciting family history, I’m afraid. Mostly just the usual aging ailments, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with heart trouble and a pacemaker, father with diabetes, and brother with high blood pressure. Thank you. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready. Please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your ankles are a little swollen, as you mentioned. And listening to your lungs, I hear some crackles, especially on the lower lobes, both sides. Your heart rate and rhythm are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. I'm documenting these findings now. This information, along with your history, leads me to suspect possible congestive heart failure. However, we need to do a few more tests to confirm that. We’ll start with an EKG and a chest X-ray, and I’d also like to order a BNP blood test. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A BNP test, you said? Is that a blood test? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… Yes, I have questions. What causes that? And what does it mean if I have that? Will I need to be hospitalized? I’m not sure I understand… and I really would like to be clear about what's going on. I don't like surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly reasonable to have questions. Congestive heart failure doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is about to stop working. It simply means your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be, and fluid is building up in your lungs and other parts of your body – that's why you're having trouble breathing and the swelling in your ankles. Several things can cause it – high blood pressure, like yours, is a common one. Sometimes it’s due to heart valve problems or a previous heart attack. The BNP test is a blood test. It measures a hormone released by the heart when it’s under stress. It helps us determine how likely it is that you have heart failure and how severe it is. Whether or not you’ll need to be hospitalized depends on the results of the tests and how you’re feeling. Mild cases can often be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. More severe cases may require a hospital stay. We’re not at the point of making any definitive decisions yet. Let’s get the tests done first, and then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan together. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does make a bit more sense, thank you. So it’s not necessarily something terrible, just something that needs to be looked at. And the medication I'm already taking for my blood pressure… that’s supposed to help prevent this, right? The hormone test… will it be painful? And where will I go to get those tests done? I like to know these things beforehand. It's just… I don't get out much, and the thought of going to different places is rather… daunting.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, and I’m glad you’re speaking up. The medication you’re taking is helping to control your blood pressure, which is a good thing and helps protect your heart. However, sometimes despite medication, heart failure can still develop, especially over time. The blood test will not be painful – it's just a quick pinprick to draw a small amount of blood. And the EKG is painless as well – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. You can get both tests done right here at the clinic. Our lab technician, Sarah, is very skilled and gentle. She’ll take care of you. I’ll write up the orders now, and then I’ll have the nurse, Michael, come in and draw your blood and do the EKG. It shouldn't take more than about 30-40 minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better. Right here at the clinic… that’s good. Sarah and Michael… I’ll remember those names. Thirty to forty minutes… I can manage that. Is there anything I should do before the tests? Should I avoid caffeine? Or perhaps eat something first? I always worry about getting lightheaded, you see. I’d like to be as prepared as possible. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my questions. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. It’s my job to answer your questions and make sure you feel comfortable. It’s good you asked about preparation. I recommend you avoid caffeine for a few hours before the tests, as it can sometimes affect the heart rhythm. Eating a light snack beforehand is a good idea, to prevent lightheadedness. Nothing too heavy, just something to keep your energy up. And let Michael know if you’re prone to feeling lightheaded – he’ll make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. I’ll go ahead and write up the orders and let Michael know to expect you. We'll get those tests done, and then we'll take it from there. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. You've put my mind at ease a bit. I’ll just wait here, and Michael will come get me when he’s ready? And… I’ll try not to worry. Easier said than done, I suppose. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Stop me if I ramble. I have a tendency to do that when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Maribeth. And please, don’t worry about rambling. I’m happy to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. Yes, Michael will come get you when he’s ready. He’ll explain the process, and if you feel at all uncomfortable during the tests, just let him know. He's very good at putting patients at ease. I'll leave you to relax for a bit. I’ll check back in with you after the tests.
