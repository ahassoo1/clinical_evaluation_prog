DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s about my breathing. It gets… difficult when I try to lie flat. It’s been happening for a little while now, and I thought it was just getting old, but it doesn't seem to be getting better. I want to get it sorted out if I can.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficult breathing when lying flat, you say. And how long has this “little while” been?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… about three months, I’d say. Maybe a bit longer. It started gradually, just noticing I preferred to sleep with a couple of pillows. Now… now it’s hard even with the pillows. It feels like something is pressing on me, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And is this difficulty breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I’m trying to sleep, or resting. During the day, if I’m up and about, it’s not so bad. Unless I really exert myself, then it gets a little short. But lying down is the worst. It's very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me see… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my ankles do feel a bit puffy at the end of the day. I hadn't really connected it to the breathing, though. Just thought it was the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any chest pain, or palpitations – a racing or fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And my heart… it feels normal. It doesn’t race or anything. It just feels… tired sometimes, but that could be my age, I suppose. I don’t think it’s fluttering.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your medical history. I see you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril, and some osteoarthritis. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. And I was divorced… a long time ago. Does that count? I’ve been mostly healthy, though. The osteoarthritis is just a nuisance, mostly in my knees. The doctor keeps telling me to do exercises, but… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. The gallbladder removal is pertinent. And any family history of heart problems, lung disease, or blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he had something with his lungs. Emphysema, I think it was. He smoked, though. A lot. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. As for blood clots... I don't recall anyone in my family having those.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your ankles for swelling, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… sensible. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still. Though I might fidget a little. Old habits, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Yes, I do note some mild edema in both ankles. Lungs are clear, but a slight murmur is audible. Blood pressure is 140/90 today. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, which isn’t entirely surprising given your history. The murmur is likely benign, but we should investigate further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. We'll also do some bloodwork to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes for the swelling and shortness of breath. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds like a lot. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, alright. An X-ray and bloodwork… and whatever an EKG is. I just want to be able to breathe normally again, Doctor. I don't want a lot of fuss, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course. The EKG is a simple test, just some stickers on your chest to check your heart rhythm. The bloodwork will involve a standard blood draw. We'll schedule those for you today. In the meantime, I want you to elevate your legs whenever possible, and limit your salt intake. And if your shortness of breath worsens significantly, or you experience any chest pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Elevate my legs, less salt… and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. It all sounds very… serious. But alright. When will I have the tests? I have a quilting circle next Tuesday. I wouldn't want to miss that.
DOCTOR: We can get the bloodwork done this afternoon, and the X-ray scheduled for tomorrow morning. That should give us enough time before your quilting circle. Let's get the orders sent to the lab and radiology now. Here are the requisitions. The lab and radiology staff will guide you from there. We'll review the results when they come back and discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I just want to get back to my quilting.
