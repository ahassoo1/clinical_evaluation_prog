DOCTOR: Hi Delano, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… my eyesight. It's been going. Not suddenly, mind you. A gradual decline. It’s… bothersome, to say the least. A man needs to see things properly, you understand. It's impacting my work, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A gradual decline in vision can definitely be worrisome, especially when it affects your work. Let's get some more details. When did you first notice this change, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It must have been… oh, six months ago, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It wasn’t dramatic, you see. Just… things weren't as sharp as they used to be. Difficult to read small print, mostly. I initially dismissed it as fatigue. A man my age, you understand, has responsibilities. One doesn't simply… notice things. But it's gotten steadily worse.
DOCTOR: Right, six months. And it’s been a gradual worsening since then, primarily with reading small print. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your peripheral vision – like difficulty seeing things out of the sides of your eyes?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision… now, that's a good question. I suppose… not drastically. I wouldn’t say I’ve tripped over anything, if that’s what you mean. Though, I did nearly walk into a doorframe at the grocery store last week. Probably just wasn't paying attention. A man has things on his mind, Doctor. It’s likely nothing to do with my… eyesight. I simply pride myself on being observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant changes, but maybe a slight decrease in awareness of your surroundings. Good to know. Have you noticed any blurry vision, double vision, or halos around lights?
PATIENT: Halos around lights… no, not precisely. Things do seem a little… washed out, perhaps? Less vibrant, you could say. And there's a sort of… film over everything sometimes. Not constant, mind you. But it's not as clear as it used to be. Double vision? No, thankfully not. I can't abide things being… duplicated. It’s rather unsettling, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slight blurring and a feeling of things being washed out, a sort of film occasionally. That's helpful. Have you had any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my health? Well, I had a bout of the flu last winter. Nasty thing, that flu. Kept me bedridden for a week. And my blood pressure has been… a little elevated, the last time I checked. Though, I’m sure it's just stress. A man in my position has plenty of stress, Doctor. Dealing with… people all day. It’s draining. Apart from that, I’m… reasonably healthy, all things considered. I don’t indulge, you see. No excessive drinking, no smoking. A clean lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Okay, flu last winter, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you know what your blood pressure readings were, if you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t concern myself with numbers. I went to the pharmacy for a quick check, and the… young man behind the counter said it was a little high. I didn’t press him for specifics. A man shouldn't need to memorize medical data. It's the doctor's job to keep track of such things, isn't it? I simply thought it was best to mention it, in case it was… relevant.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. No specific numbers, but you recall it being slightly elevated. Okay. And just to get a complete picture, what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I pride myself on not needing medications. I believe in natural remedies, a healthy diet, and a strong constitution. I've never been one to rely on… artificial solutions. The only thing I take regularly is a multivitamin. And that’s simply to supplement my diet, you understand. A man needs to maintain himself, even in this… state.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. I’ve been fortunate enough to never suffer from allergies. A strong Cherokee bloodline, you see. We’re resilient people. Though, I find certain perfumes… overwhelming. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Simply a matter of… sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies, just sensitivity to perfumes. Okay. And lastly, have there been any significant changes in your family history regarding eye conditions or other medical problems?
PATIENT: Family history… now that's a bit difficult. My mother passed away when I was young, and I wasn’t particularly close to my father. He wasn't one for… sharing. I believe my grandmother had some sort of… ailment with her eyes, towards the end of her life. Cataracts, perhaps? Though, I couldn't say for certain. It was a long time ago. And, truthfully, Doctor, we weren’t a family that discussed such things openly. It wasn't considered… proper. I’m afraid that’s the extent of my knowledge on the matter.
DOCTOR: Okay, grandmother may have had cataracts, but not certain. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Delano, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you've been experiencing a gradual decline in your vision over the past six months, primarily with reading. No double vision, no halos, just some blurring and a washed-out appearance. You have slightly elevated blood pressure, take a multivitamin, and have no known allergies. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick eye exam. It won't be anything invasive, just a few simple tests to check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and the health of your eyes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An exam, you say? Very well. Though, I must say, I find the necessity of such things… bothersome. A man’s time is valuable, Doctor. But if it’s required, I suppose I can indulge. Just… please be efficient. I have responsibilities to attend to. Let us get this over with, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I understand. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Alright, if you could please look straight ahead at that chart on the wall… we’ll start with your visual acuity. Can you read the smallest line you can see clearly?
PATIENT: Hmph. The letters are… rather small, aren't they? I can make out… a few on the third line, perhaps. But they’re… blurry. And the fourth line is… indistinct. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite obvious my vision isn’t what it used to be. Do we really need to go through all of this?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It appears your visual acuity is approximately 20/40 in both eyes. Alright, looking straight ahead… I’m just going to shine this light in your eyes. It won’t hurt, just a bit bright. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I do see some mild clouding of the lenses, which could indicate early cataract formation. No obvious signs of retinal detachment or macular degeneration at this time. Now, I’d like to check your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: Clouding, you say? Cataracts. Of course. It figures. Just what I needed. A man can’t even rely on his eyesight anymore. Peripheral vision, you say? Very well. Just get on with it. I have more important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to hold this screen in front of you, and I want you to focus on this central point. I’m going to present some numbers on the screen, and I want you to tell me what numbers you see in your peripheral vision – just on the edges of your sight. Don’t move your eyes, just try to identify the numbers as they appear. What number do you see here…?
PATIENT: I… I believe I see a… a six. Perhaps. It’s… faint. And… is that a two on the other side? It's difficult to say for certain. They’re… barely visible. Honestly, Doctor, this is rather pointless. It’s obvious my peripheral vision isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. That’s helpful. Okay, Delano, based on the eye exam, your visual acuity is 20/40 in both eyes. You have some mild clouding of the lenses, suggestive of early cataract formation. And your peripheral vision appears slightly constricted. Based on these findings, it appears you're experiencing age-related vision changes. The cataract formation is mild at this time, and we can monitor it. The constricted peripheral vision could be related to the cataracts, or it could be an early sign of glaucoma. To rule out glaucoma, I recommend a visual field test and an intraocular pressure check. This will require a referral to an ophthalmologist. Would you be willing to see an ophthalmologist for further evaluation?
PATIENT: An ophthalmologist? More specialists? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to lose patience. I came here for a simple eye exam, not a referral to a parade of doctors. Glaucoma? Really. Is there anything left that won’t befall a man my age? Very well. If it’s absolutely necessary, I suppose I can see an ophthalmologist. But I expect a swift resolution. I have more important matters to attend to. Just… get me the referral, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’m writing a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly-rated ophthalmologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here’s the referral information. They typically have good availability. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving at night and ensuring your glasses prescription is up-to-date. Also, be sure to protect your eyes from bright sunlight with sunglasses. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude the appointment?
PATIENT: Sunglasses, you say? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve managed perfectly well without needing advice on eyewear. No, I believe that’s all. I’ve wasted quite enough time here today. I expect a swift resolution from this ophthalmologist. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Delano. I’ll make a note of your concerns. Have a good day.
