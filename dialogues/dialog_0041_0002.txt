DOCTOR: Hello Zoie, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… the going to the bathroom. It’s hard now. Not like before, you know? It takes a long time, and… it doesn't all come out. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, that’s helpful. So, you're having some difficulty with urination… it’s taking longer than usual, and you feel like you're not emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Emptying… that’s a good word for it. It feels like there’s still some left, even after I try. And I have to… push a little. Not a lot, but more than I used to. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, a while now. Maybe a few months? I forget dates so easily these days.
DOCTOR: Right, a few months. And you’re having to strain a bit to get it all out. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in how it feels when you’re going – any burning, or pain, or a feeling like you have to go urgently, even when you don't?
PATIENT: Burning… no, not really burning. Sometimes a little uncomfortable, just… down there. But not pain, no. And urgently? No, I don’t feel like I have to rush. It just… takes a long time, and doesn't all come out. I don’t know if that makes sense. My husband usually helps me remember things, but he couldn't come today.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Zoie. Don't worry about remembering everything perfectly, we'll figure it out. No burning, just some general discomfort. And no feeling of urgency. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Urine… let me think. It looks normal, I think. The same color, maybe? I haven’t been looking at it closely, if that makes sense. Old eyes, you know? I don’t… smell anything different either. I usually just go and then flush. I don’t pay too much attention, sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Zoie. You shouldn’t feel like you need to be inspecting everything! It’s not bad at all. So, no noticeable changes in color or smell. Okay. Now, just to get a little more of a picture, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back recently?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t felt hot or anything. And chills… no, it's been pretty warm lately. Lower back… sometimes my back aches, but I just thought it was my age, you know? Old lady things. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. I put a warm cloth on it sometimes, and that helps. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills. A dull ache in your lower back that comes and goes, and a warm cloth helps. Alright. Now, before we do a quick examination, can you tell me a little about any medical conditions you have or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical conditions… that’s a long list, Doctor. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. And arthritis, of course, in my hands and knees. And… high blood pressure, I think? I take pills for it. Oh, and my husband says I had something with my water once, when I was young. He usually remembers all the details. I'm on Medicare, if that helps. Does that sound like enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder out, arthritis, high blood pressure, and something with your water when you were younger. Medicare is good to know. We can always check your records. “Something with your water” – do you remember anything more about that, even if it's just what the doctor said at the time?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, that was so long ago… I think he said something about an infection? In my kidneys, maybe? I was very sick, had to stay in the hospital. But that was… well, decades ago. I don't remember much else. It didn't bother me for years and years after, so I mostly forgot about it. My husband said it was a kidney infection, but he’s always been better at remembering things than me. I’m sorry I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible kidney infection a long time ago. No worries about not remembering perfectly, Zoie. We can look at your records to confirm. Let's do a quick examination, if that's alright with you. I just want to listen to your abdomen and check a few things. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh, alright then. If you think that's best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. It's been a long time since I’ve had a doctor listen to my tummy. Just let me know if it’s going to be cold, my skin is a little sensitive these days. And please, don't rush. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I'll be very gentle. I'll warm the stethoscope first, and we’ll take our time. Alright, if you could just take some deep breaths for me... Good. I'm listening to your abdomen now... Everything sounds… normal. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen… Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: No, that's alright. Just… a little pressure, that's all. Not pain. It feels… like a normal tummy poke. My husband used to poke my tummy when we were young. It’s a little ticklish, maybe, but no pain. Are you finding anything strange? I hope I'm not too old to fix, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, nothing alarming so far, Zoie. Just a little tenderness in your lower abdomen, but it's not unexpected given what you’ve told me. And you are not too old to fix, don't you worry about that! It’s always good to check things out. I'm just going to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs… This is just to make sure everything is working properly. Can you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little tickly again, but yes. And… is this the hammer thing? My grandson has one of those! He taps people on the knee. It’s a little strange, but not unpleasant. Is everything alright? You’re being very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the hammer thing. Everything seems to be working well there too. It appears your reflexes and sensation are normal. Based on what you've told me, and the examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing urinary retention – difficulty emptying your bladder completely. This can happen for a number of reasons, especially as we get older. It could be related to a weakened bladder muscle, a blockage, or even medication side effects. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… I don’t love tests, but if you think it’s important, Doctor, then alright. A weakened bladder… that sounds about right. I haven't been as strong as I used to be. What does the other thing mean, the volume test? And… will it hurt? I always worry about things hurting.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, Zoie. The post-void residual volume test is very simple and doesn't hurt at all. After you use the restroom, we’ll use a small device to measure how much urine is left in your bladder. It’s just like a quick scan, nothing invasive. The urine test is also very simple, just a sample in a cup. It will help us rule out an infection as the cause. Based on the results, we can discuss the best course of action. It could be as simple as doing bladder exercises, or we may need to consider medication. Does that sound a little less daunting?
PATIENT: Oh, a scan! That doesn’t sound so bad. And just a little cup… alright. You make it sound very easy, Doctor. And exercises… I can try exercises. I used to do a lot of walking, but my knees aren't what they used to be. So, exercises and a scan… alright. When can we do these tests? And… will I get the results right away? I’m a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: Wonderful! We can get the urine test done right here in the office. I’ll have the nurse bring you a cup, and she’ll explain everything. The post-void residual volume test can be done right after, once you've used the restroom. The results for the urine test will take a few minutes to process. The post-void residual volume test results are instant. I’ll go over everything with you immediately. We’ll figure this out together, Zoie. And don’t worry about being a worrier, it’s perfectly natural. Let me have the nurse come in and get you started with the urine sample. Then we'll move on to the bladder scan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Very good. Alright, let’s do it. I trust you, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. Tell the nurse I’m ready when she is. It's good to know someone is listening.
