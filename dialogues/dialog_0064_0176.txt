DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome. It’s good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Smetak. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and honestly, they’re driving me a bit mad. More than a bit, actually. It’s been over 48 hours now, I think.
DOCTOR: Hiccups for over 48 hours… that is quite persistent. Alright, let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Could you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Describe them? Hmm… well, they’re… normal hiccups, I guess? You know, that little jerk of the chest and the ‘hic’ sound. It’s not painful, not exactly. More… irritating. And they come and go, but they’re always there, lurking. Sometimes just a few minutes apart, other times… longer, but never a real break. I haven't really noticed anything that makes them worse or better, which is frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, "normal" hiccups, not painful, just incredibly persistent and without any clear triggers… I see. And have you noticed anything else happening at the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a little… tired, maybe? But honestly, who isn’t these days? I've been working long hours at the club, getting ready for the summer season. But no fever, no stomach trouble, nothing like that. Just… hiccups and a bit of weariness. Oh! And I did have a spicy meal on Monday, but I eat spicy food all the time and it’s never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Okay, long hours at the club, spicy meal… and tiredness. Alright. Now, let’s just go through a few general questions, just to be thorough. Have you had any issues with heartburn or indigestion recently?
PATIENT: Heartburn… hmm. Not recently, no. I used to get it a bit, years ago, when I was younger. But I changed my diet and it stopped. Nothing for a long, long time. Maybe a tiny bit of indigestion now and then, but nothing I’d even mention. Definitely nothing that feels connected to these hiccups. It’s just… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a thing. I try to stay away from them if I can, honestly. Just a bit of chamomile tea sometimes to help me sleep, but that’s it. I’m usually pretty healthy, all things considered. These hiccups are just… so unusual for me. It's worrying, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ivette. It is unusual for hiccups to persist this long without any obvious cause. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Exam sounds good. Significant medical problems… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s probably the biggest thing. And I broke my arm a few years ago, but it healed fine. Nothing else really. No asthma, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve been lucky, mostly. Just… these darn hiccups! It feels like they’re going to last forever.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal as a teenager, broken arm… good to know. Alright, now, before we move to the physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, sir. None at all. I’ve eaten all sorts of things, and I’ve never had a reaction. I'm pretty good in that respect, too. Really, I’m a very straightforward case, usually. These hiccups are throwing me for a loop! It’s just… persistent. And annoying. And I'm starting to feel a bit silly coming in for hiccups, honestly.
DOCTOR: Don't feel silly at all, Ivette. Persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, and it’s always best to get them checked out, especially when they’ve been going on this long. Alright, let's do a quick exam. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Lie down, you say? No problem at all. Hopefully this won't take long. It's just… these hiccups keep interrupting my thoughts! Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit frazzled.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, we’ll get through this. I just want to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It's a pretty quick process. Take a nice, deep breath for me, please. In… and out. Good. Your breathing sounds clear, that's a good sign. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds regular. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful.
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Alright. And… yes, that's fine. No, nothing painful. A little… sensitive, maybe, on the right side, but I often feel that. Probably just… normal digestion. I ate a pretty big lunch. Really, I don’t think there’s anything much to it. But thank you for checking, Dr. Smetak. It’s good to know it's not something serious. And… hic! There it is again. Just to keep things interesting.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little tenderness on the right side, likely related to digestion, and hiccups persisting. Your abdomen doesn’t feel particularly rigid or inflamed, which is reassuring. Given the history and the physical exam, it's unlikely there's anything serious going on. However, hiccups lasting over 48 hours do warrant some investigation, just to be safe. I'd like to order a basic blood work panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Also, since you mentioned a spicy meal, we can also look at a liver function test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, actually. Blood work, liver function… if it puts my mind at ease, then absolutely. It’s just… it’s such a nuisance, this whole thing. I'm just hoping it's not something major. And… hic! Excuse me. It’s like my body is deliberately mocking me. So, blood work then. Do I need a referral for that, or can I just come back here? And is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything at all? Perhaps avoid spicy food completely?
DOCTOR: Alright. No, you don't need a referral. We can do the blood work right here at the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition form. As for what you can do in the meantime, avoiding spicy foods is a good idea. Also, try drinking water slowly – sipping it instead of gulping it down. Sometimes that helps. And try some deep, slow breathing exercises. We can even look up some online resources for those, if you’d like. I’m also going to prescribe a medication called Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant sometimes used to treat persistent hiccups. We'll start with a low dose and see if that helps. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, actually. Water, breathing exercises, Baclofen… I appreciate you taking it so seriously. It's easy to dismiss hiccups, I know, but it’s been really disruptive. I’ll go get the blood work done right away, and I’ll pick up the prescription afterwards. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any side effects I should watch out for with the Baclofen? And… hic! Just for good measure, I suppose. Thank you, Dr. Smetak. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. Baclofen can sometimes cause drowsiness, dizziness, or muscle weakness. If you experience any of those, stop taking the medication and contact me right away. Also, avoid operating heavy machinery or driving until you know how it affects you. I’ll also give you a handout with detailed information about the medication. And if the hiccups don't improve within a week, or if they get worse, please don’t hesitate to contact me. We might need to consider further investigation, like an endoscopy, but let’s see how the Baclofen works first. Please feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Okay, drowsiness, dizziness, muscle weakness… and call if they worsen. I've made a note of everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Smetak. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I'll get the blood work done and pick up the prescription, and I’ll let you know how it goes. Hopefully, this will be the end of my hiccup saga! Hic! Oh, well. We can hope. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I hope so too! Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
