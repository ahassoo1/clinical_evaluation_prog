DOCTOR: Alright. So, Ms. Wrye, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, yes. Right. It’s about a letter. For… a pet. A little one. I need a letter saying I can have one, you see. The building management… they’re being difficult. Honestly, some people just don’t understand. It’s not like it’s a big animal. Though, to be fair, I can’t quite remember what kind of pet it is exactly… it's small and fluffy, I think?
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet. Right. And you’re saying building management requires medical documentation for…pet ownership?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! They said something about… allergies? Or maybe… emotional support? Honestly, all this paperwork. It's ridiculous, really. I just want to get a little companion. It's good for the soul, isn't it? I mean, surely they understand that. Though, I don't recall why I need a doctor's note specifically… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Normal isn’t necessarily the word. It’s… unusual. Building management typically requires documentation for reasonable accommodations. Are you claiming a medical need for this…companion animal?
PATIENT: A… medical need? Oh, goodness. I hadn't thought of it like that. I just… felt like I needed something. To keep me company. Being divorced and all… it gets lonely, you know? But a need… hmm. Is that what they’re asking for? I suppose I could say it helps with the loneliness. Does that count? I just… I really want this pet. It's a tiny thing, truly. Not a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, you are requesting a letter stating that owning a pet is medically necessary to alleviate feelings of loneliness related to your divorce?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's… that's putting it nicely, yes. Precisely. Alleviate… that's a good word. It really does help. Though, I don’t… I don’t have any official diagnosis for loneliness, if that’s what you mean. I just… feel it, you know? It's a very real feeling. Is that going to be a problem? I really don't understand all this medical talk.
DOCTOR: A diagnosis is typically required for medical accommodations, Ms. Wrye. We can’t simply write a letter stating a subjective feeling warrants a medical exception. Do you have any underlying conditions – anxiety, depression, perhaps – that might contribute to these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don’t know. I haven't really been to the doctor much, if I'm honest. Just for check-ups, mostly. And I think… maybe a bad back once? But that's been years. Honestly, I just wanted a little furry friend. I didn’t realize it was going to be this complicated. Is it… is it possible to just get a letter saying I’m a responsible pet owner? Surely that would be enough. I’m a very tidy person, you know. I’d never let it make a mess.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, a letter attesting to your tidiness is unlikely to satisfy building management’s requirements. They are concerned about potential allergens and liability. We are a medical practice, not a character reference service. Do you have a primary care physician we could contact?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Well, no. Not anymore. He… he retired, actually. Moved to Florida, I think. And honestly, I’ve been putting off finding a new one. Too much bother, you know? Everything’s so… complicated these days. So, you’re saying you can’t write the letter? Not even a little one? I just… it's a small pet. Really. It won't bother anyone. It's not like I want a horse! I… I don’t know what I’m going to do. This is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, writing a letter without a legitimate medical basis would be unethical and potentially harmful. It could set a precedent and create issues for other residents. I’m not able to fulfill your request. Perhaps you should consult with a licensed therapist. They might be able to provide documentation if appropriate. Otherwise, I suggest you speak with building management directly about your concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Well, no. I suppose not. That’s… terribly disappointing. I just thought it would be a simple thing. A little letter. It's just… a companion. Fine. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I… I suppose I’ll have to figure something else out. .
