DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… it’s probably nothing, honestly. But my family… we have a history, you know? My mom’s side… a lot of… problems. I just want to make sure I’m okay. Get it checked out, just for peace of mind. I'm Blain, by the way.
DOCTOR: Of course, Blain. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of concern. It’s good you’re thinking about this. “Problems” is a little vague, though. Could you tell me more about what those problems are on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s… complicated. Lots of heart stuff, mainly. And… some cancers. My aunt had… well, had a really bad one. And my grandfather… he basically just… faded away. Doctors never really figured it out, to be honest. It wasn't quick, but it wasn't good. It's just… it's always something. I don’t even really know what to ask about, you know? It’s not like I’m a doctor. I just… want to make sure I don't end up the same way.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Blain. It can be overwhelming trying to sort through family medical history, especially when details are unclear. It's good you're aware of it, though. Knowing about these things helps us focus our attention. “Heart stuff” and “cancer” are broad, but we can definitely start there. To get a better picture, could you tell me if anyone on your mother’s side was diagnosed with specific heart conditions – like high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, or arrhythmia?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not that I know of. My mom didn’t… she wasn’t one for going to doctors unless absolutely necessary. She always said they just try to scare you into taking pills. And my aunt… she was diagnosed pretty late. I don't think they ever really specified what kind of cancer it was, just… stage four and… bad. Look, I’m not a medical historian, okay? It was a long time ago and nobody really talks about it much. I just know it wasn’t good. Is that helpful? Because frankly, I'm starting to feel like I’m wasting my time trying to remember things people didn't even bother telling anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Blain. It's common for families to not have detailed medical records, and it's understandable that it’s frustrating to try and piece things together. It’s not a waste of time – you're being proactive, which is excellent. And the fact that you know there's a history of heart problems and cancer gives us a starting point. Let’s shift focus to you then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… the usual childhood stuff. Chickenpox, strep throat… nothing serious. I broke my arm once, but that's about it. I'm pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well, I exercise… I don’t really have any habits that would cause problems, if you know what I mean. That’s probably why this whole thing is so… annoying. I’m perfectly fine, and I'm sitting here worrying about things that probably aren't going to happen. I’m 24, for goodness sake.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Blain. It's excellent that you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. It's very common to worry about family history, and it’s responsible of you to address it, even at 24. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, but everyone does, right? And… oh! I had a reaction to some bug bite when I was a kid. Swelled up pretty bad. They gave me Benadryl. But other than that… no. Nothing serious. I’m not the allergic type. I can eat anything, take most pills… I’m pretty robust, honestly.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And you said you take most pills without issue. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nope. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. I figure if I can avoid it, I will. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And that's only when I remember. Honestly, I pride myself on not needing medication. I think a lot of doctors just want to push pills on people these days. It's a whole industry, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Blain. It’s good to be mindful of medication use. Alright, since you’re not currently taking any medications and have no known allergies, let’s move on to a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It'll help us get a baseline and see if everything is as you describe. We can check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, honestly? I was hoping to avoid all that. I came here because of the history, not because I think I’m sick. But… fine. If you insist. It’s just… I have a very important meeting this afternoon, and I don’t have time for… a lot of poking and prodding. Just… please be quick, okay? And try not to tell me everything that could possibly go wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Blain. I understand your concerns and will be as efficient as possible. This will be a fairly standard exam, and I’ll certainly keep your meeting in mind. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Fine. But if this takes longer than ten minutes, I'm leaving. And you can bill my insurance, whatever. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm. Deep breaths. 140 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not concerningly so at this moment. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… excellent. Good, steady rhythm. No murmurs or unusual sounds detected. Lungs are clear. Now, I’ll quickly check your pulse… 72 and regular. And just a quick look in your ears… everything appears normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything seems as you described – healthy. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation, especially with your family history. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: "Unremarkable." That's what I thought. See? Perfectly fine. And slightly elevated blood pressure? That could be anything! Stress, caffeine, the fact that I just had to sit here and have my blood pressure taken… Honestly, I told you it was a waste of time. What are you going to do now? Give me a million pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Blain. It’s good that everything appears normal, and it's likely the blood pressure is a temporary elevation. However, because of your family history of heart problems, it's best to be proactive. I’m not going to prescribe any medication at this time. Instead, I recommend a few simple blood tests to get a baseline assessment of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. This will help us rule out any underlying issues and provide a more comprehensive picture of your health. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications – like diet and exercise – to help manage your blood pressure. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. But I'm not changing my diet. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. And I exercise when I can. I don't have time for a whole lifestyle overhaul because some doctor thinks my blood pressure was a little high. Just… get it over with. How long will these tests take? And can I get the results quickly? I have a meeting, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll proceed with the blood tests, and I respect your commitment to your current lifestyle. The tests themselves should only take about 15-20 minutes. The lab is just down the hall; I’ll have the nurse draw the samples. Results typically take 2-3 business days to come back, but I’ll ask them to prioritize yours, given your meeting. While we’re waiting, I can provide you with some educational materials on heart health and healthy blood pressure levels, even if you’re not planning on making any changes right now. It’s always good to be informed. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Educational materials. Whatever. Just… get me to the lab. The sooner this is over, the better. And don’t bother calling me about every little thing. I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Blain. The nurse is ready for you just around the corner. Here's a requisition form for the lab. Please give it to her, and she’ll take care of everything. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today.
