DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. It’s been troublesome. Specifically when I’m trying to lie down. It feels… difficult. Like there’s a weight on my chest. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don’t mind. I haven't got all day, you understand.
DOCTOR: Breathing trouble, especially when lying down… right. A weight on the chest, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it. A weight. Not painful, exactly, just… pressing. It makes it hard to get comfortable. And then I can't sleep. It started… oh, maybe a month ago? It’s been getting a little worse each week, I think.
DOCTOR: A month ago, gradually worsening… Okay. And is this trouble breathing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly when I’m lying flat. If I sit up, or even use a couple of pillows… it’s better. Not gone entirely, but much better. So it’s definitely related to being… horizontal. I don’t have trouble walking around, or anything like that. Just lying down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, it's positional – worse when lying flat. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Maribeth?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… well, I do get a little bit of swelling in my ankles sometimes. Not always, but… when it’s hot like this, definitely. And… oh! My feet feel cold sometimes, even when the rest of me isn’t. Is that important? I don’t know if it’s connected. I just thought I’d mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle swelling, especially with the heat, and cold feet… Those could be related. Any coughing or wheezing?
PATIENT: No coughing. And no, I haven’t been wheezing. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I haven’t been short of breath when I’m doing things, just… when I try to relax and lie down. It’s very frustrating, honestly. I used to be able to sleep like a log.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any chest pain, palpitations – feeling like your heart is racing or skipping – or dizziness with this?
PATIENT: No chest pain, no. And my heart feels… normal, I suppose. It hasn't been racing. And no dizziness, either. No, not at all. I did feel a bit tired lately, but that could just be my age, you know? I’m seventy-one, after all. I don't bounce like I used to.
DOCTOR: No chest pain, no palpitations, no dizziness. Just fatigue, potentially age-related… Now, Maribeth, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed, oh, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? And… arthritis in my hands. Nothing major. I take some pills for it. Otherwise… no, I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I've always been a bit particular about my diet, you know. Mostly vegetables. Now, are we getting somewhere? I really need to get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and arthritis in your hands… anything else?
PATIENT: No, that’s all. And I take a pill for high blood pressure, but that’s it. My doctor at the Pueblo clinic just checks it regularly. He's retired now, though. That's why I came to see you. I don't want to forget anything… let me think… oh! I had pneumonia, years ago. But I recovered completely. That was… maybe thirty years ago? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure medication, pneumonia thirty years ago... And do you have any family history of heart problems, lung issues, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had some trouble with her heart when she was older. She had to go to the hospital a couple of times. But she lived to be eighty-five, so… I don't know if that's relevant. And my father… he smoked his whole life. He had emphysema, I think. But I never smoked. Never touched a cigarette. Now, is this all you need to know? I’m starting to feel a little faint just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and emphysema. Alright, Maribeth. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a quick exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. But please be quick. I have tomatoes to stake. And I’m not very good with all this… poking and prodding. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Maribeth. Just a quick listen. Now, if you could just lie down on the table… and I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know when you're done. I don't like being flat on my back. It's… difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m hearing some… congestion in your lungs, and a slightly rapid heartbeat. Your blood pressure is a little elevated as well. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again. There's a bit of a murmur, but it's faint. And yes, there’s some swelling in your ankles. Now, just sit up slowly for me…
PATIENT: Well? What does it mean? Is it something serious? I have things to do, Doctor. I can't be ill. Tomatoes don't stake themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. Based on what I'm hearing, it sounds like you may have some early signs of heart failure. The congestion in your lungs, the swelling in your ankles, and the murmur… they all point in that direction. But it’s too early to say definitively. We need to do some further testing. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, and a blood test to check your kidney function and a protein called BNP which is elevated in heart failure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I don't like the sound of that at all. X-ray? Blood tests? I haven’t had those done in years. Alright, if you think it’s necessary. But please be quick about it. And can you explain what all this means? In plain English, please. I don’t understand medical jargon. Is it… will I have to stay in the hospital? I really need to get back to my garden. Tomatoes, you know. They’re very particular.
DOCTOR: Alright, Maribeth. Let me explain it as simply as possible. "Heart failure" doesn't mean your heart has stopped working. It means it's not pumping as efficiently as it should be. This can cause fluid to build up in your lungs and ankles, which is what we're seeing. The X-ray will help us see if there's fluid in your lungs, and the EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart. The blood test will give us more information about your kidney function and that protein I mentioned. As for hospitalization, it’s too early to say. We need the test results first. We'll see what they show, and then we can discuss your options. I want to get this sorted out for you, so you can get back to your garden and your tomatoes. Now, I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and schedule the X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood tests and X-rays… It's a bother, but I suppose if you think it’s necessary… Just please don’t keep me waiting too long. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I bruise easily. And… could I get a glass of water afterward? This is all very upsetting. Tomatoes… they need me. Let’s get it over with, then.
