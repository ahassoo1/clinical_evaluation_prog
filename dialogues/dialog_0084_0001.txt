DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Voytek. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. I am here about the smoking, you see. I wish to… cease. To stop. It has become… troublesome.
DOCTOR: Okay, troublesome. I understand. It's good you're taking this step, Mr. Knoch. It’s never too late to quit. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I began… oh, perhaps fifty years ago, when I was a young man in Lithuania. It was… common. Everyone smoked. Initially, just a few cigarettes a day. Then… with the stresses of life, it increased. Now… well, now it is… a pack and a half, perhaps two, a day. Mostly unfiltered. I know, I know. Not good. I have tried to stop before, a few times, but… it is difficult. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pack and a half to two a day, unfiltered, for fifty years. That’s a significant history. And you’ve tried to quit before, which is good to know – it shows you’re motivated. Can you tell me about those attempts?
PATIENT: Yes, well… the first time, perhaps twenty years ago, I simply… stopped. Cold turkey, as they say. It lasted… three days. The headaches… unbearable. Then the… irritability. My neighbor complained, quite loudly, I recall. After that, I attempted… patches. They… made me nauseous. And gave me strange dreams. I also tried those… chewing gums. They tasted like medicine, and did not satisfy the… craving. It is the hand-to-mouth habit, I believe, as much as the… nicotine. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Knoch. The hand-to-mouth habit is very common, and often overlooked. So, patches and gum didn’t work for you, and you experienced headaches and irritability with cold turkey. Okay. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, they ache. The doctor back home—in Lithuania, you understand—said it was arthritis. Nothing serious, he said. Just… old age. I also have… a bit of a cough. Not terrible, but… persistent. It has been going on for… oh, at least a year now. And… I occasionally have heartburn. Nothing I haven’t managed myself with… antacids. I am otherwise… relatively healthy, I believe. Though, I do tire easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, a year-long cough, occasional heartburn managed with antacids, and some fatigue. And you're 74 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Seventy-four, as of… February, I believe. The 14th. It seems… a long time ago now. Is the cough… concerning? Perhaps it is the smoking, of course. Everything is the smoking, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It very well could be the smoking, Mr. Knoch, and that’s what we need to figure out. A cough for a year does warrant a closer look, especially with your smoking history. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Then we can discuss some options for quitting and whether any further testing is needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Perfectly sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor Voytek. Please, proceed. I am prepared. Though… I confess, I do not enjoy examinations. It reminds me of… unpleasant childhood memories. But I understand it is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here for me. I'll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Okay, taking a deep breath for me… and again… Good. I do hear some… wheezing in your lungs, which is common with smoking. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. And your throat looks a bit irritated, no major redness or swelling. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, and your pulse is 88.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Is that… serious? I have never paid much attention to those numbers. My father… he also had high blood pressure, I recall. He did not take care of himself. Perhaps… it is hereditary. Does this mean I must… change my diet? I enjoy my… sausages. And dark bread. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention your father's history, Mr. Knoch, that’s helpful information. A blood pressure of 140/90 is slightly elevated, and with your family history, it’s something we should address. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to change everything drastically, but making some adjustments to your diet and lifestyle can certainly help. And yes, sausages are high in sodium and saturated fat, so limiting those would be beneficial. Now, let’s focus on quitting smoking. We've discussed patches and gum weren't effective for you. Have you considered any medications specifically for smoking cessation?
PATIENT: Medications? No, I have not. The doctor back home simply… suggested willpower. He was a very… stern man. I do not believe in… pills, generally. They always have… side effects, do they not? I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. Though, I do not know of any for… this particular affliction. Perhaps… herbal tea? Or… acupuncture?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're hesitant about medication and prefer natural remedies. I understand. Herbal tea and acupuncture are options some people find helpful, and we can certainly discuss those further. However, there are medications specifically designed to help with smoking cessation that have been proven effective and have manageable side effects for many people. One medication, bupropion, can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Another, varenicline, works on the receptors in the brain affected by nicotine. Both require a prescription. Before we decide, I want to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I believe… once, many years ago, I had a rash after taking an… antibiotic. A penicillin, I believe. It was… unpleasant. And… I sometimes get… indigestion after taking aspirin. But that is not… a true allergy, is it? Just… discomfort. Otherwise, no. I have never had a… serious reaction to any medication. Though, I try to avoid them whenever possible. My grandmother… she swore by… honey and lemon for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash with penicillin and indigestion with aspirin. So, a penicillin allergy – that's important to note. We will definitely avoid that. And the aspirin reaction is good to know. Given your history, and your preference for natural remedies, we could start with some non-pharmacological approaches. We can discuss behavioral therapy, support groups, and nicotine replacement therapy like lozenges or inhalers. However, with a smoking history as extensive as yours, it might be difficult to quit successfully without some medication. Before we proceed with either approach, I'd like to order a chest x-ray to get a baseline look at your lungs and rule out any other underlying conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A chest x-ray… yes, that sounds… prudent. A sensible precaution, I believe. If it will give you… peace of mind, then I am willing. I have had x-rays before, for my… knees. They did not reveal much, unfortunately. But… it cannot hurt, I suppose. So, yes. Proceed with the x-ray. And… tell me more about this… behavioral therapy. What does that entail, exactly? Will I have to… speak about my feelings? I am not… accustomed to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get an order for the chest x-ray. It’s a quick and painless procedure, and the results will help us determine the best course of action. As for behavioral therapy, it's essentially working with a therapist to identify your smoking triggers and develop coping mechanisms to manage them. It's not necessarily about delving into deep emotional issues, though it can involve exploring your feelings about smoking if you're comfortable with that. More often, it's about learning practical strategies to resist cravings and stay motivated. We can arrange for you to see a therapist who specializes in smoking cessation. They'll work with you individually or in a group setting. Would you be open to exploring that option?
PATIENT: A therapist… hmm. I am… hesitant. I have always been a… private person. I do not enjoy… discussing personal matters with strangers. But… if it is a specialist, perhaps… perhaps it would be… acceptable. A specialist who understands… this affliction. A group setting… that sounds… unpleasant. Too many… opinions, I imagine. Perhaps… individual sessions. Yes. Individual sessions, if possible. And… is there a cost involved? My insurance… is non-existent, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, individual sessions with a smoking cessation specialist. That sounds like a good starting point. Let me check with our billing department about the cost for individual sessions, and whether we have any programs available for patients without insurance. I’ll also see if we have any specialists who offer a sliding scale fee based on income. While I'm doing that, let's talk about some immediate steps you can take. Have you considered setting a quit date?
PATIENT: A quit date… yes. I have… considered it. Several times, over the years. But… I always found an excuse. A celebration. A stressful event. A… cold day. It always seemed… inappropriate. But… perhaps it is time. Perhaps… August 15th. The Feast of the Assumption. A… significant date, in my culture. A day for… new beginnings. Yes. August 15th. That sounds… resolute. Do I need to… prepare anything? Apart from… willpower?
DOCTOR: August 15th, the Feast of the Assumption - that's a meaningful date to choose, Mr. Knoch, and a good one for a fresh start. It's excellent you're thinking about it proactively. You don't need much to prepare besides willpower, as you said! But it’s helpful to remove all cigarettes, lighters, and ashtrays from your home and workplace. Also, let your family and friends know you’re quitting so they can offer support. And be prepared for cravings and withdrawal symptoms – they will happen, but they're temporary. I'm going to write down a prescription for a chest x-ray, and I’ll get some information about smoking cessation resources and therapists for you. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or a high fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Voytek. I believe… you have covered everything, quite thoroughly. I appreciate your… patience. And your… understanding. August 15th… it is settled, then. I shall… prepare. Remove the… offending objects. And… inform my neighbors. Though, they are… accustomed to my habit, I fear. Very well. Thank you again. I believe… that will be all. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. I’m glad I could help. It takes courage to make this decision, and I’m confident you can do it. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I wish you all the best on August 15th.
