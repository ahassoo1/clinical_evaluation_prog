DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, I just… wanted to get tested for, you know, the thing. HIV. I just figured it was a good idea. Better safe than sorry, right? Though, honestly, I doubt I even need to be here. My wife and I… we're careful. But Medicare covered it, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, HIV testing. A very sensible idea, Mr. Belan. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. And yes, Medicare does cover it, which is good. “Careful,” you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, careful. Like… we always use protection. And it’s just been the two of us, you know? No… extracurriculars. Look, I’m married, Doctor. It’s not exactly a wild life. I just thought… you hear things. Better to just get it checked, I suppose. It’s probably nothing, but… you can’t be too careful, can you? Especially these days.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. You’re right to think proactively. It's good you and your wife are being cautious. Just to be thorough – and this is standard procedure – could you tell me a little more about when you and your wife started being sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting into personal details? Really? Look, it was… a while ago. Ten years, maybe? Right after we got married, obviously. What difference does that even make? It’s not like I’ve been… gallivanting around. Honestly, I find these questions a bit… intrusive, Doctor. I came here for a test, not a life story review.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions seem intrusive, Mr. Belan. It’s just that knowing when you and your wife became sexually active helps us understand the timeline for potential exposure, and ensures we select the appropriate testing protocols. It’s not about judging, I assure you. It's purely medical information. But if you're uncomfortable… we can proceed without that detail. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Right. "Potential exposure." Like I said, it’s just the two of us. It’s… simple. Look, no allergies, no. Nothing. And I don’t really appreciate the implication. It’s like you’re suggesting… never mind. Just get on with the test, alright? I have things to do. This is taking far too long for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: <stage>I sigh softly, making another note on my tablet. I feel like I’m missing something crucial here… but what?
PATIENT: Okay, alright. Fine. What kind of test are we talking about here? Is it a blood test? A… swab? I really don't like needles, to be honest. Is there any way around that? And how long is this going to take? I really need to be home this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a blood test, Mr. Belan. Unfortunately, blood is the most reliable way to get accurate results for HIV. We can minimize discomfort as much as possible – a quick draw, a small bandage. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. The results will take about 20-30 minutes to process in the lab. While we wait, would you mind if I quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… honestly, it’s all a bit unnecessary, isn't it? I’m perfectly healthy. But whatever. Get it over with. Just… try to be quick, alright? And please, tell me if there's a reason to be concerned afterward. Like, will I feel sick? Will I need a tetanus shot? I hate needles, remember? A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice. No lectures, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Let’s start with your blood pressure. No, you won't need a tetanus shot. And no, you shouldn’t feel sick afterward – a little pinch, that’s all. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine. Honestly, all this fuss for something that’s probably nothing. You people always make such a big deal out of everything. Just… get it done, alright? And don’t poke me too hard. I bruise easily. Honestly, I barely even feel anything. I’m very stoic, you know. It’s a Nepalese thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, that's done. You were very brave, indeed. Just hold gentle pressure on that spot for a few minutes. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds normal so far. While we wait for the lab results, do you have any other concerns I should be aware of?
PATIENT: "Brave"? Please. It was a tiny prick. Honestly, you're making me sound ridiculous. And "normal"? Well, good. That's what I expected. No. No other concerns. Look, I just want to get this over with. Is it going to be much longer? My wife will be wondering where I am. And frankly, I have better things to do than sit around a doctor's office. It's a waste of my time, really.
DOCTOR: The lab technician said about ten more minutes, Mr. Belan. I understand your frustration – I apologize for the wait. While we wait, I’ll just document everything and prepare the discharge instructions. Is there anything specific you do for work or hobbies?
PATIENT: “Document everything”? More notes? Honestly. I’m a Compliance Officer. I make sure other people follow the rules. Irony, isn't it? And… hobbies? I like to read. History. Mostly. And I spend time with my wife. That's about it. No extreme sports. No… questionable activities. See? Perfectly normal. Just get the results, alright? I really don't see the point of all these questions. It's a waste of everyone's time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Just one moment... Here are your results. Negative for HIV antibodies. Everything came back clear.
PATIENT: Negative, huh? Well, good. I knew it. Honestly, I told you it was probably nothing. Waste of time, really. Can I go now? I have things to do. And… uh… thanks, I guess. Though, honestly, it wasn’t exactly a difficult diagnosis. Can I have a copy of those results for my records? Just in case. You never know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. Here you are. I’m glad to hear everything came back clear. And you are right to keep a copy for your records. No further action is needed at this time, but routine STI screening is recommended for all sexually active adults. Thank you for coming in today. If you have any concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Have a good day.
