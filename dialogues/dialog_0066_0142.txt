DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It's… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come on and off, and when they hit, I get all sweaty and my heart kinda races. It’s hard to explain, feels awful though. I don't really... remember exactly when they started, to be honest. Just kinda always been happening, I guess?
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go, with sweating and a racing heart… that definitely sounds unpleasant. And you said it's been happening for a while, without a clear start date?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s about right. A while. I wish I could be more specific. Things are a bit… fuzzy, you know? I just feel wiped out when they happen. Like I need to lie down in a dark room. It’s not… constant, thankfully. But when it does happen, it's pretty bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jaxston. It's okay if you don't have a precise timeline, we can work with what you do remember. When they happen, is there anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggers. Not really. I haven't noticed anything. Stress, maybe? Work's… work. It's not fun, if that makes sense. But I get headaches even when things are pretty calm. Food doesn’t seem to matter either. I drink coffee sometimes, but that doesn’t seem to be it, either. Honestly, it just feels random. Which is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Random headaches are definitely frustrating to figure out. Okay, so no clear triggers with stress, diet, or caffeine. How would you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It's… throbbing, usually. Like a really bad pressure, all over my head. Sometimes it feels like it’s behind my eyes. It’s not… a sharp pain, more of a dull ache that just builds. And like I said, that sweating and heart racing comes with it. It can last for hours, sometimes. Feels like a really bad flu, but without the other stuff, you know? No cough or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing, pressure all over, sometimes behind the eyes, lasting hours, with sweating and racing heart… that paints a pretty clear picture. Have you noticed any changes in your vision when these headaches start?
PATIENT: Vision… That’s a good question. Uh… sometimes things seem a little blurry. Not a lot blurry, just… not as sharp. And maybe a little… spotty? Like I’m seeing little… flashes of light or something. It doesn’t last long though, just when the headache's really bad. I figured it was just part of the headache, honestly. I didn’t really think much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and those little flashes of light with the headache are important to note. Have you had any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… sometimes, yeah. Not always, but definitely a few times. I don't usually actually throw up, though. Just feel really sick to my stomach. Like I might, but it doesn’t usually happen. And it usually goes away when the headache starts to ease up. I always keep a bottle of water nearby, just in case. It’s not the worst part, but it’s not pleasant, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea without vomiting. Let's switch gears a bit. Have you ever had headaches like this before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: That’s… tough to say. I've always gotten headaches, honestly. But these… these are different. Like, I used to just get regular tension headaches, you know? Like a band around my head. These are much worse. The sweating, the heart racing, the blurry vision… I’ve never had that with the other ones. So, yeah, I guess this is… new-ish. They’ve gotten worse over the last… few months, maybe? I’m really not good at keeping track of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had headaches before, but these are more severe and include new symptoms – the sweating, racing heart, blurry vision. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. I’m generally pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat okay, I get some exercise when I can. No asthma, no diabetes, nothing like that. My divorce was… rough, and I haven't really prioritized my health since. Sorry, that probably isn’t what you wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Jaxston. It's good to know. And it’s understandable, life throws things at you. Any past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. No hospital stays either. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast. That’s it. Pretty boring medical history, honestly. Just the headaches, and the divorce. Which I'm trying to put behind me. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, hospitalizations, or significant medical history besides the headaches and recent life stressor. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I’m aware of. I can take most things without any problems, I think. I’ve taken over-the-counter pain relievers for the headaches, ibuprofen and stuff, and haven’t had any reactions. I haven't tried anything stronger, though. Does penicillin count? I think my mom said something about being allergic when I was little, but I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy in the past, but uncertain. We'll make a note of that. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for the headaches, like I said. Nothing regularly. No vitamins, no prescriptions, nothing like that. I drink coffee, if that counts. I'm not much of a pill person, to be honest. I prefer to just tough it out, usually. Which probably isn't the best idea, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional ibuprofen, coffee. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your neurological function, and do a quick eye exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Sounds good, Doc. I'm ready when you are. I just hope you can figure out what's going on. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything seems pretty normal so far, but I did notice your heart rate is a bit fast and your pupils are reacting a little slowly. Your neck is also a little stiff. I'm going to check your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well. Do you know what your typical blood pressure is?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t. I’ve never really checked it before. Never felt the need, I guess. My dad always said he had high blood pressure, but I don’t know what that means exactly. Is that… bad? I feel a little lightheaded, now that you mention it. Could be the stress, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly elevated blood pressure, and you're feeling a little lightheaded. It could be stress, but we'll want to investigate this further. Based on what you've told me – the headaches with sweating and racing heart, the blurry vision, the slightly stiff neck, and now the elevated blood pressure – I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be a tension headache, but the associated symptoms are more concerning. It could also be a migraine with aura, but the elevated blood pressure is atypical. We also need to rule out other possibilities, such as a secondary headache caused by something else. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. I'd also like to get a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: CT scan and blood work… Sounds… intense. Is that really necessary? I'm not a fan of hospitals, or needles, or… scans. I just want the headaches to stop, I don’t want to find out everything else that’s wrong with me. But… if you think it's important, I guess. I just… I don’t have insurance, Doc. Is that going to be expensive? I’m not really in a position to afford a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Jaxston. It is a lot, and I wouldn’t order these tests if I didn’t feel they were necessary to figure out what’s going on. The CT scan will help us rule out anything serious, like an aneurysm or a tumor. The blood work will give us a baseline of your health and rule out any underlying conditions that could be contributing to your headaches. Regarding the cost, I know not having insurance is a significant concern. We do have a financial assistance program available, and we can also explore options for a payment plan. I’ll have my staff member, Sarah, speak with you after this appointment to discuss the costs and available options. We’ll do everything we can to make this affordable for you. In the meantime, to help alleviate your symptoms while we wait for the test results, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed, staying hydrated, and getting plenty of rest. If your headaches become severe, worsen suddenly, or are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, or weakness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… financial assistance… Sarah… that sounds… helpful. I appreciate that, Doc. I guess… yes. That sounds reasonable. I just want to feel normal again. I just want the headaches to stop. I’ll talk to Sarah, and… I’ll try to stay hydrated. And… I’ll keep an eye on things. Thank you. I think that's all I can say right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston. I understand. We'll get the process started for the tests, and Sarah will be in touch shortly. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we're here to help. We’ll figure this out together.
