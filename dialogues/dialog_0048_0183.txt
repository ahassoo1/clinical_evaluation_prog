DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Grumman, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Tired. Just… very tired. Not like, need a nap tired. Like… always tired. Even after sleep. It’s been… a long time now. Doctor Sink, yes? I read your name on the door. A long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sink. And you’re… experiencing persistent fatigue, you said?
PATIENT: Persistent… yes. That’s a good word. Better than just ‘tired.’ And it’s… well, the other doctor, he said something about my… insides. My liver, he called it. Said it wasn’t working right. That was… six months ago, maybe? I don’t remember the exact date. But it's been bothering me ever since. It feels… heavy. Sometimes. Like a rock in my belly.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Insides,” liver…right. And this “heaviness” – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I eat. Big meals, mostly. But even small things sometimes. And… it makes me not want to eat. Which, you know, makes me even more tired. It's a… circle. A bad circle. I used to like food. Ethiopian food, good food. Now… not so much. I lose my appetite. It’s… frustrating. I’m a thin man, as you can see. Always have been, but this is… different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite, heaviness after meals… and you mentioned this was six months ago when another doctor brought this to your attention. Do you recall what exactly he said about your liver?
PATIENT: He said… something about it being… swollen. Inflamed, he called it. And… something about enzymes. Numbers, he showed me numbers. I don't understand numbers. I just… nodded. He wanted me to… change what I eat. Less spice, he said. Less fat. But Ethiopian food needs spice. It's not the same without it. He also said something about… not drinking. I don’t drink much. Maybe a beer sometimes with friends. Not enough to make my insides bad, I thought.
DOCTOR: Enzymes… right. And you've made some dietary changes, but haven't been able to fully adhere to them due to cultural preferences. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes, my skin… itches. Not all over, just… here and there. And… my legs. They swell up sometimes, especially if I stand for a long time. Like balloons. And… I get tired of thinking about it, honestly. It’s just… a lot. I don't know if those things are important. Maybe it's just… old age. I'm not a young man, you know. 52 years.
DOCTOR: Itching, leg swelling… These could be related. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, then we’ll see what the lab work says. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Table? Yes, alright. It’s… a cold table. Not comfortable. You’ll poke and prod, yes? Like the other doctor. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But alright. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Okay. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen… is tender in the upper right quadrant. Not acutely painful, but definitely sensitive. I’m also noting some mild edema in your lower extremities. And your skin appears slightly jaundiced. Do you have any history of gallbladder problems?
PATIENT: Gallbladder? No. Never had trouble with my gallbladder. What is jaundice? You said… jaundice? Is that bad? My wife, she noticed my skin looked… funny. Said I was a little yellow. But I didn’t think much of it. I thought it was just the light. Is this serious, Doctor? You’re making me worry now.
DOCTOR: Jaundice is a yellowing of the skin and eyes, and it can indicate a problem with your liver. It's not ideal, but we need to run some tests to determine the cause. We'll start with a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I'm also going to order a coagulation panel. I’ll have the nurse draw blood now. We'll get the results back within a few days. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t take any medications. Just… sometimes, a little something for my back. When it hurts. But it’s just… a cream. From the drugstore. Nothing strong. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. Are these tests expensive? I have Medicare, but… you know. Sometimes they don’t cover everything. And my wife… she worries about the money.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover these basic tests. Don't worry about the cost right now. We need to figure out what’s going on first. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, I want you to avoid alcohol completely, and try to eat a bland diet. No fried foods, no spicy foods. Just… simple things. Any questions?
PATIENT: Simple things… Yes, one question. Will I feel better? That’s what my wife wants to know. Will these tests… fix me? I just want to feel… normal again. Like before. Before the tiredness, before the heaviness, before the yellow skin. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Mr. Grumman. We need the test results first. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll see what the labs show, and then we’ll discuss a treatment plan. The nurse will be with you shortly. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s all. Just… the tests. Thank you, Doctor. .
