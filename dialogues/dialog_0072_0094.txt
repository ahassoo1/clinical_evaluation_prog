DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I am Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello. Just… education. My husband said I should come. He thinks I don't… know things. About… body stuff. I don't really remember what he said exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of you to come in, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s quite common to have questions, and we're here to address those. When your husband says you "don't know things," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh. He just says I don't… take care of myself. He worries. A lot. It's… embarrassing. He thinks I should know what happens… down there. But I don't. Not really. It's not like he told me anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly discuss that. It's perfectly acceptable to feel uncomfortable or unsure about these things, and frankly, it’s his responsibility to communicate effectively with you. But let’s start with a general overview. Do you have any specific concerns you'd like to address, or are you hoping for a more… comprehensive explanation of female anatomy and physiology?
PATIENT: Comprehensive sounds… better, I guess. I don’t even know where to start. Like… what should I even be worried about? He gets mad if I ask too many questions, says I should just know. Is everything supposed to… hurt?
DOCTOR: It is entirely inappropriate for your husband to react that way, Ms. Fontanazza. It's crucial to have open communication, and asking questions is always acceptable, especially regarding your health. Now, let’s address your concerns. Pain is not a normal part of healthy sexual function or everyday life. There can be discomfort from time to time, but consistent or severe pain is a sign that something is wrong. To give you a comprehensive overview, we'll go through the basics of female anatomy and physiology, discuss common concerns, and talk about preventative care. Before we begin, though, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes. Married, remember? But… it's not… great. He rushes. And… sometimes it hurts. A little. But he says I’m being silly. He says it's supposed to feel… different for women.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Fontanazza, it is never okay for your spouse to dismiss your concerns or make you feel uncomfortable regarding your body or your sexual health. “Different” does not equate to pain. To better understand what’s happening, let's start with a brief medical history. Have you had a regular gynecological exam before?
PATIENT: No. Never. He said they… poke around. And it's embarrassing. He said it’s only for women who have… problems. And he said I don’t have problems. I haven't even seen a woman doctor before. Just… the man at the general clinic. For check-ups.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, that is… concerning. Regular gynecological exams are a vital part of preventative healthcare for women. They are not only for women with problems; they are for all women, to screen for potential issues and ensure your overall health. And it's perfectly understandable to feel apprehensive, but dismissing essential care based on your husband's opinions is not in your best interest. Before we proceed, let me assure you that you are in a safe and confidential environment. We can take things at your own pace. Now, let’s talk about your menstrual cycle. Are your periods regular?
PATIENT: Mostly. Sometimes they're… heavy. And sometimes they're late. But… it depends. On… stress, I guess. He says I worry too much. It makes them worse. I don’t keep track, if that matters. Too much bother.
DOCTOR: It's important to track your cycle, Ms. Fontanazza, even if just to get a general sense of its patterns. Irregular cycles can be caused by a number of factors, and it's helpful information to have. Let's move on to past medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I know of. I had the flu, once, a long time ago. And… a bad back. From working. But he says I just need to stand up straight. He thinks I exaggerate everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No. Never. I had all my teeth pulled when I was young, but that was at the dentist. He… got angry about them being bad, and made me go right away. That was scary. It hurt, and he didn’t even come with me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Fontanazza. That sounds like a difficult experience. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she was always sick. A lot of colds. And… sad. He didn’t like her, said she complained too much. He doesn’t talk about her. My father… he worked too hard, died when I was young. I don’t remember much about him. That's all I know, really. He doesn’t like to talk about family. It makes him uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's helpful, even with the limited information. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Never. He doesn’t allow it. Says it’s bad for your health, and he… controls everything. He worries a lot, you see. He says he’s protecting me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it sounds as though your husband is very… involved in your life. And while it’s good that he cares about your health, it’s important that you have autonomy and feel comfortable making your own choices. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. He gives me vitamins sometimes. From the… internet, I think. He says they're good for me, but I don’t really know what they are. He just tells me to take them. He… decides everything. It's easier just to do what he says.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it’s concerning to hear that your husband is prescribing medications without consulting a medical professional. And it’s even more concerning that you feel unable to make your own choices regarding your healthcare. Before we continue, I want to assure you that everything we discuss is confidential. And if you are feeling unsafe or controlled in any way, I am here to help. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Besides the vitamins, are you taking any other prescriptions or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: No. Just the vitamins. He says they’re all I need. He doesn't like me to go to doctors. He says they don't know anything. He... controls everything. He gets angry if I ask questions. I'm scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it sounds as though you are in a very difficult situation, and I am very concerned for your well-being. It is not okay for your husband to control your healthcare or make you feel scared. I strongly recommend that we discuss the possibility of contacting a domestic violence resource center. They can provide you with support and guidance, and help you to develop a safety plan. I also want to offer to perform a thorough physical exam, to assess your overall health and address any concerns you may have. Before we proceed with the exam, however, I need to ask you directly: are you currently experiencing any physical or emotional abuse from your husband?
PATIENT: Sometimes… he yells. And… he gets angry when I don’t do what he says. He says I’m being difficult. And… he controls everything. I’m… scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, thank you for sharing that with me. It takes incredible courage to speak about these things, and I want you to know that you are not alone. It sounds as though you are experiencing emotional abuse, and potentially controlling behavior. This is not your fault, and you deserve to be safe and respected. Before we proceed, I want to let you know that I am mandated to report any suspected domestic violence. This means that I am legally required to notify the authorities if I believe you are in immediate danger. However, I will do everything I can to protect your privacy and safety, and I will only make a report if it is necessary to ensure your well-being. Would you be comfortable with me contacting a domestic violence resource center on your behalf?
PATIENT: Yes… please. I… I don’t know what to do. I just want it to stop. He says it's because he loves me… but… this doesn't feel like love.
DOCTOR: You are incredibly brave for reaching out, Ms. Fontanazza. And you are right, this does not sound like love. True love is based on respect, trust, and equality. What you are experiencing is control, and it is not your fault. I'm calling a resource center now. They can offer you support, guidance, and a safe place to turn. They can help you develop a safety plan and connect you with other resources in the community. “Hello, my name is Dr. Hembrey. I am calling with a patient, Ms. Airam Fontanazza, who is experiencing domestic abuse and needs immediate support…”
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you… I… I don’t know what I would have done without you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. It takes incredible strength to reach out for help, and I am so proud of you. Remember, you are not alone, and you deserve to be safe and happy. The resource center representative is aware of your situation and will be reaching out to you shortly to schedule a confidential consultation. They can provide you with ongoing support and guidance, and help you develop a safety plan. Now, if you’re comfortable, I would like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and address any immediate medical concerns. We can take things at your own pace, and you can stop at any time. Would you like me to proceed with the exam?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. But… please… be gentle. I'm scared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. I will be as gentle as possible, and we will take things at your own pace. You can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I will explain everything as I go, and I will respect your boundaries. First, I’m just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. This will help me assess your overall cardiovascular health. Everything is looking normal so far, Ms. Fontanazza. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. This will help me identify any signs of infection or inflammation. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… nervous. My heart is beating fast.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Fontanazza. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous, especially given the circumstances. We can stop at any time if you need a break. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me assess your overall digestive health. Please let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: No… not usually. But… right there… it hurts a little. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for letting me know. It’s important that you tell me if you’re experiencing any pain or discomfort. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a dull ache. Sometimes it’s sharp, like a… cramp. And it… comes and goes. It's worse when I… when I’m stressed. Or… after I… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you may be experiencing pelvic pain, which can be caused by a number of factors. Now, I’m going to gently examine your pelvic region. This will help me identify any potential sources of pain. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your pelvic region?
PATIENT: Stop… please… it hurts. It's… too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Fontanazza, I'm stopping immediately. I'm so sorry. You are absolutely right to tell me that it's too much. We will stop the exam right now. Your comfort is my top priority. It sounds like you may be experiencing some trauma, and continuing the exam could be re-traumatizing. We can schedule a follow-up appointment with a specialist who is trained in trauma-informed care. For now, let's focus on getting you connected with the domestic violence resource center and ensuring your immediate safety. Do you feel safe enough to go home?
PATIENT: No… I don’t want to go home. He’ll be angry. He’ll… he’ll be worse.
DOCTOR: "Hello, this is Dr. Hembrey. I have a patient here, Ms. Airam Fontanazza, who is experiencing domestic abuse and does not feel safe returning home. We need immediate assistance…” They are arranging for a safe place for you to stay tonight, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like they have a shelter nearby that can provide you with ongoing support and guidance. They can also help you develop a safety plan and connect you with legal resources. You are not alone, Ms. Fontanazza. We are here to help you every step of the way. Do you have any immediate medical concerns that we need to address before you leave?
PATIENT: Just… please… keep me safe.
DOCTOR: You are safe now, Ms. Fontanazza. We will ensure your safety. I will stay with you until the resource center representative arrives. They are sending a representative to pick you up and transport you to the shelter. They can provide you with ongoing support and guidance, and help you develop a safety plan. They can also connect you with legal resources and other services. Do you have any questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you… you saved my life.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. It takes incredible strength to reach out for help, and I am so proud of you. You didn't save your own life, you're incredibly brave. I'm just glad I could be here to help. I will stay with you until they arrive and ensure you're safely in their care. You are not alone, Ms. Fontanazza. We are here to help you every step of the way. Remember, you are safe, you are strong, and you deserve a happy and healthy life. .
