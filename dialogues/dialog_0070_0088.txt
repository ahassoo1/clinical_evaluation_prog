DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I’ve been having this… ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s pretty annoying, to be honest. I just want to figure out what’s causing it, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Ringing in the ears, or tinnitus as we call it, can certainly be bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… it’s not constant, you know? Like, it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a high-pitched whine, other times it’s more of a… buzzing sound? It’s hard to explain. It’s definitely louder when it’s quiet, like at night when I’m trying to sleep. Does that make sense? I just… want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. The fact that it comes and goes, and the different types of sounds you’re hearing, are important details. And it being more noticeable at night is quite common. Now, when did you first notice this ringing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably about three months ago? Maybe a little longer. I remember noticing it first after a wedding I was working at. It was a really loud venue, lots of music and people yelling. I figured it was just from the noise, and it would go away. But it hasn't completely, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, and you recall it starting after exposure to loud noise at a wedding. That certainly raises a possibility. Have you experienced any hearing loss alongside the ringing, or any dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hearing seems okay. I haven’t noticed any trouble hearing people or anything. And no dizziness or feeling sick. My ears don’t feel full, just… ringing. It’s just… frustrating. I’m a waiter, so I need to be able to hear orders. I’m worried it’ll get worse.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially given your profession. It’s good you haven’t noticed any hearing loss, but tinnitus can sometimes be an early indicator, so we’ll want to investigate further. Do you regularly use any headphones or earbuds?
PATIENT: Yeah, I do. Not all the time, but when I’m cleaning at home, or travelling on the bus, I listen to music through earbuds. Probably a bit too loud sometimes, to be honest. Is that bad? I didn’t really think much of it before this started.
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Prolonged exposure to loud sounds, even through headphones, can contribute to tinnitus. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I got divorced a couple years ago and… things got a little hectic. Didn't really keep up with checkups as much as I should've. I haven't been sick with anything serious in years. I have private insurance, so I can get things checked if needed, thankfully. I’m pretty healthy, I think. Just… annoyed ears.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your general health and insurance. We will certainly get this checked out. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I'll have a Panadol if I have a headache, but that's it. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if there's something seriously wrong, or if it's something that will just go away on its own? I’ve got enough going on without needing to worry about this too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Dhanoa. It's good you're not taking any regular medications. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this tinnitus, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, including an otoscopic examination of your ears, and a basic hearing screening. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do. I just… want to figure this out, you know? I’m happy to go along with whatever tests you think are best. The sooner, the better, honestly. I’ve got a long shift tonight.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and I'll start with looking in your ears. Your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums look normal in appearance. No signs of infection or fluid build-up. Okay, this is just to check your ability to hear different tones at various frequencies. I'm going to put headphones on you, and you just need to indicate when you hear a sound. Your hearing seems within normal limits for most frequencies, although there is a slight dip at higher pitches. It’s subtle, but present. This aligns with the possibility of noise-induced hearing damage. It's not significant enough to explain all of your symptoms, but it's a factor to consider.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know, I guess. So it’s probably the loud music? Even though my hearing feels fine? What does that mean, exactly? Is there anything I can do about it? I really don't want to have to wear hearing aids already. I’m only 27!
DOCTOR: It’s good that your hearing feels fine, as complete deafness isn’t always present, particularly early on. The slight dip in the higher frequencies suggests some degree of noise-induced damage, and the tinnitus is a common symptom of that. It's often the first sign, and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll need hearing aids immediately. There are several things we can do. I’d like to order a formal audiogram – a more detailed hearing test – to get a better baseline and assess the extent of any damage. I’ll also refer you to an audiologist for evaluation and counseling on tinnitus management. In the meantime, it’s crucial to protect your ears from further noise exposure. That means using earplugs or earmuffs in loud environments, and keeping the volume down on headphones. Have you ever used ear protection?
PATIENT: No, never really. I mean, I've been to concerts before, but I didn't really think about it. Just… turned up the volume a bit louder to hear over the crowd, you know? I always thought a bit of ringing after a concert was normal. I just figured it went away. I can definitely try to be more careful, though. I don’t want this to get any worse. So, the hearing test and see a specialist… and earplugs. Is that all? How long until I can get the hearing test done? And… how much will it cost?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good summary. Hearing test and a consultation with an audiologist, and proactive ear protection. I’ll write you a referral for the audiologist today, and a lab requisition for the hearing test. They have appointments available next week, I’ll have my assistant call and schedule it for you. As for the cost, the hearing test should be covered by your private insurance, although there may be a copay. I recommend checking with your insurance provider to confirm the exact amount. In the meantime, I also want to rule out any less common causes of tinnitus, such as a possible vitamin deficiency or a problem with the temporomandibular joint. I'll order a basic blood panel for those. Does that sound alright, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… thorough, which is good. Blood test, hearing test, see the specialist. As long as it’s covered by my insurance, I’m happy to do whatever it takes. Honestly, I'm just relieved you're not dismissing it as "just a bit of ringing." So… I guess I should go easy on the music for a bit, huh? And remember to wear earplugs… this is a lot to remember! Okay. Whatever needs to be done, just let me know. I’ve got a shift starting in a couple of hours, so I should probably go get this blood test done. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm glad I could address your concerns and provide a plan. It's better to investigate thoroughly and rule things out, and yes, minimizing noise exposure and using ear protection are key. My assistant will come in shortly with the requisitions for the blood test and the audiologist referral, and she can also answer any questions you have about scheduling or insurance coverage. For now, try not to worry too much. We've taken the first steps to identify the cause and manage your tinnitus. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… get me the paperwork, and I'll get it sorted. Thanks again, Doctor Abady. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Dhanoa. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope you feel better soon. My assistant will be right with you. .
