DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… Pavlovic, yes. Brodie Pavlovic. Well, it’s this cough. Been… a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t really hurt, just… bothersome. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it’s getting…old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right, a cough. “A while now” is…how long exactly, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a hard one. Seems like… a long time. Maybe… six months? Longer? It’s hard to keep track these days, you know. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It comes and goes. It started… around the winter, I think? When it got cold.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And has anything changed about the cough in that time?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm. Let me think. Not really, no. It's always just… dry. No… phlegm or anything. Sometimes it’s worse when I lie down, I think. Makes it harder to sleep. But other than that… no, pretty much the same. It just… is. Is that helpful, Doctor? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It's… something. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Like…? I get tired easily, I suppose. But I’m ninety years old, Doctor! I should be tired. Is that what you mean? No fevers, no… I don’t think so. Just… old. And this cough. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any shortness of breath with activity?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Not really, no. I don’t do much activity these days, to be honest. Mostly just sit and watch TV. But when I walk to the mailbox… no, I don’t get breathless. Maybe a little winded, but that’s just because I’m old, like I said. Is that… bad? Should I be breathless? I don’t know what I’m supposed to feel these days.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your past medical history, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Past medical…? Oh dear. That’s… a long list. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. They fixed it, I think. And my knees are bad, very bad. Arthritis, the doctor said. But other than that… honestly, I don't remember. It was so long ago. I’ve been to doctors, of course, but I don’t remember what they told me. My wife used to keep track of all that. She’s… gone now. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I think I had a hernia fixed, a long time ago. Maybe? It was so long ago, everything blurs together. And I had a… a knee replacement. Yes, definitely a knee replacement. On this one. That was… a good while ago, though. I don't remember exactly when. Sorry. It's just… hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: And what about family history, Mr. Pavlovic?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, that’s… complicated. I come from a big family. Lots of brothers and sisters. My mother… she had heart problems. And my father… I think he had… something with his lungs. But I’m not sure. They’re all gone now, Doctor. I was the youngest. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about their illnesses, to be honest. It’s all… very faded. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… Not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication lately. My wife used to handle all that. She always made sure I didn’t take anything I shouldn’t. I think… I might have reacted to something once, a long time ago. But I don’t remember what it was. It wasn't serious, I think. Just a little… rash. I really don’t know, Doctor. I’m sorry. My memory is just… not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen saturation. Please take a deep breath for me when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. Deep breath, you say? I can do that. I think. Just… be gentle, please. My chest gets a little… sore sometimes. And if I forget something, please just tell me. It’s hard to keep track of things these days. Whenever you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Hmm. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is… acceptable. I hear some diminished breath sounds, especially on the lower lobes. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Your heart rate is regular, but a little slow. No acute distress noted. Overall, your exam is… unremarkable, given your age. However, the diminished breath sounds are concerning. I'd like to get a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pneumonia or other lung issues.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray…? Oh dear. Is something… wrong? Pneumonia? I haven’t been feeling sick, exactly. Just this cough. Is it serious, Doctor? I don’t like… hospitals and things. And X-rays… they’re not very comfortable, are they? Do we have to do an X-ray? Maybe it’s just… old age? Like I said, I’m ninety years old. Perhaps it's nothing to worry about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, it's standard procedure to investigate a persistent cough, especially given your diminished breath sounds. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to rule out anything concerning. Pneumonia can be serious at your age, but it’s treatable if caught early. The X-ray is quick and relatively painless. It’s better to be safe than sorry, and I want to ensure there isn't something more serious going on. We'll need to get this done to proceed. I can write you a referral to the imaging center down the street. They're very efficient.
PATIENT: Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don’t want to cause any trouble. But I really don’t like hospitals and things. And I’m not very good at remembering things these days, so I hope I don't forget the appointment. Will you… write down the address and the phone number for me, please? And maybe… the time? I’m afraid I’ll just get confused otherwise. And is there anything I need to… do before the X-ray? Take off my hearing aids or something? I just want to make sure I do it right. I don't want to have to come back again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you are. The address is 123 Main Street, and the phone number is 555-1212. Your appointment is scheduled for tomorrow at 10:00 AM. No need to fast, and you can leave your hearing aids on. Just let the technician know about your age and any difficulties you may have. They will assist you. Now, while we wait for the X-ray results, I'm going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It won’t cure the cough, but it should make you more comfortable. It's just a temporary measure until we know what's going on.
PATIENT: 123 Main Street… 555-1212… Tomorrow at 10:00 AM… Okay, I think I have it. Thank you, Doctor. A cough suppressant, you say? That sounds… good. Anything to get a little relief. Will this cough suppressant… interact with any of my other medicines? I take something for my knees, I think… and maybe something for my heart? I'm not very good at remembering things these days, I'm afraid. It's just hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, I do not have a record of any medications you are currently taking. That is why it is important for you to provide me with a complete list of everything you take, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. This cough suppressant is very mild and unlikely to interact with anything, but to be absolutely certain, I need a complete medication list. Perhaps a family member can assist you with this?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re right, Doctor. I should have told you. I… I don’t really keep track of things anymore. My wife used to handle all that. She’s gone now. I don’t think I’m taking anything else. Maybe just a little something for my knees, but I honestly don’t remember what it’s called. It’s a small white pill, I think. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… hard to remember things these days. I don't want to bother anyone, either. My children are very busy. I don't want to trouble them. Perhaps… perhaps we should just proceed with caution? Just be extra careful? I really don't want to cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. In that case, we will proceed with caution. I will prescribe you a low dose of the cough suppressant. If you experience any unusual side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, or changes in your heart rate, stop taking the medication immediately and contact my office. I strongly advise you to try and obtain a complete medication list. Even a small white pill can have interactions. It's better to be safe than sorry. We'll monitor you closely. Here’s the prescription for the cough suppressant. And remember, schedule your X-ray for tomorrow at 10:00 AM. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Okay… low dose… stop if I feel unwell… X-ray tomorrow at 10:00 AM… I think I have it. Thank you, Doctor. No… I don’t think so. I think that’s all. Just… thank you for seeing me. And thank you for being patient with me. It’s just… hard to keep track of things these days. I'll try my best to remember everything. And I'll schedule that X-ray. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Get some rest, and we'll see what the X-ray shows. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
