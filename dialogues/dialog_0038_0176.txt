DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now. It’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups for more than two days. That is quite persistent. And frustrating, I imagine. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, you have no idea. It’s… well, they come and go, but mostly come. They don’t really have a pattern, not that I've noticed. I eat, I hiccup. I sit, I hiccup. I try to drink water… you guessed it, I hiccup. It’s just… random. I haven’t done anything different lately, not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Right, so pretty constant, regardless of what you’re doing. And you haven't changed anything in your routine recently – no new foods, drinks, or activities?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Same as always, really. I manage a small entertainment place downtown – a sort of cafe with live music. Lots of talking, a bit of running around, making sure everyone's happy… Usual stuff. I did have a slightly bigger coffee than usual yesterday morning, but that's about it. And I drink coffee every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a bit of a busy job, and a slightly larger coffee… That's good to know. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… getting excited, maybe? Like, if someone tells a funny story, or if something good happens at the cafe, it seems to trigger them. But honestly, Doctor, they just seem to happen anyway. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the usual tricks, but nothing works. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Right, so excitement seems to be a trigger, but they happen spontaneously too. And the usual home remedies haven't been effective. Okay. Have you had hiccups that lasted this long before?
PATIENT: No, never. Usually, they just go away after a few minutes, maybe an hour at most. This is… new. It's just unsettling, you know? And people are starting to stare at the cafe! It's not exactly good for business when the manager is hiccuping constantly. I’m a bit worried something serious is going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're taking it seriously. We want to rule out anything concerning. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. Then we can talk about some possible causes and if we need any further investigation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I'm just… ready for them to stop. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie back for me, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Then I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Okay, everything seems normal so far. No obvious signs of anything concerning. Now, a few quick questions about any other symptoms… Have you had any heartburn, indigestion, or nausea along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, no heartburn or indigestion. And thankfully, no nausea. Just… the hiccups. It’s almost comical, if it wasn’t so annoying. I haven’t been able to eat properly for two days because every time I start, hiccup… well, you know. It doesn't hurt, just… disruptive. And tiring. I feel a bit weak, probably from not eating.
DOCTOR: Right, so no associated symptoms like heartburn or nausea, and you’re feeling a bit weak from lack of food. That’s helpful. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel perfectly healthy, apart from the hiccups. No fever, no cough, no sore throat… Just this… persistent annoyance. I did feel a bit stressed last week, organizing a special event at the cafe, but that was a week ago. Does stress cause hiccups?
DOCTOR: Yes, stress can absolutely be a trigger for hiccups. It can affect your diaphragm and your nervous system. It's also possible, though less common, that something is irritating the phrenic nerve, which controls the diaphragm. Given the persistence, and the fact that you haven’t been able to eat, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything else going on. Specifically, we'll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure out what's going on, then yes, please do. Blood tests are fine. I just want this to stop, you know? It's really disrupting my life. Where do I go to get those done?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll get those ordered right away. There's a lab just downstairs, room 12. I'll print you a requisition form with the instructions. You don't need to fast beforehand. Once the results are back – usually within 24 to 48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and eat small, frequent meals if you can tolerate them. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible, even if it’s just taking a few deep breaths when you feel anxious. Here's the form. Do you have any questions about the tests or the follow-up?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything. Just small meals, stay hydrated, manage stress and come back when the results are in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's reassuring to know we're trying to figure it out. I’ll go get those done right away. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could reassure you, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. And feel free to stop by if the hiccups worsen significantly. Take care, and hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. .
