DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness... well, it’s been… a bit of everything, really. Mostly, I just haven't been feeling right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's been going on for… well, I can’t rightly say how long. A few weeks, maybe? It all sort of blends together these days. I do have that… you know… the sickness. They told me about it a while back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of feeling unwell with nausea and early fullness. And you mentioned "the sickness" – are you referring to a specific condition you were diagnosed with previously?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The sickness… the cancer. They found it… oh, it must be… five, maybe six years ago now? It was in my… well, somewhere inside. They gave me treatments, and I thought it was… under control. But now this nausea… it's making things hard. I don't remember the doctor explaining why this would be happening now. It's all a bit fuzzy. Do you… do you know what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. It's very common to have lingering effects or new symptoms arise after cancer treatment, even when things were initially stable. And it’s also understandable that details can become fuzzy with time. So, to clarify, you were treated for cancer approximately five to six years ago, and you're now experiencing new or worsening nausea and early fullness?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Nausea and feeling full really quickly. It's not a sharp pain, or anything. Just… uncomfortable. And it makes me not want to eat. Which is bad, I suppose, considering… well, everything. I used to love to cook, you know? For my husband, and my grandkids. Now… not so much. I just don't have the appetite. It's like… the joy's gone out of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life, and it's completely reasonable to feel frustrated and disheartened. It’s good you’re telling me about this. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Besides the nausea and early fullness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, what else… Oh! Sometimes I feel… tired. Really tired. More tired than usual, even for an old lady. And… I’ve been losing a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. But I haven’t weighed myself properly in ages. It’s hard to keep track of things, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful. Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are definitely things we need to investigate. And don't worry about forgetting things – it’s perfectly normal, and we'll take our time. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history, besides the cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My medical history… Well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, if I’m honest. I grew up on a farm, so I did a lot of physical work. No major illnesses, really. I had the usual childhood things, measles and mumps and such. And I had a bad fall a few years back and broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. My husband, bless his soul, had high blood pressure, but I never really had any trouble with that myself. I don’t… I don't think there's much else. I went to the doctor regularly for check-ups, but everything was always okay. Until… well, you know. Is that helpful? I’m sorry if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you were generally quite healthy before your cancer diagnosis. And no, you're not rambling at all. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… The doctor gave me something for the nausea after the treatments. A little white pill. I don’t remember the name of it, though. I think I stopped taking it a while ago because it didn’t seem to be doing much good. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. That's about it, I think. Just the vitamin D and… the one for the nausea that I don't take anymore. I used to take something for my arthritis, but that was years ago. It didn’t really help much, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were prescribed a medication for nausea after cancer treatment but discontinued it due to lack of effectiveness, and you currently take a vitamin D supplement. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her garden, and I was around a lot of pollen, but I never had any trouble with hay fever or anything like that. My husband was allergic to cats, but I love cats! I don’t have any pets now, though. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I hope that’s not a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies are helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history… well, what do you want to know? I was married to my husband for… goodness, almost sixty years. He passed away a few years back. It was hard. We raised three children, and they all have families of their own now. I have six grandkids and four great-grandkids. I used to be very active in the community. I volunteered at the local library and helped with the church bake sales. I don't get out as much these days, though. It’s hard to drive, and I don't have anyone to go with me very often. I mostly stay home and watch television. And… and I try to keep busy with my garden, when the weather is nice. Is that what you wanted to know? I hope I’m not boring you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Raymonde. Your life sounds very full and meaningful. It's good to hear about your family and your involvement in the community. Knowing this helps me understand the whole picture. Okay, now I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. This will help me get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I've always believed in listening to the doctors. Go right ahead. It's probably just something old age-related, but I suppose it's best to be sure. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take nice, deep breaths in and out for me. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. It’s not sharp pain, but it’s there. Blood pressure is 130/80. I'm also noting some mild weight loss based on your clothing fit. Do you know approximately how much weight you've lost recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tenderness… I suppose I hadn't really noticed. I've just been feeling… generally unwell. Weight loss… oh dear. That's probably more than I thought. Now, let me think... My daughter came to visit a few months ago, and she said I was looking thinner. Maybe… five, ten pounds? It's hard to say. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, like I used to. It just… slipped my mind. I suppose it's probably not a good sign, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Raymonde, weight loss is something we need to investigate further, especially given your history of cancer and current symptoms. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial physical exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and overall health. I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other abdominal organs. This will help us determine the cause of the tenderness and weight loss. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood work and an ultrasound… alright. Yes, let's do that. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? And hopefully, it's nothing too serious. It’s just… it’s hard to feel like you’re losing control. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure things out. So, yes. Let’s do the tests. Will you explain what I need to do? I sometimes forget things, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Raymonde. I understand completely. For the blood work, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. We'll draw a few vials of blood, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The lab is just down the hall, and the nurse will guide you through the process. For the ultrasound, you don’t need to fast, but you will need to drink a certain amount of water beforehand to get a better image. The technician will give you specific instructions when you schedule the appointment. It's a non-invasive test, and it usually takes about 30-45 minutes. I’ll have my nurse schedule both tests for you before you leave today. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Fasting for the blood work, drink water for the ultrasound… and your nurse will help me schedule everything. That sounds manageable. I just hope it's nothing too bad. But thank you for explaining it so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a bit, just knowing that we're taking steps to figure things out. It's a relief, really. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. That’s my job. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. We'll take things one step at a time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or jaundice , please contact the office immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. I really appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. Just knowing that you’re on the case gives me peace of mind. Thank you again for everything. I’ll let your nurse schedule those tests now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’m glad I could help. Have a good day, and we'll talk soon.
