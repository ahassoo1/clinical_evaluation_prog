DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… going to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s a bit of a bother, really. I don’t quite recall when it started, but it’s been… noticeable for some time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… Let me see. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… frequent. Both during the day and… well, at night as well. I find myself getting up a couple of times, perhaps three, during the night. It’s… unsettling. I don’t drink an excessive amount of fluids, I don’t think I do. Perhaps a couple of glasses of water with meals, and a bit of tea in the afternoon. Nothing remarkable, really. Is that helpful? I apologize if I’m being vague; my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It’s helpful to have any information you can recall. No need to apologize at all. So, frequent urination, both day and night, waking you up a couple of times per night. No pain associated with it. You don’t feel like you're drinking an unusually large amount of fluids. To get a better picture, could you estimate how often you’re urinating during the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. Let me think… During the day… perhaps every two or three hours? It varies, of course. Sometimes less, sometimes… a bit more. It’s not a constant, steady thing. I suppose it depends on what I'm doing. If I'm busy, I don’t notice it as much. But when I'm relaxing… that’s when it becomes… apparent. I’m truly sorry I can't give you a more precise answer. Numbers have never been my strong suit.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Verbos. An estimate is perfectly fine. So, roughly every two to three hours during the day, with some variation. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… No, I don’t believe so. It appears… normal, I suppose. The usual colour, nothing cloudy or… anything unusual. No blood, thankfully. I haven’t paid particularly close attention, if I’m honest. One doesn’t generally scrutinize one’s… output, does one? Is there something I should be looking for? I apologize again for my lack of detail. Perhaps a physical examination would be more… informative?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not lacking detail at all, Mr. Verbos. It's good you haven't noticed any blood or cloudiness. And yes, a physical exam would be a good next step. If you’d be comfortable, I’d like to listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. It will just take a few moments, and it will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical examination. Quite alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose the more information you have, the better. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just… let me know if anything feels… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Mr. Verbos, if you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I'll also be checking your reflexes and sensation. It's a fairly routine examination. Okay, breathe normally for me. I'm not hearing anything overtly concerning at this point, but I'm checking for any unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please cross your legs?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. It’s… rather cool in here, isn’t it? Not unpleasant, just… noticeable. I hope I’m not making this more difficult than it needs to be. I’m not particularly fond of medical examinations, I must confess. It brings back… unpleasant memories. But I understand it’s necessary. Proceed as you deem appropriate.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. I’ll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. And thank you for letting me know about the temperature; I’ll adjust the thermostat in a moment. Okay, everything seems neurologically intact. No obvious reflexes or sensation deficits. Your abdomen sounds normal as well. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam, it could be a number of things, Mr. Verbos. It could be something as simple as increased fluid intake, or perhaps a urinary tract infection. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, is an issue with your bladder or prostate. To help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, as a precaution. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample… Yes, certainly. That seems… reasonable. I suppose it's unavoidable, really. A PSA test as well? Is that… something to be concerned about? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I simply wish to understand what’s happening. I’ve always preferred to be informed, even if the news isn’t entirely pleasant. So, a urinalysis, a basic metabolic panel, and a PSA test. Lead the way, as it were. I shall endeavour to cooperate to the best of my ability.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It’s good you ask questions, and I’m happy to answer them. The PSA test is a routine screening for prostate health. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, it's just a precautionary measure given your age and symptoms. If you'll follow me, I have a private room where you can provide the urine sample. I’ll give you a sterile container and instructions once we're inside. It’s a fairly simple process. After that, we can return here, and I'll explain the next steps.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A private room, you say? Lead the way. I confess, I find these sorts of procedures… slightly undignified. But needs must, as they say. I shall endeavour to maintain my composure. A sterile container and instructions… I hope I haven’t forgotten how to… utilize such a device. It’s been some time since my last medical examination, I must confess. But I shall try my best. Thank you for your patience, Doctor.
