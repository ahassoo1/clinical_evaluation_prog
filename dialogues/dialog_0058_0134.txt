DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it's been my stomach, mostly. Feels queasy a lot, and I just don’t have much appetite anymore. I get full awful quick, even if I barely eat anything. It's been going on for a little while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, my memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Queasy” and loss of appetite… and getting full quickly. Right. And you said this has been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A little while… maybe a month or two? It's hard to say for certain. Things just…blur together these days. I do remember it started getting worse after…well, after the treatments. I had…some trouble, you know, with the cancer a while back. They said it was… I forget what they called it exactly. Something with my…insides.
DOCTOR: Okay. And these "treatments" were for…cancer?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They did…things. Chemotherapy, I think? And radiation. It was a good while ago now, though. Several years. I was feeling pretty good for a long time after, but this…this nausea started up again, and the not being hungry. It worries me some, to be honest. It's not like the side effects I had before, not exactly.
DOCTOR: Right, I see some records of chemotherapy and radiation for…stomach cancer, approximately five years ago. And you’re saying this is different than what you experienced during treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, very different. Back then, I knew why I felt sick, you know? It was the medicine, the doctor told me. This…this just comes and goes. And it’s not just the feeling sick to my stomach, either. It’s like…I don’t want to eat. Food just doesn’t appeal to me anymore. Even things I used to love. Is that…normal? I’m probably just worrying over nothing.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s not ideal. Loss of appetite can be a symptom of many things. Have you noticed any weight loss, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I…I haven’t really been weighing myself. I suppose I haven’t noticed my clothes feeling looser, but then again, I don't pay much attention to that sort of thing anymore. My daughter, Sarah, she probably knows. She comes by every week and checks on me. She’d notice if I was getting too thin, I’m sure. I haven’t been myself lately, though. Just…tired and not really caring about much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I've been a little more tired than usual, like I said. And…sometimes my stomach just hurts, a dull ache. Not awful, but noticeable. And…I haven't been sleeping as well, either. I wake up a lot during the night. Mostly just thinking, though. Old memories…things like that. It doesn’t really hurt to sleep, just…restless. Oh, and I’ve been a little bit……constipated, if you want to know. Is that too much information?
DOCTOR: No, it’s fine. Tiredness, stomach pain, trouble sleeping, constipation…Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood? I…I don’t think so. I haven’t really…looked, to be honest. I try not to think about things like that. I would remember, wouldn’t I? If there was blood… Sarah would probably say something, too. She always checks on me…but no, I don't think so. Not that I’ve seen. It's probably just my nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just have a quick listen and feel. Try to relax for me. Anything here tender?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little…sensitive. Right about there. Not awful pain, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, like I was saying. And…maybe a little bit here too. But that’s not as bad. It just…feels a little swollen, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. There's some mild tenderness in your upper abdomen, as you pointed out. It’s difficult to say exactly what this is without further investigation. Given your history of stomach cancer, it's important to rule out a recurrence or other possibilities. We'll need to run some blood work, and I'm going to order an upper endoscopy.
PATIENT: An endoscopy? Oh dear. What’s that involve? I don’t like the sound of that…Is it painful? And blood work is fine, I suppose. I get those done all the time with Medicare. But an endoscopy… What are we looking for, exactly? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining. It allows us to look for any abnormalities, such as inflammation, ulcers, or growths. It’s not usually overly painful; you’ll be sedated for the procedure. Given your previous cancer diagnosis, it's a necessary precaution. It allows us to get a definitive answer. We’ll be looking to rule out recurrence, assess the health of your stomach lining, and investigate the cause of your symptoms. I'm going to schedule that for you next week. And the blood work will be ordered today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Next week… I suppose so. If it has to be done. Sedated, you say? That’s…good. I don’t like the idea of being awake for all that. Do you think it could be…nothing serious? Just something I ate, maybe? I'm probably worrying over nothing, like always. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining it all. It just…scares me, you know? Cancer is a frightening word.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say without the results of the endoscopy. While it could be something benign, it's important to rule out more serious possibilities given your medical history. I'll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CEA level – that's a tumor marker. We'll get those results back quickly, and then we'll schedule the endoscopy. Try not to worry too much, Ms. Kelder. We're being proactive, and that’s the most important thing. I will have my nurse give you the pre-endoscopy instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very well. Pre-endoscopy instructions…yes, that’s good. I’ll need Sarah to help me with all of that. Thank you again for seeing me so quickly. I suppose I'll just…wait for the tests, then. Thank you. .
