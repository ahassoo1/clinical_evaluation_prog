DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's Velda Squiers, yes. Well, I'm going on a cruise next month, a lovely one around the Mediterranean, and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I depart. Just a form filled out by my doctor, you see. I thought it best to get that sorted now, rather than leave it to the last minute.
DOCTOR: A pre-cruise physical… yes, quite sensible. I remember those forms being… rather detailed. Alright. Let’s start with the basics, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, they are. Quite a few questions, actually. I do hope it won't be too much trouble. Where would you like to begin? Perhaps with my general health? I've been generally well, if you’re asking. Not a lot to report, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Right, generally well… good, good. Hmm. Let's see… any significant illnesses or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Now, that was… well, my husband, bless him, he was the one with the ailments, not me. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago, but that was all quite routine. And a broken wrist once, falling off a bicycle, but that healed up nicely. Aside from that, nothing significant, Doctor. I haven’t been hospitalised, and I’ve never had anything… serious.
DOCTOR: Tonsils as a child, broken wrist… Alright. And any surgeries besides those?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Just the tonsils and the wrist. Everything else has been… well, quite natural, if you understand me. I’ve always been fortunate with my health, I suppose. I’ve always tried to eat well and stay active, though I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea, mind you! But nothing that would require a surgeon, certainly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good, good. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, I might take a painkiller for a headache, a paracetamol, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and certainly nothing every day. I haven’t needed anything, thankfully. I pride myself on avoiding those sorts of things if I can.
DOCTOR: And… any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. Not to medications, food, or anything else, really. I've always been able to eat anything and everything put in front of me. And I've never had a reaction to any sort of treatment, thankfully. My mother always said I was a hardy child, and I suppose I still am. A bit of a sniffle now and then, like everyone else, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… alright. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother lived to a very good age, almost ninety, and she was remarkably healthy right up until the end. My father, though… he had a bit of trouble with his heart later in life, but I don’t know the specifics, truthfully. And my husband's side of the family... well, there was some talk of high blood pressure, I believe, but nothing concrete. I'm not terribly knowledgeable about medical history, I’m afraid. It wasn’t something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: Alright… heart trouble in your father, possible high blood pressure on your husband’s side. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would have had a fit! I’ve always considered smoking a dreadful habit. And my husband, bless him, he wasn’t a smoker either. We both enjoyed a good walk and a cup of tea, much more wholesome pursuits, you see. We were never around smoke, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. And… how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a wee dram occasionally, Doctor. At Christmas, perhaps, or with a special meal. I don't drink regularly, not at all. A glass of sherry with my biscuits sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing that would interfere with my health, I assure you. My husband enjoyed a pint with his friends, but I was never much of a drinker, truthfully. A social one, at most.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. Alright. And… what sort of work do you do, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: I’m a merchandise displayer and window trimmer, Doctor. I arrange things nicely in shops, make things look appealing, you see. It keeps me on my feet, which is good, and I enjoy being creative. I've been doing it for years now, ever since I left school. It’s not strenuous work, but it’s satisfying. I’m fairly active throughout the day, moving things around and climbing ladders – carefully, of course! It's a good job, keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Merchandise displayer... Alright. Now, let’s get some current information. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. That’s why I’m a little surprised to be here, to be honest. I feel perfectly well, thank you. Just wanting to get this form filled out for the cruise. I have my usual aches and pains, you know, being my age, but nothing that bothers me. No coughs, no colds, no fever, no anything. Perfectly fit and healthy, as far as I can tell. Just a bit of routine, really.
DOCTOR: Very good. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, things like that. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you think is necessary. I don't mind a bit of a check-up, even if I feel perfectly well. It's always good to be sure, isn’t it? You just let me know what I need to do. I’ll happily cooperate. Please, do go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just step over here and sit on the table, please. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. That’s a bit elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and another… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Just a slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you experience much stress?
PATIENT: Oh, well, now… not any more than most, I suppose, Doctor. My husband's passing was… difficult, of course, but that was a few years ago now. I’ve adjusted, thankfully. I wouldn't say I feel particularly stressed. I enjoy my work, and I have a few friends I see regularly. Mostly, I just keep busy. I suppose worrying about the cruise arrangements could be a little stressful, making sure everything is just right, but nothing major. Is that what you mean, Doctor? The cruise?
DOCTOR: Yes, the cruise arrangements, perhaps. Okay. Let’s just check your reflexes… And… can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Of course. There you are. As strong as I can manage, anyway! I still do a bit of gardening, you see. Keeps my hands in good working order. Is that alright? Are my reflexes… good? I always worry about those. My mother used to say her reflexes were quite slow in her old age. I hope mine aren't!
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip is good and reflexes are within normal limits. Everything appears to be quite normal, Ms. Squiers. Just the slightly elevated blood pressure. We should monitor that. Do you know your cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. I’ve never had my cholesterol levels checked, not once! I’m afraid I don’t know anything about those sorts of things. Is it something I should be concerned about? I suppose I should have asked about that years ago, but it never seemed… necessary. I eat fairly healthily, I always thought that would be enough. Are you saying I should get that checked?
DOCTOR: It would be prudent, yes. It's a good idea to have a baseline cholesterol check, especially given the slightly elevated blood pressure. We can order a simple blood test. That said, everything else appears to be good. Given your overall health and the fact that you feel well, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn't enjoy your cruise. I’ll fill out the form for you now. It just needs my signature and it’s all done. Do you have any further questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you so much. I’m very relieved to hear that I can enjoy my cruise without worry. The blood test sounds sensible, yes. Perhaps you could let me know how to arrange that? I don't usually bother with doctors, so I'm a bit unsure of the process. And, no, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I truly appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll print a requisition for the blood test, along with the address of the local lab. It’s just a standard lipid panel. You don’t need to fast, but avoiding alcohol for 24 hours beforehand is recommended. Here you are. The results will be sent directly to my office. We can discuss them during a follow-up appointment, if necessary. Do you have any other concerns, or shall we wrap this up?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect, Doctor. That's very helpful indeed. A lipid panel... I’ll remember that. And I’ll certainly avoid the alcohol. Thank you for being so clear. No, I think that’s all. I truly appreciate everything you’ve done. I feel much more confident about my cruise now. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. You've been most kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. Enjoy your cruise. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns after the blood test. Have a wonderful time, and safe travels.
