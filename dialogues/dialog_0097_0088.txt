DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Georgiou, good to meet you too. Um, it’s my ears. They’ve been ringing. It’s really annoying, to be honest. Been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears – that can be really disruptive, I understand. And you said “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe… a month or so? It comes and goes. Some days it's barely noticeable, others it’s like a high-pitched whine that just won’t stop. It makes it hard to concentrate, especially at work. I’m a waiter, so… lots of noise.
DOCTOR: Right, a waiter – that definitely explains the noise exposure. And it's been consistent for about a month, varying in intensity. Does it happen in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Just the left one, mostly. Sometimes I think I hear it a little in the right, but it’s not nearly as bad. It's definitely worse on my left side. I just want it to go away, you know? It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Constant ringing can be incredibly frustrating. Okay, so primarily in the left ear, varying intensity over the past month. Have you noticed anything that specifically makes it worse, besides the work noise?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Not really, not that I've noticed. Maybe if I’m really stressed? But I'm always a little stressed, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific. I haven’t been around any really loud machines or anything outside of work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific triggers identified other than potentially stress, and it's not related to any recent loud events. Have you experienced any hearing loss, dizziness, or any pain in either ear?
PATIENT: No pain, definitely not. And no dizziness either. I think my hearing’s okay… I haven't really noticed any difference, but I guess I haven't been actively testing it, you know? It's just the ringing that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. No pain or dizziness is good. Let's talk a little about your overall health. Have you had any ear infections recently or in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I remember. I had a few when I was a kid, I think, but nothing in the last… well, ever, as an adult. I don't get sick very often. Mostly just tired. And stressed. Sorry, I keep saying that.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize! Stress is a big factor in a lot of things. Okay, no recent ear infections. Any family history of hearing loss or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Um... that's a tough one. My dad's a bit hard of hearing, but he's pretty old, you know? I always figured it was just from getting old. I don’t think anyone else in the family has complained about ringing. I'm not really sure, to be honest. We don’t talk about health stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Father with age-related hearing loss, but no specific family history of tinnitus. And you mentioned being tired. Are you sleeping well?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I work long hours, and… things have been a bit difficult since the divorce. Just… a lot on my mind. I get maybe six hours a night, if I’m lucky. It's not restful sleep, either. I toss and turn a lot. Sorry, I'm rambling. I just want this ringing to stop.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Jaylyne. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot, and sleep deprivation can definitely contribute to stress and exacerbate symptoms. Okay, so we’ve got tinnitus primarily in the left ear, a month or so duration, no recent infections, family history of age-related hearing loss, and some sleep issues. Before we go further, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… paracetamol sometimes, for headaches. Nothing regularly. And I had some antibiotics a couple years ago for a chest infection, but that was a while ago. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol occasionally for headaches, antibiotics a couple of years ago. No regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I’m Fijian, we eat a lot of different things! I think if I was allergic to something, I’d know about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Jaylyne. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick exam of your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work later. Hopefully, you can figure out what's causing this ringing. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your ears. I’m going to look inside them to see if there’s any wax build-up or inflammation. It’ll just take a moment. Hmm… a little bit of cerumen, some wax, but nothing significant. And the right ear looks clear. No sign of any infection or fluid. Now, I'm going to listen to your hearing with this. Just let me know if you can hear the tone in each ear. It’s a simple test, and it will help me get a baseline.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just tell me when you want me to say something? I really hope it’s nothing serious. Work's hard enough without this noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, perfect. Alright, I'm going to start. When you hear a tone, just say “yes”. In the left ear… do you hear it?
PATIENT: Yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now… Do you hear that one?
PATIENT: Yes. I can hear it. It's a bit faint, but yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Jaylyne. That’s all for the quick hearing test. What I’m seeing is a slight decrease in hearing at higher frequencies in the left ear, which could be contributing to the tinnitus. It’s not dramatic, but it's worth noting. I also checked your nose and throat, and everything looks normal there. No signs of any infection or congestion.
PATIENT: Okay... so what does that mean? Is it serious? Will I have to take time off work? I really need this job. A slight decrease… does that mean it’s getting worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a breath. A slight decrease in hearing at higher frequencies is common, especially with noise exposure. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s getting dramatically worse, but it does explain why you might be experiencing tinnitus. It's like… when a radio isn't tuned perfectly, you get static. Your brain is essentially filling in the gaps. Regarding taking time off work, I don’t think that's necessary at this stage. The most likely cause of your tinnitus is noise-induced, and we can manage it without needing time away from your job. However, ignoring it isn’t the best approach. We’ll focus on protecting your hearing and strategies to manage the ringing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. So, it's not like a serious illness or something? Just… noise? I guess I figured that might be it, working in a restaurant. Protecting my hearing... what does that even mean? Can I wear earplugs at work? Would that look weird?
DOCTOR: Exactly, it's not a serious illness. It’s a very common symptom, and in your case, the most likely cause is noise exposure. And yes, absolutely, you can wear earplugs at work! It wouldn’t look weird at all. In fact, it’s a very responsible thing to do. There are special earplugs designed for musicians and waiters that filter out damaging frequencies but still allow you to hear conversations. They're pretty discreet. We can discuss that. To manage the ringing itself, there are a few things we can try. Sometimes, things like white noise or background music can help to mask the tinnitus. There are also apps designed to help with tinnitus management. We can also talk about stress reduction techniques, as stress can definitely exacerbate the problem. Would you be open to exploring those options?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Earplugs, I can definitely try that. And maybe the apps… anything’s worth a shot, right? Stress reduction… easier said than done, but I guess I should try. White noise… like a fan or something? I just want it to stop, you know? Is there anything… medicine or something I can take? Even if it's just to help me sleep?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. You want it to stop, and we're going to work towards that. There aren’t any medications specifically to cure tinnitus, unfortunately. However, we can address some of the related symptoms. If the tinnitus is disrupting your sleep, we can discuss some options for sleep aids. Something mild like melatonin might be helpful. There are also some medications that can help with anxiety and stress, which, as we’ve discussed, can make the tinnitus worse. But I generally prefer to start with non-pharmacological approaches like stress reduction techniques and improving sleep hygiene. Let’s start with those earplugs for work, and I’ll give you some information on tinnitus management apps and stress reduction techniques. I also want you to try to establish a regular sleep routine – going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, even on weekends. We can revisit the sleep aid options if that doesn’t improve things. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Earplugs, apps, sleep routine… I can definitely try that. And if it doesn’t work, we can talk about the sleep stuff. Okay. So, do I need to come back for a follow-up or something? And how long should I try this before… you know, seeing if it works?
DOCTOR: That's great. Commitment is half the battle. Yes, I'd like to see you for a follow-up in about six to eight weeks. That will give you enough time to implement those strategies and see if they make a difference. If your tinnitus gets significantly worse before then, or if you develop any other symptoms like hearing loss or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call the office sooner. In the meantime, I’ll give you some written information about tinnitus management and resources for stress reduction. I’m also happy to answer any questions you have before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. I feel a bit better knowing there’s something I can do about it. And that it's probably not something serious. Six to eight weeks, I’ll remember that. Thank you again, Dr. Georgiou.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Remember, consistency is key with these strategies. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s that information for you. Take care, and I'll see you in six to eight weeks. Have a good day. .
