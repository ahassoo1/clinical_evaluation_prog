DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, lately I does be feeling really thirsty, all the time. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just...not right, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Thirst and hunger, even after eating… okay. And how long have you been feeling this way, Bianca?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think now. It start…maybe about a month or so ago? Not sure exactly, but around that long. It getting worse each week, you know? I drink a lot more water now than before, and still feel dry. And I eating more too, but not gaining any weight. Just feel…empty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month, gradually getting worse. No weight gain despite increased appetite… That’s good information. Have you noticed any changes in how often you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Hmm… yes, come to think of it, I does go to the bathroom more often than usual. Especially at night, which is not good! I have to get up, you know? Two, maybe three times sometimes. It not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination, particularly at night… That's important. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, or any unusual fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Vision? No, no changes in my vision. I see alright, same as always. And I does feel a little tired sometimes, but that's just because I working, you know? I does operate the pumps all day. It hard work, and I old, so I expect to be tired. But it not more tired than usual, just…normal tired. No weakness or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, any skin changes, or any difficulty healing from cuts or bruises?
PATIENT: Weight loss…no, Doctor. I told you, I not gaining weight, but I haven't lost any either. Skin…no changes to my skin. Just the usual. And I does heal alright, I think. I cut my finger last week with a mango, and it stop hurting quick enough. Nothing special. I does be careful, you know? I don't like trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information. You mentioned you operate pumps… Is that a physically demanding job?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, very demanding. It heavy machinery, and I does be on my feet all day. Lots of lifting and checking the pressure. It not easy work for an old woman like me, but I does what I have to do. My husband, he helps when he can, but he not so strong anymore neither. We need the money, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Okay, Bianca. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, increased appetite without weight gain, and your physically demanding job – I'd like to do a quick blood sugar test. It will help us rule out a few things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood sugar test? Hmm… what does that involve, Doctor? I not scared of needles, but I like to know what going on, you know? Is it serious? Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple test, Bianca. We’ll just take a small sample of blood from your finger. It doesn’t hurt much at all. It helps us check your sugar levels. It’s a common test, and often helps us understand why you’re feeling so thirsty and hungry. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's best to check just to be sure. We'll get the results quickly. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If it just a little prick of the finger, then yes, I suppose so. I want to know what causing this trouble, you know? Anything better than just feeling sick all the time. Just tell me if it going to hurt bad, that’s all.
DOCTOR: It will be a very quick pinch, Bianca. Honestly, most people don't find it painful. I’ll clean your finger first, then gently prick it. It’ll only take a few seconds. Okay, let’s get this done. Just relax your hand for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I does try to be brave, you know? But tell me if it sting. I not good with pain, even little pain. Just…be quick, eh?
DOCTOR: There, just a quick pinch. Okay… the reading is 210 mg/dL. That’s a bit high, Bianca. A normal reading would be under 100 mg/dL. This suggests you may have diabetes. I want to do another test, a fasting blood sugar test, to confirm this. You'll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. That sound…serious, Doctor. My mother, she had that. It not a good sickness, you know? So I have to not eat nothing all night? Just water? That going to be hard, you know? I does get so hungry. But…if it what I have, I suppose I have to do it. Tomorrow morning is alright. What time I need to come? And…what does this mean, Doctor? What happen now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Bianca. It can be a worrying diagnosis. Diabetes is a serious condition, but it is manageable with lifestyle changes and medication, if needed. It means your body isn’t processing sugar properly, which can lead to several health problems if left untreated. We’ll need to monitor your blood sugar levels, make some changes to your diet, and possibly start you on medication. We'll discuss all of that thoroughly once we have the results from the fasting blood sugar test tomorrow morning. Please try not to worry too much right now. We'll take things one step at a time. Tomorrow morning, come in at 8:00 AM. And yes, only water before the test. I’ll give you a slip for the lab. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Eight o'clock then. Only water. Alright. Hmm… what kind of changes to my diet? I does eat a lot of rice, you know? And plantains. And I does like a sweet drink sometimes. Will I have to stop eating all that? It sound very hard, Doctor. And…my husband, he not so good at cooking different things. He just make rice and beans, mostly. Will I have to learn how to cook all new things?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Bianca. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have to completely eliminate everything you enjoy, but we’ll need to make some adjustments. Reducing your intake of sugary drinks and foods high in carbohydrates, like rice and plantains, is a good starting point. We can work with you to find healthier alternatives. I can refer you to a nutritionist who can help you create a meal plan that’s both healthy and enjoyable. And we can also discuss some simple recipes that your husband can easily prepare. It doesn't have to be complicated. Here’s the name and number of a nutritionist in the area. She’s very good at working with patients to create customized plans. We'll figure this out together. For now, try not to worry too much. Come in tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM for the fasting blood sugar test. And if you have any questions before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all for now. You explain everything very good. I still scared, you know? But I suppose I have to do it. Eight o'clock tomorrow, only water, and I will call the nutritionist. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I suppose I will go home now. It a long night ahead, with no food.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I understand your anxiety, but you are taking the right steps. And remember, we'll be here to support you every step of the way. Here’s the information again. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Get some rest tonight, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get a better understanding of things tomorrow. Have a good evening, Bianca. And thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. I will try my best to not worry, but it hard, you know? Thank you for your kindness. Goodbye, Doctor.
