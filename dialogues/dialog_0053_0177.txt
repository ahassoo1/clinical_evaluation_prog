DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. Doyle Pitmon, Doctor. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor Pitmon, right? Well... it's a little embarrassing, to be honest. Something's... leaking. Down there. It's not good. Not good at all. I don't know what it is, but it's definitely leaking. It started a few days ago, maybe? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” you say. Right. Well, that is concerning, certainly. A few days ago… alright. It's good you came in. Now, can you describe this "leaking" a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precise? Oh, goodness. I'm not a doctor, you know. It's… wet. And kinda… yellowish? Not like pee, though. Thicker. And it smells… not nice. Like old fish, maybe? Honestly, I just noticed it when I was… getting ready this morning. It stained my clothes a little. It’s just… icky. I haven't been sick or anything, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: Alright, yellowish, thicker than urine, with an odor… not pleasant. And staining your clothes. Okay. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or itching accompanying this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Maybe a little… uncomfortable. Like when your underwear is too tight. But not a sharp pain, no. And no burning. Itching… sometimes, a little, but I always itch. Old age, you know? Everything itches. I don’t think that’s new. Honestly, I’m just worried it’s something… awful. You see a lot of things in this world.
DOCTOR: Well, worrying won’t help, Mrs. Genard. Itching can be a symptom of many things, as you know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination – frequency, urgency, difficulty?
PATIENT: Urination? Let me think… No, not really. I go when I need to go, just like always. Maybe a little more often at night, but that’s just getting old, right? I have to get up once or twice, but I always have. And no trouble… it comes out fine. Nothing’s… stuck or anything. Honestly, I mostly just worry about this… leak. It's embarrassing, you know? A lady shouldn’t have to deal with this.
DOCTOR: Right, so no changes in urination other than the usual nighttime frequency. And this "leak" is your primary concern. Have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never. I’ve had children, of course, but this isn't like that at all. This is… different. And it just started, like I said. A few days ago. Maybe four? I really don’t keep track. I don’t have… boyfriends or anything these days, so it’s not from… that. It just… appeared. It's very unsettling. I really don't understand what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Well, we’ll try to figure it out. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh dear. What does that… involve? I’m not good with… poking and prodding. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I really don’t like doctors much, to be honest. They always want to look at things. I just want this fixed. Can't you just give me some medicine?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your apprehension, but I need to examine you to determine the cause of this issue before I can even consider prescribing medication. It’s a standard procedure. I'll be as gentle as possible. It will involve a visual inspection of the area and potentially a swab to collect a sample. Nothing overly invasive, I assure you. It’s for your own good. Do you have any allergies to latex or any cleaning solutions?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t used… things like that in a long time. Cleaning solutions… maybe? I use whatever my niece buys me. She’s a good girl, always trying to help. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction, though. Honestly, I mostly just get rashes from the sun. And mosquito bites. But nothing like… a reaction to medicine or anything. This all sounds very… complicated. Can’t you just look at it? Without all the… swabs and solutions? It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, a visual inspection alone is often insufficient. A swab allows me to analyze the discharge and identify any potential infection. It’s a simple procedure that will significantly help with diagnosis. We need to rule out any serious causes. I understand your nervousness, but delaying proper investigation could lead to complications. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis. It’s a little pill, pink, I think. Doctor Reyes prescribed it. It helps with the pain in my hands. And sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, but not every day. Only when it’s high. My niece checks it for me. Honestly, I mostly just take vitamins. And a little something for my sleep. But that doesn’t really help. It just makes me… groggy. Does that matter? All those little pills… I forget what they’re even for sometimes. It's just a lot.
DOCTOR: Right. Arthritis medication, occasional blood pressure medication, vitamins, and something for sleep. Okay. Now, to proceed with the examination, you will need to lie on the examination table. I will provide a gown for your comfort. I'll need you to undress from the waist down. I will leave the room to allow you privacy. Please call out when you are ready, and I will return. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Undress…? Oh dear. That’s… a little embarrassing. I haven’t… really looked at myself down there in a long time. And I’m not very flexible these days. I might need help getting back up. And I don’t want to be… rude. But… alright. I guess I have to. But you won’t… stare, will you? And please be quick. And gentle. I really don't like this at all. Just… let me know when you’re coming back, so I don’t… jump.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I assure you, this is a professional medical examination. My focus is solely on diagnosing and treating your condition. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I will maintain your privacy at all times. I will knock before re-entering the room. Please take your time, and call out when you are ready. I’ll leave the room now.
