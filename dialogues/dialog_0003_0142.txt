DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Right, well… it’s my head. Been getting these headaches, pretty bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart feels like it’s… racing, I guess. It’s been happening on and off for a while now. Honestly, I can’t really put my finger on when it started exactly. Feels like… a long time.
DOCTOR: “On and off for a long time” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Lawther. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry. I know, it’s not great, is it? Um… maybe… six months? At least. It’s hard to say, things have been a bit… blurry lately. It's not every day, definitely not. More like… a few times a month, maybe? And they seem to be getting… worse, I think. I really can’t remember if that's true or not though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when these headaches occur, can you describe the type of pain?
PATIENT: Type of pain… That's a good question. It's not, like, a sharp pain. More… a throbbing, I suppose? It feels like… pressure, all over my head, kinda. And it’s usually on both sides, not just one spot. It makes me feel really sick sometimes, too. Not gonna lie. Like I might be sick, you know? But usually I don’t actually… well, you get what I mean.
DOCTOR: “Usually” is another vague descriptor, Mr. Lawther. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, right, yeah, sorry again. I think… I think I’ve been sick a couple of times during them. Not every time, definitely not. Maybe… two or three times in the last six months? It's hard to say for sure, it was a while ago and... I had a bit of a rough patch then. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A “rough patch?
PATIENT: Yeah… divorce. It was… messy. A bit of drinking, not sleeping, the usual. It's all sorted now, mostly. I'm… doing okay. Trying to, anyway. I just… haven't really thought about if that had anything to do with the headaches, to be honest. I just figured… stress, you know?
DOCTOR: “Figuring” is not a substitute for a proper medical history, Mr. Lawther. Do you still consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. Not… a lot. A couple of beers at the weekend, maybe? Nothing crazy. I wouldn't say it's a problem, not anymore. I used to drink more, when things were… bad. But I've cut back. Honestly, I probably have a pint or two on a Saturday and that's it. Maybe a bit more if I'm with mates. But really, not much. I swear.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mum used to get headaches sometimes, but she just put it down to stress, you know? And my grandad… he had something, I think. Something with his memory, when he got older. But I don’t know what it was. I never really asked. We weren’t… close, you see? No one really talked about health stuff. So… not really. I don’t think so. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to perform a brief neurological examination. Please just follow my instructions. I need you to look straight ahead, and I’m going to check your pupils.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. No problem. Just tell me what to do. I'm not great at medical stuff, as you've probably gathered.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head. Good. Now, I want you to close your eyes. Can you tell me when I touch your forehead and then your cheeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Now… now. And… now. That's… that's pretty good, right? I can feel you. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Sensory perception intact. Now, I want you to squeeze your hands as tightly as you can. Good. Now, can you push your feet against my hands?
PATIENT: Like this? Okay, yeah. As hard as I can? Is that alright? I’m not very strong, to be honest. Used to be a bit fitter, but… not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are present and symmetrical. Alright. Based on this preliminary examination and your… somewhat limited history, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your headaches. However, given the pattern, your recent life stressors, and alcohol consumption, it could be tension headaches or possibly migraines. I recommend a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… umm. No, not that I know of. Never really taken much medication, to be honest. A paracetamol here and there for a cold, that's about it. Nothing serious. So… blood tests, then? That sounds… alright. Will it be expensive? I'm not exactly flush with cash at the moment. I don’t have insurance, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: That does make a difference, Mr. Lawther. I will write you a requisition for the blood work. The cost will depend on the lab. I can provide you with a list of local labs, and you can inquire about their pricing. I also suggest reducing your alcohol intake, managing stress, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule. If the headaches worsen or are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Right, yeah, I understand. Less drinking, more sleep, look out for… all those things. Blood tests, check prices… Got it. Thank you, Doc. I appreciate it. I really do. It's just… a bit worrying, you know? Having something wrong, and not knowing what it is. I hope it's nothing too serious.
