DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is as it should be, you understand. A woman of my age has to be… thorough.
DOCTOR: Thorough, yes. Of course. And what specifically are you concerned about, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: Honestly? Everything. I mean, I’ve been… careful in my life, and I don't want to take any chances now. It’s just… one hears things. And I want to make sure she is being as careful as I am. It's… a matter of standards, really. I suppose a general check-up is in order, to be certain. You do have a good reputation, I was told.
DOCTOR: A “general check-up,” as you say. Very well. Let’s start with the basics then. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not precisely. I feel… perfectly fine. It’s preventative, Doctor. It’s about knowing. About having peace of mind. I don't want to be sick, and I want to make sure I'm not… harboring anything unpleasant. I do tire easily, perhaps, but that’s probably just the summer heat. And a woman my age… one expects a little fatigue, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Fatigue can be…multifactorial, as we say. Alright. Let’s move through a quick review of your medical history, just to get a baseline. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I take excellent care of myself. I’ve always been very particular about my diet, and I exercise regularly – gentle walks, mostly. I’ve never had a serious illness, thank goodness. My mother always said strong genes were the key, and I seem to have inherited them. Though, she did have a touch of arthritis in her later years, but that was hardly debilitating. Really, I'm remarkably healthy for my age. I'm on Medicare, of course, but that’s just standard procedure, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. Good. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been too sensible to risk it. I've had a few…cosmetic procedures, naturally, a woman has to maintain appearances, but nothing major. Just a little smoothing here and there. Certainly nothing that would affect my overall health. I believe strongly in prevention, Doctor, not correction. It’s a far better approach, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Prevention is… advisable. Family history, then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, anything you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… a type of cancer, I believe. It was a long time ago, so the details are a bit hazy. She didn’t live very long after the diagnosis. And my uncle, he had heart trouble. A very unhealthy man, always smoking and drinking. Truly, a cautionary tale. My father’s side of the family… well, they weren’t particularly forthcoming about their health, so I don’t have much information there. But I’ve always been diligent about screenings, just to be safe. One can’t be too careful, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve had the occasional antibiotic, of course, for a cold or a minor infection, but I’ve never had a reaction. I’m very careful about what I put into my body. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, though I recognize their limitations. Honestly, Doctor, I'm quite meticulous about my health. It's a bit of a hobby, really. I read a great deal about wellness.
DOCTOR: Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, yes. I take a multivitamin, naturally. And a calcium supplement for bone health. I also take a CoQ10 supplement, I read it’s good for energy levels. And sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit run down, I’ll take some echinacea. But that’s hardly a regular occurrence. Really, that’s all. I believe in bolstering my system, not masking symptoms. It’s a very holistic approach, you see. I get everything from a reputable online pharmacy, of course. One must be discerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Please have a seat on the examination table. </stage>
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose that’s sensible. Though, I must say, I feel perfectly fine. But if you insist. Do be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/86. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Sensation is intact. Neurological exam is grossly normal. BMI is 33.8, placing you in the obese category. We should discuss weight management strategies.
PATIENT: Obese? That’s… rather harsh, Doctor. I am… robustly built, perhaps. But “obese” is such a… clinical term. And frankly, I find it rather judgmental. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I’ve already explained. A little extra padding is hardly a cause for concern. Is that going to affect the… results of whatever tests you intend to run? Because frankly, I’m concerned about the accuracy of your assessment.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, BMI is a standardized measurement. It is not a judgment, merely an observation. While you describe a healthy lifestyle, your weight does present a risk factor for several conditions. Let’s proceed with some blood work to assess your cholesterol, blood sugar, and thyroid function. We should also run a complete blood count to rule out any underlying issues. Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results?
PATIENT: Well, if you insist. But I do wish you wouldn’t focus so much on my… physical appearance. It’s rather insulting, frankly. I came here for peace of mind, not a lecture on my weight. Very well, blood work it is. And yes, a follow-up appointment would be… prudent. Though I expect a thorough explanation of the results, and I expect it to be delivered without any… unwarranted commentary. And please, ensure the lab technician is… discreet. I wouldn't want this information falling into the wrong hands.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. Your privacy is our utmost concern. The lab is located down the hall to your left. They will handle the blood draw and send the results to my office. A nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available, typically within five to seven business days. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all for now. Though, I must reiterate, I expect a comprehensive report, devoid of any… subjective interpretations. And please, do ensure the results are kept strictly confidential. I shall await the nurse’s call. Thank you, Doctor.
