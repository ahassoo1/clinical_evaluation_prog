DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. Well, my foot… it’s been botherin’ me. A sore, really. A bad one. It won’t go away. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. Been achin’ for a good while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emiliano. A sore on the bottom of your foot near your toes that’s been aching for a while. Can you tell me a little more about that ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… a deep, dull ache. It’s there most of the time, but it gets worse when I walk, especially if I walk a lot. Sometimes, at night, it feels like… pins and needles. Not always, but sometimes. It makes it hard to wear my slippers, even.
DOCTOR: Alright, a deep, dull ache that worsens with walking and sometimes includes pins and needles, particularly at night. And it’s affecting your ability to wear slippers comfortably. Have you noticed any redness, swelling, or drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Redness… yes, a little. Not a lot, but it’s red around the edges. And… well, sometimes it gets a little wet. Not a lot of water, though. It’s… kinda sticky, if you know what I mean. It’s not… pus, I don’t think. Just… sticky. I try to keep it clean with a cloth, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, some redness around the edges and a little sticky drainage that isn’t necessarily pus, but is difficult to keep clean. Have you had any fever, chills, or body aches along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my body doesn't ache, no. Just the foot. I haven’t felt sick, just… tired, maybe. Old age, you understand? It’s hard to tell what’s just gettin’ old and what’s somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emiliano. It can be difficult to tell what's normal for you and what's new. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor… he told me I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. Been havin’ it for… a long time now. Maybe fifteen years? Something like that. I take pills for it, every day. And… I had some trouble with my heart a long time ago, but it’s been okay for a while now. I see a different doctor for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of diabetes for about fifteen years, managed with medication, and a past history of heart trouble. Do you recall the name of the medication you're taking for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My daughter, Leilani, she usually handles my pills. She puts them in these little boxes, you see? I just take them. It’s… a white pill, I think. Small one. I’m sorry, I don’t remember the name. I should ask Leilani.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. We can look it up in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat all kinds of things. Leilani always makes me try new fruits, even. She says it’s good for me. No, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned seeing a different doctor for your heart. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Yes… a long time ago. When I was younger, I had surgery on my chest. For my heart. It was a long time ago, maybe thirty years? I was in the hospital for a while. But I haven’t been in the hospital since then. Just regular check-ups with the heart doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, surgery on your chest thirty years ago for your heart, but no hospitalizations since then. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had the sugar sickness too. Like me. And my father… he had trouble with his heart when he got older. He didn't take care of himself like he should have. And my sister… she had some kind of sickness, a bad one, a long time ago. But I don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and heart disease. Let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ or drinkin’. Never touched those things. And no… nothin’ like that. I used to fish a lot, but I don’t get out much anymore. My legs… they get tired. Mostly I just sit and watch the birds.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. You used to fish but now primarily rest. Now, I’d like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Please, have a look. It’s been botherin’ me a lot. I’ll take my slipper off now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. Okay, I see the sore here on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It's approximately one centimeter in diameter and has some redness around the edges, as you mentioned. I also notice some dried drainage. It feels warm to the touch, and there is some tenderness when I press on it. I don't feel any swelling in your foot. Your pulses feel normal, which is good. I'm concerned about the possibility of an infection, given the redness, warmth, and drainage. Because you have diabetes, infections can sometimes be more difficult to treat and can take longer to heal. I want to be cautious.
PATIENT: Oh dear. An infection? That doesn’t sound good. I try to keep it clean, I really do. What… what does that mean, Doctor? Will I need… more pills? Or… will I have to go to the hospital? I don’t want to go to the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need more pills or a hospital stay right away. But because of your diabetes, it’s important to rule out a deeper infection. To do that, I’d like to order a couple of tests. First, a simple blood test to check for signs of infection in your body. And second, a swab of the sore to see what kind of bacteria might be causing the problem, if any. These tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. If it is an infection, we may need to start you on antibiotics, which are pills to fight the bacteria. And depending on the results, we might also need to take an X-ray of your foot to make sure it hasn’t affected the bone. We can discuss the X-ray if it becomes necessary. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… pills… that sounds… a lot. But… I want my foot to feel better. I don’t want it to get worse. If you think it’s best, then… yes. Do the tests. And… how long will it take to get the results? Will I be able to walk on it? I have to get to the store for groceries.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you agree. The blood test and swab should only take a few minutes, and we can get the results back within a day or two, usually. Regarding walking, I recommend minimizing weight-bearing on your foot as much as possible until we have the results back. That means trying to avoid walking long distances or standing for extended periods. We can discuss getting you a temporary walking boot if needed to reduce the pressure on your foot, depending on how much pain you're experiencing. For now, keep the area clean and dry, and I'll have the nurse give you a special dressing to apply to the sore. We’ll also talk about keeping your blood sugar under control, as that will help with healing. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A walking boot… hmm. I don’t know… those sound… uncomfortable. But if it helps, then I guess. And keepin’ my sugar under control… Leilani will be happy to hear that. She’s always tellin’ me what I can and can’t eat. Yes, Doctor, it sounds… manageable. As long as I don’t have to go to the hospital. What about the pain? Is there anything I can take for the pain? It’s been keepin’ me awake at night.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the hospital, and I don't anticipate that being necessary at this point. As for the pain, yes, absolutely. You can take over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage the discomfort. However, because of your medical history, it’s important to check with Leilani or your primary care physician about the appropriate dosage, especially if you have any other medical conditions. I’m going to write you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever, just in case the over-the-counter medications aren’t enough. Please only use it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. I'm also going to have the nurse give you some written instructions about wound care, medication, and when to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Emiliano?
PATIENT: Wound care… instructions… okay. That’s good. I like havin’ things written down. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Hmm… let me see. Does this mean I can’t go swimmin’? I like to swim in the ocean when it’s warm. But I don’t want to get the sore infected. And… will it take a long time to heal?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Emiliano. And it's wise to think about that. No, you should definitely avoid swimming in the ocean until the sore is completely healed. Ocean water can contain bacteria that could worsen the infection. We need to keep it clean and dry. As for how long it will take to heal, that depends on the severity of the infection, if there is one, and how well your blood sugar is controlled. It could take several weeks, or even a few months, for the sore to completely heal. It’s important to be patient and follow the wound care instructions carefully. We will monitor your progress closely, and I will let you know when it’s safe to resume your activities. Are there any other concerns I can address for you before I have the nurse come in with the instructions and supplies?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. I appreciate it. I just want my foot to feel better so I can go back to watchin’ the birds.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emiliano. I’m glad I could help. And I understand wanting to get back to your routine. We’ll do everything we can to get your foot feeling better so you can enjoy watching the birds again. I’ll have the nurse come in now with the instructions and supplies. She’ll go over everything with you in detail, and you can ask her any questions you may have. Nurse, could you please come in here?
