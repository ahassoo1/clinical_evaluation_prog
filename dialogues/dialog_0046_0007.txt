DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… painful. That is why I am here. I work with fences, you see, and it’s been hurting for some time now. I’d like to get it fixed if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, “painful” – that’s a good starting point. And you mentioned working with fences. Is the pain related to your work with fences, Ms. Reihner?
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely related. It’s my back, mostly. And sometimes my shoulder. Lifting… and bending… it makes it worse. I try to ignore it, but it’s getting harder to do my job.
DOCTOR: I understand. So the pain is primarily in your back, and sometimes radiates to your shoulder, and it’s aggravated by lifting and bending. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It started… about six months ago, I believe. It was just a little ache at first, after a long day. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. About three months ago it started really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six months of symptoms, with a noticeable increase in severity around three months ago. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It’s… a deep ache. Not sharp, usually. More like a heavy weight is on my back. And when I move… sometimes it feels like something is catching. A little bit of a burn, maybe. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand. A deep ache with a catching sensation and sometimes a burning feeling. That’s helpful. Does anything relieve the pain, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Rest, mostly. Lying down flat. And… sometimes a hot bath. But it doesn’t last long. As soon as I get back to work, it comes back. I have tried some creams, but they didn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, rest and hot baths provide some temporary relief. And the creams weren’t effective. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No tingling. No weakness. Just… the ache. And the trouble moving. It’s mostly in my back, but like I said, it sometimes goes into my shoulder. I can still lift things, but it’s harder and it hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: I… I haven't had much trouble with my health, honestly. Just the usual colds and flu. My husband… he passed away five years ago. He had… heart trouble. I don’t have any regular doctors, I usually just avoid going unless I have to. I have Medicare. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is perfectly alright. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like you’ve been quite healthy overall, aside from the occasional cold or flu. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than those illnesses?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. No hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. It healed fine. Just the usual things. I try to stay active, even with the pain. Working is important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood broken arm. And you mentioned staying active despite the pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I don’t take anything regularly. Just… sometimes aspirin for a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies or regular medications. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, like arthritis, back problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: My mother had arthritis, Doctor. In her hands, mostly. It bothered her a lot when she got older. My father… he was healthy, I think. He died when I was young. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents. They lived far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis on your mother’s side. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. I work most days. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re on your own. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t have much time for hobbies. Mostly just work and trying to keep the house clean.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Reihner. That gives me a good overview of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on with your back and shoulder. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this fixed, if possible. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on your stomach, that would be great. I’m going to start by palpating your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll also assess your range of motion. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay, Ms. Reihner, is there any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes. Right… there. That hurts when you push. And a little bit… to the left. It’s not sharp, but it’s definitely tender.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lumbar region, slightly more pronounced on the left side. Alright, Ms. Reihner, could you try and bend forward as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… difficult. It hurts. Not terrible, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. I can’t go very far.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with discomfort. Now, could you slowly rotate your torso to the left, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: That’s… better than bending, but it still hurts. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. And… it feels tight. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited rotation with a tight sensation. Alright, Ms. Reihner, if you could please roll over onto your back for me. Now, I'm going to check your shoulder. Can you raise your arm out to the side?
PATIENT: It hurts a little, Doctor. Not terrible, but I can't go all the way up. It feels… stiff. Like it's stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion in your right shoulder with discomfort. And can you rotate your arm inward and outward?
PATIENT: It’s… harder to rotate it inward. That hurts more than lifting it up. Outward is okay, but not great. It feels like… something is pinching.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner. Thank you for your patience. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing muscle strain in your lower back, potentially with some facet joint irritation. The shoulder pain could be related, possibly referred pain from the back, or a separate issue like rotator cuff tendinitis. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lumbar spine to rule out any structural issues, and possibly an MRI if the pain doesn’t improve. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-rays and MRIs… That sounds… complicated. And expensive. Will that take a long time? I really just want to get back to work. Is there anything else we can try first? Like… a stronger painkiller or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Reihner. You're right, imaging can be a bit involved. We can certainly explore other options first. Before we jump to stronger painkillers, which can have side effects and don't address the underlying cause, I recommend a course of physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles, improve your posture, and alleviate your pain. I'll also prescribe a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation in the meantime. Would you be comfortable trying that approach first?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds better than those machines. And medicine is alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t make me too sleepy. I need to be able to work. What kind of exercises will the physical therapy be? And how long will I have to go? I need to know if it will interfere with my job.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Reihner. The physical therapy will likely involve a combination of stretching, strengthening exercises, and postural training. They’ll start with gentle exercises to improve your range of motion and flexibility, and gradually progress to more challenging exercises as your pain subsides. They'll also teach you proper lifting techniques to prevent future injuries. Typically, a course of physical therapy lasts 6-8 weeks, with sessions 2-3 times per week. The sessions usually last about an hour each. We can discuss with the physical therapist to adjust the schedule to minimize disruption to your work. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant called cyclobenzaprine 10mg, to be taken at bedtime, and an anti-inflammatory medication called naproxen 500mg, to be taken twice daily with food. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Like I said before. And no other conditions. Just the usual aches and pains. Cyclobenzaprine and naproxen… alright. I will try it. Can I get a note for work? Just in case I need to take it easy for a few days? And… is there anything I can do at home besides the exercises? Like… stretches or something? I don’t want to just sit around and do nothing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I can absolutely provide you with a work note outlining your limitations – light duty work only, avoiding heavy lifting and repetitive bending. I will also provide instructions on gentle stretches you can do at home. For at home, I recommend gentle hamstring stretches – lying on your back and slowly bringing one knee towards your chest. Also, pelvic tilts – lying on your back with your knees bent and gently rocking your pelvis forward and backward. Avoid any movements that cause significant pain. Here are the work note and the exercise instructions. I’m also going to send a referral to a physical therapist, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. I would like to see you back in 2-3 weeks to reassess your progress. If your pain worsens or doesn't improve after a week, please contact the clinic to schedule an earlier appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you for your help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully, this will get me back to work soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I’m glad I could help. I understand how important it is for you to get back to work, and I’m optimistic that we can get you there. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Get well soon. .
