DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. It’s about my… well, it’s about bruising. I’ve been getting a lot of it lately, and it’s… concerning. I’m on a blood thinner, you see, and I’m quite meticulous about the dosage. It just doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. Bruising when you’re on a blood thinner is something we need to investigate. And it’s good you’re so diligent about your medication. Let’s start with a little more detail about these bruises. When did you first notice them appearing more frequently?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… gradual. Perhaps a month or so ago, I bumped my arm on the doorframe – nothing serious, a little sting – and it bruised far more than it should have. Then it started happening with other small things. Just… everyday knocks. I haven't fallen, haven’t been in any accidents, nothing like that. It’s just… easier bruising, is all. And they seem to last longer too, now that I think about it. It’s… irritating, frankly. I pride myself on being careful.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been a change over the past month, with easier bruising and longer healing times, even with minor impacts. That’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, are these bruises appearing in unusual places – places you wouldn't expect from minor bumps, or are they mostly on your arms and legs where you might get the occasional knock?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I did notice one on my back, a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t recall hitting it on anything. And another one… on my thigh. Again, no particular incident that I can think of. Mostly arms and legs, yes, but these others are… unsettling. I haven’t exactly been tumbling around, Doctor. It’s not as though I’m a clumsy sort. I maintain a rather dignified bearing, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: That’s important information, Mr. Farson. Bruising in unexpected areas without a clear cause is definitely something we should look into further. Let's go through some other things to get a better picture of what might be happening. Do you have any other symptoms you’ve noticed – fatigue, weakness, bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, nosebleeds, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in bowel habits? Really, Doctor? Are we looking for everything now? No, no changes there. I feel… tired, perhaps a little more than usual, but I'm 58 years old! One doesn’t exactly spring around like a young colt at my age, you know. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, nothing of that sort. Just… the bruising. And a slight… annoyance, frankly, at having to come here to explain this. I’ve always been a very healthy man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson, and I apologize if my questions seem extensive. We just want to rule out any potential underlying causes. It’s good you've been generally healthy. Now, let’s talk about your medications. You mentioned being on a blood thinner – can you tell me the name of it and the dosage you take?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin. Five milligrams daily. I’ve been on it for… oh, must be seven years now, since the… the incident. And I get my levels checked regularly, as you know. I’m quite diligent about keeping up with those appointments. My doctor before, Dr. Hernandez, he always said I was a model patient. I’ve never missed a dose, and I’ve always followed his instructions to the letter. So I don’t understand why this is happening. It’s… unsettling, frankly.
DOCTOR: I see your recent INR results here, and they have been consistently within the therapeutic range. That’s good, but it doesn’t rule everything out. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Goodness. Well, the… the heart thing, of course. That's why I'm on the Warfarin. A-fib, they called it. Nothing else of any real consequence. High blood pressure, managed with… let me see… Lisinopril, I believe. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. Other than that, I’ve always been remarkably robust. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for complaining. This bruising is… atypical. It's quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of atrial fibrillation managed with Warfarin, and hypertension controlled with Lisinopril. That gives me a better understanding. Now, regarding your family history – are there any bleeding disorders or unusual bruising tendencies that run in your family?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? Not that I'm aware of. My father was a… a very stern man, quite robust. He lived to be 85, and he never had a speck of trouble. My mother… well, she passed away young. Breast cancer, unfortunately. No history of… easy bruising in either of them, as far as I know. We weren’t exactly a family that discussed ailments, if you catch my meaning. A stiff upper lip was the order of the day. It’s… a Guatemalan thing, perhaps. We don't advertise weaknesses.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Farson. It’s helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I'm not a… a heavy drinker, Doctor. I consider myself a rather temperate man. And I certainly don’t indulge before or after medical appointments, if that's what you're implying. It would be… improper. I maintain a certain standard, you see.
DOCTOR: I wasn’t implying anything, Mr. Farson. Just gathering information. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. Disgusting habit. My father wouldn’t have allowed it. And frankly, I’ve always considered it… uncouth. A civilized man doesn’t engage in such practices. I have always prioritized my health, you see. Which makes this bruising all the more perplexing. It’s… a contradiction, frankly. A model patient, as my previous doctor said, suddenly afflicted with… this. It's quite irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Given your history and the recent change in bruising, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at the bruises themselves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I fail to see what good poking and prodding will do. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. But if it will satisfy the… protocol, then proceed. Just be gentle, if you would. I have a rather sensitive constitution. And please, no cold implements. I detest the sensation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll make sure everything is at room temperature. Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or irregularities detected. Your lungs are clear. The bruises appear to be mostly on your extremities, as you mentioned, with varying shades of purple and blue, indicating different stages of healing. They’re slightly tender to the touch, but no swelling or warmth is present. I don’t see any evidence of other skin changes. Based on the exam, and your history, the bruising is concerning, despite your stable INR. To be thorough, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . These tests will help rule out any underlying blood disorders or kidney problems that could be contributing to the bruising. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests, of course. More poking and prodding, and waiting for results. Very well. If it must be done. But I expect a prompt response. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, Doctor, ensure the laboratory personnel are… competent. I wouldn’t want any mislabeling of samples or… inaccuracies. My time is valuable. And frankly, I’m losing patience with this entire affair. I simply want to know what's causing this… this inexplicable bruising, and to resume my normal, healthy life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Farson, that’s not too much to ask at all. I completely understand your frustration, and I assure you I’ll expedite the lab orders and follow up with you as soon as the results are available. I will personally review them and contact you, likely within 48 hours. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do happen to bump yourself, applying ice immediately. And please, don't hesitate to call if the bruising worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or bleeding from unusual sites. Here’s the form for the lab tests. The lab is located… . Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s appointment?
PATIENT: Directions, of course. I suppose I should thank you for your… diligence. Though I remain skeptical that these tests will reveal anything of consequence. But I will follow your instructions. No, I believe that is all. I have other… engagements. I expect a prompt response, Doctor. And accurate results. Good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Farson. I will certainly do my best to provide you with a prompt and accurate response. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
