DOCTOR: Alright then, Chellsea. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well… it’s about my health. I… I was told I have cancer. It’s a bit much to take in, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. That is what the other doctor… explained. I don’t really understand everything he said. It was a lot of… words. And very scary words, at that. I just… I wanted a second opinion, if that makes sense. And maybe… someone who can explain it a little clearer?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A second opinion is always wise, dear. And it's perfectly understandable to be overwhelmed with medical jargon. That’s what I’m here for. Now, before we get too far, can you tell me who told you this, and roughly what kind of cancer they suspected?
PATIENT: It was Doctor Reynolds, over at City General. He said… something about it being in my chest? I think he said “pulmonary,” but I didn’t… well, I don’t know what that means. He ordered some scans, and then he told me about the cancer. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It’s just… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine, dear. It is difficult. "Pulmonary" refers to your lungs. So, he suspects something in your lungs. Do you mind if I take a look at the reports from Doctor Reynolds?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I have them right here. Here you are. I made sure to bring everything he gave me. It’s… a lot of papers.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's see… Chest X-ray, CT scan report… yes. Hmm. Well, there is a nodule here. It’s… small. Now, a nodule doesn't automatically equal cancer, you understand. Many things can cause these. But it does need investigating. And you did the right thing coming in for a second opinion. What symptoms, if any, brought you to Doctor Reynolds in the first place?
PATIENT: I had a cough, Doctor. It wouldn’t go away. And I was… very tired, all the time. Just… exhausted. I thought it was just getting older, honestly. I didn’t think much of it. It just kept getting worse, so I finally went to see him. He sent me for the scans after that. I didn't have any pain, though. Not at first.
DOCTOR: Alright. A persistent cough and fatigue. No pain initially. And how long ago did you first notice the cough and tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe… six months ago? The tiredness was gradual, so it’s hard to say exactly. But the cough definitely started about six months ago. It was just a little tickle at first, but then it got… deeper. And more frequent. I thought it was a cold, but it just wouldn’t clear up.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been losing weight. Not on purpose, of course. I haven’t been eating much, because I just don’t feel hungry. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath, especially when I walk up the stairs. It’s not terrible, but it’s… noticeable. I thought it was just me getting out of shape, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Weight loss, loss of appetite, and shortness of breath... Yes. Alright, Chellsea. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Can you step up onto the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on, if you can tell me. It's… frightening, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths, please. In and out… very good. Hmm. I do hear some diminished breath sounds on the lower right lobe. Nothing too concerning at this stage, but it warrants further investigation. Now, let’s listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay. I am listening, Doctor. Just tell me if there's anything… wrong. This is all very new to me.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your blood pressure is normal. Your pulse is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, dear. Now, I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes, just to check for any swelling. This will just take a moment. Everything feels…normal there as well. It's good that we're not finding any obvious signs of…spread. But that doesn't rule anything out, of course. Now, I’d like to order a few more tests. A CBC—a complete blood count—to get a better idea of your overall health. And a sputum test—that’s a sample of mucus from your lungs—to check for any abnormal cells. We'll also repeat the CT scan, with contrast. That will give us a clearer picture of the nodule. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Doctor. All of it. Yes, please order those tests. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know… what I’m facing. When… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Good. The lab work shouldn't take more than a couple of days. The CT scan will be a bit longer, probably three to five business days. We'll get the results sent directly to me, and I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Now, while we're waiting for the results, it's important to try and manage your anxiety. Are you experiencing any other symptoms I should be aware of – night sweats, persistent fever, any new pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: No… no night sweats. No fever, either. And no new pain. Just… the tiredness. And the cough. And… worrying. I suppose worrying counts as a symptom. I’ve been having trouble sleeping, because I keep thinking about it. It’s hard to relax. I lost my husband last year, and… well, it’s just one thing after another. I feel very alone.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, grief can certainly exacerbate things. It’s good that you’re acknowledging that. Now, regarding the cough and tiredness… I’m going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help with the discomfort. It won’t cure anything, but it should make you a little more comfortable. As for the tiredness, it’s important to get as much rest as possible. But truthfully, dear, it's difficult to say what's causing it until we have those test results back. It could be anything. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. No, none at all. I haven’t taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers now and then. I understand it’s hard to say what’s causing it. I just… I keep imagining the worst. It’s silly, I know. But I can’t help it. I just want to know what I'm dealing with, and… if there’s anything I can do. Anything at all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, dwelling on the negative won't help, dear. Best to remain practical. Once we have the test results, we'll have a clearer picture. And then we can discuss options. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for the cough suppressant. And I’ll also have the nurse give you a list of resources for grief counseling, if you're interested. Just try and take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me before I let you go?
PATIENT: Grief counseling… yes, that might be helpful. Thank you. Um… Just… what kind of options would there be? If it is cancer? What… what do people do? I don’t want to be a burden. I just… I don’t know what to expect. I suppose that’s silly, isn’t it? Asking before I even know for sure.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, it's far too early to discuss options. There’s a wide range, depending on the type and stage. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiation… But frankly, speculating now is unproductive and will only cause unnecessary anxiety. We need the test results first. Now, I understand you’re worried, but it's important to focus on getting through these next few days. Rest, try and eat healthy, and please, don't dwell on worst-case scenarios. We'll cross that bridge when—and if—we come to it. Do you have any other questions, or can I let you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. For your time. And for the… prescription. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results. Goodbye. .
