DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's about a letter. A letter for… a pet, I think? Honestly, these things always feel like such a bother. Someone said I needed something from a doctor to… prove I can handle a pet. It's all a bit silly, really. I had a pet once, a lovely thing... but it's been years. Years and years. What exactly do they need this letter for?
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re referring to a documentation request related to pet ownership, perhaps for a rental property or homeowners association. These requests are becoming more common, and while they can seem unusual, they are generally intended to ensure responsible pet ownership. To help me complete this documentation for you, I'll need to gather some information about your health and lifestyle. It's not about judging your ability to care for a pet, but rather ensuring you're able to meet the physical and emotional demands of pet care. First, could you tell me a little more about the pet you are hoping to acquire?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Yes, a rental, that's it. A very… particular rental. Look, I don’t really have a pet yet. I want a dog, a small one. A fluffy one. Not one of those yappy things, though. I just… want a companion, you know? I live alone now, and it gets a bit quiet. Honestly, I haven’t thought about the details much beyond that. What kind of details do you need? I just need them to say I'm… capable. I’m perfectly capable! I used to walk miles, you know. Before… well, before things changed. Is this going to be a long questionnaire?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright that you haven't finalized everything yet. We just need to cover some basics to fulfill the requirements of the rental agreement. It won’t be a terribly long questionnaire, Ms. Wrye, more of a conversation to get a better understanding of your overall health and daily life. To start, could you tell me a bit about your current activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level… hmm. Well, I do get out. I go to the market, you know, for groceries. And I have a friend, Beatrice, we sometimes go for tea. That involves… walking to her house. It’s not a long walk. And I watch television, of course. A lot of television. Does that count? Honestly, I used to be very active. I played tennis, years ago. But my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. Do you need a specific number of steps or something? Because I don't have one of those… what are they called? Fitness trackers?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. We don’t need a specific number, just a general idea of your daily activity. It sounds like you have some regular activity with errands and visits with Beatrice, which is good. You mentioned your knees aren’t what they used to be. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, just the usual old age aches and pains. They get stiff, especially if I sit for too long. And sometimes they… crack. It’s not painful, usually. Just… bothersome. I haven't been to a specialist or anything. I just try to avoid things that make them worse. Like running. I certainly wouldn't be running with a dog! Honestly, I'm not sure what they want with all these questions. Are they trying to make sure I can catch the dog if it runs away? Because I don't think I could. Not anymore. It’s all very… insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you have some manageable knee discomfort, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It's likely they're trying to assess your ability to provide the physical care a dog requires – walking, playing, and potentially managing unexpected situations. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, a typical day. Well, I usually wake up… whenever I wake up. I don’t really have a schedule. I have tea. Lots of tea. Then I watch the news. Sometimes I’ll read, but my eyes get tired. I’ll go to the market later in the day, maybe. And then… more television. I usually have something light for dinner. And then bed. It’s not very exciting, I assure you. Honestly, I mostly just… exist. Is that what they want to know? If I’m capable of existing? Because I’m very good at existing. I’ve been doing it for 44 years!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you have a comfortable, relaxing routine. It's helpful for me to understand your daily life. Now, thinking about your overall health, do you have any current medical conditions that are being treated?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a little pill for it every morning. And my cholesterol is a bit high, but they said I just need to watch what I eat. Which is hard, because I like my pastries. Other than that… not really. I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, don't they? I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. I just… don’t enjoy going. It’s always bad news, or poking and prodding. And frankly, it’s a bit embarrassing. They always ask me about my weight, you know. As if that has anything to do with anything!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Wrye. It's good to know you're managing your blood pressure with medication. And I understand your reluctance to visit the doctor, many people feel the same way. Just to confirm, you mentioned high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but everyone does, right? And I used to get a rash when I was a child, from poison ivy, but I haven't encountered that in years. Honestly, I’m not very allergic. I eat everything. I love spices, exotic fruits… everything. I can’t think of anything I’m actually allergic to. I used to wear cheap jewelry and get a rash sometimes, but that was just because it was cheap jewelry, you know? Not a real allergy. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergy, thankfully. Is that what they’re worried about? If the dog licks me and I swell up? Because that would be dreadful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wrye. No known allergies are documented, which is helpful. Before we move on, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... just the blood pressure pill. It's a little white one. I take it every morning with my tea. Sometimes, if my head is really bothering me, I’ll take… a pain reliever. Like… ibuprofen. But not very often. And occasionally, if I'm feeling a bit… unsettled, I'll take something for my stomach. But that's only when I eat something dodgy, you know? Like at a party, or if I try a new restaurant. Otherwise, I don't really take any medication. Just the little white pill, and the occasional headache or stomach thing. Nothing serious, I assure you. Are they expecting a whole pharmacy full of pills? Because I certainly don't have that!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. It sounds like you manage any occasional discomfort with over-the-counter medications. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But honestly, my family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical details. They didn't really talk about those things. It was considered… impolite, I think. And they all lived to be quite old, actually. My grandmother lived to be 95! So, I suppose they were doing something right. It’s just… I don't have a lot of specifics. Is that what they need? A whole family tree of illnesses? Because I certainly don't have that! I barely remember what my cousins’ names are, let alone their medical conditions. It's all very… hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. It's common for families to not readily share medical details. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure and your father had diabetes is helpful. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, as I said, I enjoy a relaxing routine. I watch a lot of television, I read when my eyes allow, I have tea, I go to the market. I don't really smoke or drink. Never have, really. I used to enjoy dancing, but my knees… well, you know. I live alone now, so my social life is mostly limited to visiting Beatrice. And watching television. Honestly, I'm not a very exciting person. I don't go on adventures or anything. I mostly just… exist, quietly. Is that what they want to know? If I'm a wild party animal? Because I certainly am not! I prefer a quiet evening at home, with a cup of tea and a good program. It's all very… sensible, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wrye. That gives me a good understanding of your health and lifestyle. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… Well, I suppose. I’m not terribly fond of those, but if it’s necessary… What exactly will it involve? I don't want to be poked and prodded too much. And please, don't make me take off my shoes. I’m rather particular about my shoes. And I hope it won't take too long. I have a program I like to watch later. Just… be gentle, please. And explain everything as you go. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I understand your apprehension. The exam will be relatively brief and focused. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. I promise to be gentle and explain each step as I go. You are welcome to stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. And you absolutely do not need to remove your shoes. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and relax your arm for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure. Fine. Just… don't squeeze it too tight, please. And try to be quick. I don't like having things wrapped around my arm for too long. It makes me feel… constricted. And tell me if it's going to hurt. I have a very low pain threshold, you know. Honestly, I don't understand why they need to check it so often. It's just a number, isn't it? A silly little number. As long as I feel alright, what does it matter?
DOCTOR: I'll be as quick as possible, Ms. Wrye. It’s standard procedure to check your blood pressure as part of a routine exam, and it can provide valuable information about your overall health. It’s not just a number, but an indicator of how well your heart and blood vessels are functioning. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Slightly elevated… That’s what they always say, isn't it? Slightly elevated. As long as it's not critically elevated, I suppose it's alright. My mother had high blood pressure, too. Perhaps it's hereditary. Is everything alright? It doesn’t sound very good, does it? Like… a creaking noise. Or a bubbling sound. I always worry something is wrong. I’m rather prone to worrying, you know. It’s a terrible habit. And please, don't poke me in the back. I have a sensitive spine.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, with a normal rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear, with no signs of wheezing or crackling. The bubbling sound you heard was likely just the normal movement of air in your airways. Everything sounds within normal limits at this time. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Could you please open your mouth and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: “Ah.” Is everything alright in there? It doesn’t feel very good, you know, having something poked around in my mouth. I have sensitive gums. And please, don't make me stick out my tongue. That's just… undignified. Is it red? Is it swollen? I knew I shouldn't have eaten that spicy curry last week. It always gives me trouble. And please, tell me if you see anything… unpleasant. I don't want to be surprised. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable. Can we be done soon? I have a program I like to watch, you know.
DOCTOR: Your throat is a little red, but there’s no sign of infection or swelling. It’s likely just some irritation from the spicy curry. Your ears are clear and normal. Everything looks good, Ms. Wrye. Just some minor redness in your throat. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Abdomen… Oh dear. I’m not very fond of this part, you know. I have a delicate constitution. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily. And don’t poke too hard. I might scream. Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming here. Can we just skip this part? I feel perfectly alright, you know. Perfectly fine. And please, tell me if you find anything… unusual. I don’t want to be surprised. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. And please, don’t make me lift my legs. That’s just… undignified.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Ms. Wrye. I'm just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. There’s no sign of any masses or abnormalities. Everything feels normal. Everything feels good, Ms. Wrye. Just a soft and normal abdomen. That completes the physical exam. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You said everything was normal, didn’t you? Just… a little red throat. And slightly elevated blood pressure. And a soft abdomen. Honestly, it all sounds rather… unremarkable. So, can you write the letter now? The letter for the rental property? They need it soon, you know. And please, make it sound… convincing. That I'm perfectly capable of handling a pet. A small, fluffy dog. Not one of those yappy things. Just… a companion. And please, don't mention anything about my knees. Or my blood pressure. Or my sensitive stomach. Just… a capable pet owner. That’s all I need. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Wrye. I can certainly write a letter confirming your suitability for pet ownership. I’ll focus on your overall health and your ability to provide a loving and stable home for a companion animal. I’ll omit any mention of your knees or minor health concerns, as they are not relevant to your ability to care for a pet. Here you go. This letter confirms that you are in good health and capable of providing responsible care for a pet. It also states that you are of sound mind and body, and capable of handling the responsibilities of pet ownership. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm. “Sound mind and body…” That’s… good. Very good, actually. But does it say anything about being capable of handling a yappy dog? Those things are dreadful, you know. All that barking. And the shedding. Perhaps you could add a sentence about that? That I’m capable of handling a small, well-behaved dog? Just to be on the safe side. And perhaps mention that I’m a responsible and compassionate individual? Just to make it sound… convincing. And please, don’t mention anything about my television watching habits. That might make me sound… lazy. Honestly, I just want them to approve my application. I really want that dog.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I’m happy to make those additions. Here you go. I’ve added a sentence confirming your ability to handle a small, well-behaved dog, and another highlighting your responsible and compassionate nature. I’ve also omitted any mention of your television viewing habits, as you requested. I believe this letter should meet their requirements. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Yes. This is… perfect. Absolutely perfect. “Responsible and compassionate nature…” They can’t refuse me now. No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. And patient. Despite my… concerns. I suppose I should be going now. I have a program to watch, you know. And I need to start looking for a small, fluffy dog. Not a yappy one, of course. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best in finding the perfect companion. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your program.
