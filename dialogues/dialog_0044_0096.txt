DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, it’s… it’s about the sun, really. My eyes are just really bothered by it lately. More than they used to be, anyway. It feels like they’re extra sensitive, and it’s been making things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to the sun. I understand. That can be quite bothersome. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not like a pain, exactly. More… everything’s just brighter than it should be. And it makes me squint a lot. Even on cloudy days, sometimes. It’s been getting worse for maybe… three or four months now? I used to be able to handle the sun pretty well, but now… not so much. It's kind of scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's a discomfort, a heightened brightness, and it’s been progressively worsening over the last three to four months, even on cloudy days. And you feel a little worried about it. That’s perfectly reasonable. Just to clarify, when you say “worse,” is it affecting your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely affecting things. I work as a dental assistant, and the bright lights in the office… they really bother me now. I have to keep my sunglasses on sometimes, even inside, which isn't ideal when you're trying to, you know, do dental work. And driving is getting harder, especially in the mornings or evenings when the sun's low. I find myself avoiding going out as much, which isn't great.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's impacting your work and leisure activities, and you're finding yourself avoiding sunlight. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really pain, like I said. No blurry vision. My eyes don’t feel dry, and I haven’t seen any… floaters, or anything like that. Just the brightness. Oh! Actually… sometimes my eyes feel a little gritty, like there’s something in them, even when there isn’t. That doesn't happen all the time, just occasionally. And maybe a little bit of redness, but I figured that was just from squinting so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no blurry vision, no floaters, no dryness. Occasional grittiness and some redness likely from squinting. Good to know. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks the same, as far as I can tell. I had an eye exam a couple years ago, maybe three, with my regular doctor, and he said everything was fine then. I haven't had any problems seeing things up close or far away. I guess I should have written all this down! It’s hard to remember everything. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Arbin. It's perfectly normal to not remember everything. We can take our time and figure this out. Knowing you had a normal eye exam a few years ago is helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I’m pretty healthy, actually. I had the usual childhood things, but nothing major. I do have… well, I lost my wife a couple of years ago. That was… hard. But no ongoing health problems, no diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I take a multivitamin, that’s about it. And I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for letting me know about the Medicare. Okay, no ongoing medical conditions, just a multivitamin. Have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky. Never had anything stuck in my eye, never had any surgeries. I wear glasses for reading sometimes, just the cheap ones from the drugstore, but that’s it. And I haven’t changed any medications recently, other than starting the multivitamin a few months ago. It wasn’t to fix anything, just thought I should probably take one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no eye injuries or surgeries, just drugstore reading glasses and a recently started multivitamin. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. My wife used to make me check ingredient lists for nuts, because she was allergic, but I don't have any allergies myself. I don't even get hay fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That simplifies things. And just to be thorough, do you have any family history of eye problems - glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother had… cataracts, I think. She had surgery for them when she got older. And I think my grandfather on my father’s side… he had some trouble with his vision towards the end of his life, but I don’t know exactly what it was. No one else that I can recall having any major eye problems. I wasn’t very close to a lot of my family, so I don't know a ton about their medical history, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of cataracts in your mother and some unspecified vision problems in your grandfather. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick eye exam to get a better look at what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it’s not anything too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to shine a light into your eyes, it won't be painful, but it might be a little bright. Just look straight ahead, and try to relax. I'll start with your right eye… Okay… pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. I'm not seeing any obvious signs of macular degeneration or glaucoma. The optic nerve looks healthy. I do see some mild dryness of the conjunctiva, and a bit of redness, consistent with what you've described. Similar findings in the left eye – mild conjunctival dryness and some redness. No obvious signs of serious pathology. Your vision appears intact, though a formal visual acuity test would be more precise. So, based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it sounds like you're experiencing photophobia - sensitivity to light - likely caused by some irritation and dryness of the surface of your eyes. It’s possible the multivitamin isn’t agreeing with you, or it could simply be environmental factors, like increased sun exposure.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes… some sense. Photophobia… I think I’ve heard of that. So it’s not anything serious? Like, I'm not going blind or anything? And the multivitamin… you think that could be causing it? I just started taking it because… well, I figured it couldn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Arbin. It doesn't appear to be anything serious at all. There's no indication that you're going blind or experiencing a major eye condition. We're talking about discomfort, not a sight-threatening problem. As for the multivitamin… it’s possible. Some supplements can cause dryness or irritation as a side effect. It’s not common, but it’s not unheard of. We could try stopping it for a week or two to see if your symptoms improve. I’m going to recommend a few things. First, I'd like you to discontinue the multivitamin for two weeks and see if that makes a difference. Second, I recommend using artificial tears – over-the-counter lubricating eye drops – several times a day, even when your eyes don't feel particularly dry. And third, when you're outdoors, be sure to wear sunglasses that block 100% of UVA and UVB rays. A wide-brimmed hat can also help.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Stop the multivitamin, use the eye drops, wear sunglasses. I can definitely do that. Where can I get the eye drops? And… how often is “several times a day”? Like, every hour? I don’t want to overdo it. And are there any specific brands you recommend? I just want to make sure I get the right kind.
DOCTOR: Good questions. You can get artificial tears at any drugstore or pharmacy – they're usually located in the eye care section. As for how often, "several times a day" means about every 2-3 hours while you're awake, or as needed if your eyes feel dry or irritated. You don't need to use them every hour unless you find that’s necessary. There’s no need to overdo it, but keeping your eyes well-lubricated is important. As for brands… Systane and Refresh are both good options. They’re preservative-free, which is often better if you’re using them frequently. But any brand that’s specifically labeled as lubricating eye drops should be fine. Just avoid any that contain decongestants, like redness-reducing drops, as those can actually worsen dryness over time. I’ll write all of this down for you, along with a summary of today’s visit. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. If your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks, or if they get worse, please call the office and we’ll get you seen sooner. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Systane or Refresh, every 2-3 hours, no redness-reducing drops. And follow-up in two weeks. I think I can remember all that. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I was worried it was something serious, so… I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. And writing it down is a good idea, just in case.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. It’s my pleasure. I understand your concern, and it's always best to get things checked out. Here’s the summary. It includes all of the recommendations, as well as the appointment information for your follow-up visit. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care of your eyes! And don't forget the sunglasses! .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. And I definitely will remember the sunglasses. Have a good day to you too. .
