DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 38 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, that's right, 38. It’s… muscle weakness, mostly. Been getting worse for a few weeks now. It's making things difficult, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Muscle weakness, you say. And it’s been progressing over the last few weeks. Can you be more specific about where you’re experiencing this weakness, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: Hmm. Everywhere, kinda? But mostly in my legs and arms. Like, carrying groceries is a real effort now, and even just… walking up the stairs. It feels like they just… give out sometimes. Not completely, but… weaker than they used to be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. “Everywhere,” but primarily legs and arms. Difficulty with exertion – groceries, stairs. A sensation of “giving out.” Is this weakness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. But it's… more often bad lately. Like, last week I could barely get out of bed one morning. Then the next day, I felt almost normal. It's unpredictable. It's really frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, fluctuating weakness. Very well. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But I mean, who isn't tired these days? No pain, no numbness, no… dizziness or anything like that. Just the weakness. And the frustration, of course.
DOCTOR: No associated pain, numbness, or dizziness. Simply the weakness and… fatigue. Alright. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger this weakness, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific. Exercise doesn't make it worse, resting doesn’t always make it better. It just… happens. Honestly, it's kinda random. I wish I knew what was causing it!
DOCTOR: Random onset is… unhelpful, certainly. Now, Mr. McKinnon, I need to ask some rather routine questions. Have you had any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a couple times, like everyone else, and broke my arm when I was a kid, but nothing major. No serious diseases, no surgeries… Just the usual stuff, I guess. Nothing that would explain this.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. And family history, Mr. McKinnon?
PATIENT: My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma, on my mom's side, she had… something with her heart, I think. But honestly, I don’t know a whole lot about it. We weren’t really close, and my mom didn't talk about it much. Does that help? It’s not very specific, sorry.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your father, cardiac issues in your maternal grandmother – noted, though limited information. Now, concerning your lifestyle, Mr. McKinnon. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Don't smoke, don't drink much either, honestly. Maybe a beer or two with friends sometimes, but that's it. I try to eat healthy, but… work's stressful, so it's not always easy.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I usually just… deal with it, I guess. Don't really like the idea of putting all those chemicals in my body.
DOCTOR: No current medications. Very well. Now, I’m going to need to conduct a physical examination, Mr. McKinnon. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with your neurological function, and assess your muscle strength.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. Hope it doesn't take too long, Doctor. I got a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your arms. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels a little… strained, honestly. Not as strong as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is what I suspected. And now, against resistance. I want you to try and pull your arm away from me while I try to hold it in place.
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s… harder than it should be. Feels like I’m fighting against something. It's getting harder just to… move it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observe reduced strength bilaterally in your upper extremities. Now, let's assess your legs. Please bend your knees and try to push against my hand. I'll be right here to steady you.
PATIENT: It's… harder than it should be, Doctor. Feels like I'm lifting weights I shouldn't be able to. It's getting… harder.
DOCTOR: Yes, I concur. Reduced strength in lower extremities as well. I'm also noting a slightly diminished reflex response in both your knees and ankles. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and possibly an electromyography, or EMG, to assess nerve function. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work, okay. I guess so. An… electro-what? Sounds… complicated. What does it do? I'm not really good with medical stuff, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong, and hopefully fix it. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: An electromyography, or EMG, is a test that assesses the electrical activity in your muscles. It helps us determine if the weakness is due to a problem with the muscles themselves, or with the nerves that control them. It’s not particularly painful, though there may be some mild discomfort. Regarding your question about seriousness… it's too early to say definitively. The symptoms you're describing— progressive weakness, diminished reflexes— could be indicative of several conditions. It could be something relatively benign, such as a vitamin deficiency, or something more complex. That is why these tests are necessary. We need to gather more information before we can determine the underlying cause and formulate an appropriate treatment plan. I will also need to review your complete medical history more thoroughly.
PATIENT: Okay… I see. So, it doesn't necessarily mean it's bad? Just… need more info. Alright, let’s do the tests. The sooner we know, the better. Can I still drive after? I gotta pick up my niece later.
DOCTOR: Precisely. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a severe problem, no. Now, regarding driving… there are typically no restrictions after an EMG, but it's possible you might experience some mild muscle soreness afterward, which could affect your ability to operate a vehicle comfortably. It would depend on the extent of the test and your individual response. I recommend erring on the side of caution and arranging for alternative transportation if possible. If you must drive, please be mindful of any discomfort and stop if you feel unsafe. I’ll have the lab requisition and referral for the EMG printed for you. The lab will schedule the appointment directly. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of, before I finalize this paperwork?
PATIENT: No allergies, sir. None that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. Just… normal food. Alright, so lab will call me to schedule? And you’ll… look at the results? How long does that usually take? I really appreciate you getting this sorted quickly, Doctor. It's kinda stressful, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab will contact you directly to schedule the EMG. I will review the results as soon as they become available, typically within a week, depending on the lab’s workload. My office will then contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. It's understandable that you're feeling stressed, Mr. McKinnon. It’s always unsettling when experiencing unexplained symptoms. We will do our best to identify the cause of your weakness and provide you with the appropriate care. I'll also have the nurse provide you with a list of resources for support, should you find it helpful. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. Seriously, I appreciate it. I’ll… go get this scheduled. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
