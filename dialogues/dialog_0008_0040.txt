DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side that keeps coming back. And… I seem to get water infections quite a bit now, too. It's been going on for a while, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with this side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s usually on my right side, lower down. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. Sometimes it’s bad enough that I have trouble sleeping, but other times it's just…there. It comes and goes, you see. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes it worse, or better, really. Just…appears.
DOCTOR: Alright, and how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. I suppose… a couple of years, at least? It started off now and then, and I just put it down to getting older, you know? But it’s become more frequent lately. The water infections, too, they seem to be getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of years. And you mentioned frequent water infections – how often would you say you’re getting those?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. In the last six months, I’d say… three or four times? I have to go to the doctor and get something for them each time. It’s a bother, really. And uncomfortable, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four times in the last six months. That is quite frequent. Do you notice any particular symptoms with the water infections?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I get a burning sensation when I… well, when I go to the toilet. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even when there’s not much there. Sometimes there's a bit of blood, too. It’s not a lot, but enough to notice. And I feel quite tired afterwards. It knocks me about a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, burning with urination, frequency, and some blood… and the fatigue. Okay. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, a doctor told me I had something with my kidneys… Polycystic Kidney Disease, that’s what he called it. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. He said it means I have lots of little sacs on my kidneys. I've seen a specialist before, but that was a long time ago. I haven't really had much trouble with it until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Polycystic Kidney Disease. That explains a few things. Do you remember when you were last seen by a specialist for that?
PATIENT: Let me think… goodness, it must be… fifteen years ago, at least? Maybe longer. It was before I retired, I think. It was just a check-up, he said everything was stable and told me to come back if I had any problems. I didn’t really have any problems then, so I didn’t go back. Now, I seem to be having quite a few problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Never had any surgeries. I've always been lucky with my health, apart from this kidney business, of course. And now these water infections… and the pain. It's getting me worried, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members have any medical conditions, particularly kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother, she had high blood pressure. And my brother, he had diabetes. As for kidney problems… I don't recall anyone specifically. My father, he was quite a healthy man, lived to a good age. But my mother's side of the family… they didn’t talk much about their health, to be honest. I don't really know much about it. I was quite young when my parents passed.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just some paracetamol for the pain, when it gets bad. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were a bit low. That’s it, really. Nothing regular for anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m usually quite careful, though. I always tell the doctor if I’m trying anything new. I've never had any trouble with allergies. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and check your back for any tenderness. I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s just nice to be getting to the bottom of this, you see. I’ve been worrying about it for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your abdomen now... and gently pressing on your sides. Do you feel any pain anywhere specific when I press?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s on my right side, lower down. When you press there, it’s a bit tender. Not a sharp pain, but definitely uncomfortable. It feels… like a dull ache, a bit like the pain I’ve been getting on its own. It's not terrible, but I can feel it. There. Just there.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right lower quadrant. And your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is normal. Given your history of Polycystic Kidney Disease, the recurrent water infections, and this tenderness, I’m concerned about a possible kidney infection, or perhaps a blockage. We need to do some tests to find out for sure. I’d like to order a urine sample to check for infection, and some blood work to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. I just want to know what’s going on, and get it sorted out, you see. A urine sample and blood work… yes, that sounds good. Where do I go to do those? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample - she'll give you a container and instructions. And I'll write an order for the blood work; you can go to the lab right across the hall. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, or experience severe pain, or notice any blood in your urine, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you very much for listening, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I’ll go and see the nurse now, and then head to the lab. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Okay. You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. And please, if anything changes, go to the emergency room. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
