DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. I’m Dr. Trestrail. Now, you’re 87 years young, and it says here you’re a gentleman of Jamaican descent. That’s… interesting. But let's get down to business. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, eighty-seven years, can you believe it? And Jamaican born and bred, that’s right. What brings me in… oh, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me a bit lately.
DOCTOR: "A bit lately," you say. How long exactly is “lately,” Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think now. It started… oh, about three weeks ago, I reckon. Maybe a little over. Not every day, mind you. Some days it’s just a dull ache, others it’s a proper throb. Especially if I'm bendin' over, doin' nails, you know? It's right here, at the base of my skull.
DOCTOR: Bending over, doing nails…and it’s at the base of your skull. And you describe it as a dull ache sometimes, and a throb at other times. Has anything specific triggered these headaches – anything you were doing, eating, or thinking about before they started?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me see… No, nothin' springs to mind right away. I’ve been eatin’ the same things, doin’ the same work… I haven’t been stressin’ none, neither. Life’s pretty peaceful, thankfully. My wife, bless her heart, keeps me on the straight and narrow. No, I don’t think there was anythin’ special that started it. Just… appeared one day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the headache itself, have you noticed anything else accompanying it?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Well, now that you mention it… I have been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. Not exhausted, just… feelin’ my age a bit more, you know? And maybe a little bit dizzy sometimes when I stand up too quickly. But I put that down to gettin’ old! Happens to the best of us, I figure.
DOCTOR: “Feeling your age” is one thing, Mr. Popova, and sudden dizziness is another. Now, have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in vision… Hmm. Let me think. Not that I've noticed, Doctor. I still read my newspaper every day, though I do hold it a little further away than I used to. My wife says I should get my eyes checked, but I keep puttin' it off. Old age, you know? Things go a little blurry. It’s just… gradual, nothin’ sudden.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you experienced any fever, neck stiffness, weakness in your arms or legs, or any difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Oh no, no fever or nothin' like that! My neck feels fine, and I can move my arms and legs just as well as ever. And I can speak perfectly alright, can’t I? No trouble with my words at all, thank you very much. Definitely nothin' like that goin' on. Just this headache and a bit of tiredness.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s do a quick physical exam, Mr. Popova. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and reflexes, and I'll take a look at your eyes, ears, nose and throat. It’s just a standard check, but it’s important to rule things out. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No trouble at all. Go right ahead. I’m happy to cooperate. Always good to get things checked out, even if it's just to put your mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure is 150 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your neurological function. Follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m followin’ it, Doctor. There… and there… movin’ it nice and slow, right? I’m keepin’ my head still, just like you said. This is a bit tiring, though. Not used to focusin’ so hard on one thing.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. Strength appears normal in all extremities. Now, I'm going to shine a light in your eyes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but slightly sluggish.
PATIENT: Alright, doin' what you need me to do. Bit bright, that light, Doctor. But I’m lookin’ straight ahead, doin’ my best. Sluggish, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: "Sluggish" simply means they react a little slower than expected, Mr. Popova. It's not necessarily bad, but it's something I need to investigate further. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I suspect this could be related to a few different things. It could be tension headaches, but the sluggish pupils and the dizziness are concerning enough that I want to rule out more serious causes. I'd like to order a CT scan of your head. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Allergies… hmm. Let me think now. I don’t think I have any allergies, but my wife, bless her heart, always does the medical history stuff. She's the organized one. I haven't had any injections or anything in years, so I wouldn’t know. I suppose it's best to be safe, though. Contrast dye… what does that do, exactly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: The contrast dye helps us see the structures in your brain more clearly on the scan, Mr. Popova. It’s administered intravenously – a small needle in your arm. There is a small risk of allergic reaction, which is why I’m asking. It can sometimes cause a warm sensation or a metallic taste in your mouth. As for the scan itself, it’s painless. You’ll simply lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. Given your age and these symptoms, I think it’s a necessary precaution. I will need a detailed medical history from your wife. Do you know if she has that readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, my wife always has everything organized. She keeps a file, a proper file, with all my medical records, test results, everything. It’s in the blue binder, on the kitchen table. She’ll be happy to give you all the details. I just… I don’t like hospitals and scans and needles, you know? But I understand you’re just doin’ your job, and I trust your judgment, Doctor. Go ahead and order the scan. And tell my wife to expect a phone call. She’ll know what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. I'm ordering the CT scan now, and I’ll have my nurse contact your wife to schedule it. I’m also going to write a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help with the headache in the meantime. It's unlikely to solve the underlying problem, but it may provide some temporary relief. I’d like to see you back here in one week to discuss the scan results. If your headache worsens significantly, or you experience any new symptoms – weakness, vision changes, difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: One week… alright. Pain reliever sounds good, thank you. No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Just… try not to keep us waitin’ too long for the results, alright? My wife and I are both a bit worried, naturally. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, even with the scan. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Popova. My nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
