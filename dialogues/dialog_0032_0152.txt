DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s… rather unusual to see someone your age presenting with a complaint, frankly, but we shall proceed. Please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise, if you would. My time is… valuable.
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. That’s… a bit direct, isn’t it? But alright. I got a letter from the lab. Said my cholesterol is high. Hyperlipidemia, I think it was called. The doctor at the lab said I should come see someone about it, so here I am. It’s not something I feel sick about, if that makes any sense. Just… a number on a paper.
DOCTOR: “Just a number on a paper,” you say. Hmm. While I appreciate your… optimism, Ms. Geho, those numbers are indicative of a process occurring within your body, regardless of whether you feel anything. Hyperlipidemia is a concern. We don't wait for symptoms to manifest, that's generally poor practice. Now, let’s get some clarification. Do you recall the specific numbers reported on this lab result?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I do have the paper somewhere. Just a moment… I keep everything, you see. Bills, grocery lists, things the grandkids draw… ah, here we are. Let me see… Total cholesterol was 245, I think. LDL was 160… HDL was… 45? And triglycerides were 180. Does that ring any bells? I didn't really understand what any of it meant, to be honest. They just said “high.”
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers are… suboptimal, Ms. Geho. Quite suboptimal. A total cholesterol of 245 is elevated. Your LDL, at 160, is particularly concerning – that’s the “bad” cholesterol, as it’s commonly referred. HDL at 45 is…acceptable, but not ideal, and triglycerides are borderline elevated. Now, have you had your cholesterol checked before?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I think… maybe once? A long time ago. When I was still working, probably. The company made us get yearly physicals. But that was… oh, goodness, at least ten years ago, maybe more. I honestly don't remember the numbers then. Everything was fine then, I suppose. I never thought much about it after that. Mostly, I just try to eat reasonably and not worry too much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Reasonably” is…subjective, Ms. Geho. And infrequent monitoring can easily miss the insidious onset of these processes. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Let me think… No diabetes, no. My blood pressure is usually pretty good, the nurse always says when I get my flu shot. Heart disease… not that I know of. My father had some problems with his heart when he got older, but I don't think I inherited anything. And no, no thyroid problems either. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life, honestly. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s…adequate, Ms. Geho. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… oh, yes! I broke my wrist once, when I was learning to roller skate. That was a bit of a mess, but it healed up alright. Other than that… no, I don't think so. No hospital stays, no major surgeries. I've always been careful. I don't like doctors or hospitals, if I'm being honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Aversion to preventative care is… common, Ms. Geho, though not particularly helpful. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 88, and she was pretty healthy until the very end. She did have some arthritis, but that runs in the family, I think. My father, as I mentioned, had some heart trouble later in life – angina, I believe. He had to watch his diet and take some medication. My brother, he’s still alive and kicking, but he has high blood pressure, so that seems to be a thing on our side of the family. And… oh, yes! My aunt on my mother’s side had a stroke a few years ago. Does any of that help? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: It’s… sufficient, Ms. Geho. A family history of cardiovascular disease, even indirectly, is noteworthy. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I can't stand the smell of it. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and she was right. Both my parents smoked when they were young, but they quit a long time ago. They both had terrible coughs later in life, and I think that was the reason. So, no, never smoked, and I don't spend time around people who do. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Adequate. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Nothing excessive, I promise. Mostly red wine, they say it’s good for your heart. Just a small glass, to relax. And sometimes, at parties, I’ll have a little champagne. But honestly, I don’t drink very much. It doesn’t really agree with me. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: “Reasonable” is… subjective, Ms. Geho. While moderate red wine consumption is often cited as having potential benefits, it doesn’t negate the other risk factors present. Now, let's discuss your diet. Describe a typical day of eating for me. Be specific.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific… well, let me think. Usually, for breakfast, I have a bowl of oatmeal with some fruit – blueberries, usually, or sometimes bananas. And a cup of coffee, of course. For lunch, I often have a sandwich – turkey or ham on whole wheat bread, with lettuce and tomato. And maybe a side salad. For dinner… that varies. Sometimes I’ll have chicken, roasted with vegetables – broccoli, carrots, potatoes. Other times I’ll have fish – salmon or cod. And I always try to have a side of green vegetables. I do enjoy a little bit of cheese with my meals, and sometimes I’ll have a small dessert – a piece of fruit, or a cookie. I try to eat healthy, honestly. I don’t eat a lot of processed foods or sugary drinks. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: “Healthy” is… a relative term, Ms. Geho. While the components are acceptable, the frequency and quantities are relevant. Now, one final question regarding lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Regularly… that’s a tough one. I used to walk a lot more when I was working, but now… I try to get out and walk when the weather is nice. Maybe two or three times a week, for about half an hour each time. And I do some light gardening – weeding, planting flowers, that sort of thing. It’s not very strenuous, but it keeps me moving. And I do some stretching exercises in the morning, to keep my joints flexible. Is that enough? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, while I appreciate your… transparency, it’s becoming clear that a constellation of factors – family history, diet, and limited exercise – are contributing to your elevated cholesterol levels. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. It’s standard procedure. May I listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I'm not really fond of doctors' exams, but if it’s necessary… go ahead. I suppose I should have expected it. I just… don’t enjoy being poked and prodded. But if it will help… please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Geho. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds are… normal, though a slight murmur is present. I will document that. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Normal bowel sounds present. Physical exam findings are largely unremarkable. However, given your cholesterol levels and risk factors, I recommend initiating a statin medication to lower your LDL cholesterol. We can start with a low dose and monitor your response. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A medication? Oh dear. I… I don't really like the idea of taking a medication every day. Are you sure it’s necessary? I mean, couldn't I just try to eat healthier and exercise more? I’m willing to make an effort, honestly. I’ve always been… hesitant about taking pills. Are there any… side effects? I’ve heard terrible stories about statins. I'm not sure I want to start taking a medication right away.
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, while dietary and lifestyle modifications are always beneficial, they are often insufficient to achieve the necessary reduction in LDL cholesterol, particularly given your existing levels and familial predisposition. Delaying treatment is… imprudent. Statins are generally well-tolerated. Common side effects are mild – muscle aches, occasional digestive upset. Rare, but more serious side effects do occur, but are uncommon. I will, of course, monitor your liver function and creatine kinase levels regularly to ensure your safety. We can begin with a low dose of atorvastatin, 10mg daily. It is significantly more effective than solely relying on lifestyle changes. Are you willing to trial this course of treatment, with appropriate monitoring?
PATIENT: Oh… atorvastatin… 10mg… I… I don't know. It just… seems so drastic. And having to come back for regular tests… It’s a lot. I just want to feel better, and I was hoping I could do it myself, with a bit of effort. Is there… is there any other option? A different medication, maybe? Or… a special diet? I've heard about garlic and red yeast rice… could those help? I’m just really hesitant about starting a medication, if you understand. It feels like… a last resort.
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, while garlic and red yeast rice may offer marginal benefits, they are not a substitute for established pharmacological therapy. Relying on unsubstantiated remedies is… unwise. Other statins are available, but atorvastatin is generally considered the most effective and well-tolerated. We can discuss alternative statins if you absolutely insist, but I strongly advise against delaying treatment further. The monitoring – a simple blood test every six months – is a necessary precaution, not an imposition. It allows us to assess your response and ensure your safety. Ultimately, the decision is yours. However, I must reiterate that delaying treatment will only increase your risk of cardiovascular events. Are you willing to trial the atorvastatin, with regular monitoring, or would you prefer to continue with solely lifestyle modifications, fully acknowledging the associated risks?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Alright, I suppose. If you really think it’s necessary… Atorvastatin… 10mg… every day… and the blood tests… Yes, alright. I’ll try it. But please, please be careful. And keep a close eye on me. I just… I don’t want anything to go wrong. And… will I need a special prescription? And how long will it take to see if it’s working? I just feel so… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Geho. I will write a prescription for atorvastatin 10mg, to be taken daily with your evening meal. It typically takes 4-6 weeks to assess the initial response. We will repeat your lipid panel in six weeks. I will also provide you with a list of potential side effects and instructions for reporting any concerns. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to review your results. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For… explaining everything. And for being patient with me. I know I'm probably being silly, but I just… I don’t like taking medications. I suppose I should go get the prescription filled, then. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Geho. Simply obtain your prescription and begin the medication as directed. Report any unusual symptoms – muscle pain, digestive upset – immediately. I trust you will adhere to the treatment plan. A nurse will escort you to the exit. Thank you for your time.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Hopefully, this will all work out. .
