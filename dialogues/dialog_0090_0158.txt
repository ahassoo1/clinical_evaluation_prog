DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s about this…letter. For a pet, you see? Some place needs a letter saying I can have a pet. I don’t even remember why they need it, to be frank. It’s all a bit of a blur. I just know someone said I needed to come here. It’s probably for a dog, or a cat… something small, I think.
DOCTOR: A letter for pet ownership… Right. And you received this letter…from whom, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It was… a form, really. Online. One of those apartment places, I reckon? Or maybe a homeowner’s association? They all blend together, you know? Lots of rules. It had a space for a doctor's signature. That's all I remember, really. Honestly, these things should be simpler. Why does a doctor need to be involved in a pet?
DOCTOR: Well, some landlords or associations request a statement confirming a patient's emotional or mental health stability, particularly if there’s a concern about potential disruptions or allergies. It’s… a precaution, I suppose. Do you have any history of allergies, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, I don't think so. I mean, I sneeze sometimes, like everyone does. But nothing…severe. Not like, can't breathe or anything. I've never had to carry one of those EpiPen things. Honestly, I just want to get this letter and be done with it. It's all so… bureaucratic. Is that a word?
DOCTOR: Bureaucratic is certainly a word. Alright. And just to clarify, are you seeking this letter for an emotional support animal, or… is this simply a requirement for owning any pet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Emotional support…? No, no, I don’t need an emotional support animal. I just want a dog, or a cat. A regular pet! A companion. I don't have any…problems, if that's what you're asking. They just want a letter, that’s all. It's probably just to make sure I'll clean up after it or something. I really don't understand why a doctor needs to sign off on a pet.
DOCTOR: So, to be clear, this is a standard pet ownership requirement, not related to any specific medical condition?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. That’s it! A regular pet. I want a fluffy thing to sit with and watch television. That's all. Not for therapy, not for allergies, just… a pet. Honestly, this is becoming ridiculous. Can we just… get the letter? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I can certainly document that you have no known medical conditions that would preclude pet ownership. However, it’s my professional responsibility to ensure I have a complete understanding of your health status. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Chronic… illnesses? Well, I get a little tired sometimes. Doesn’t everyone? And my knees ache when it rains. But that's just… getting older, isn't it? I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I don't go to the doctor much, to be honest. Everything feels like a lot of fuss. Is this really necessary for a pet?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while I understand your frustration, I need to ask about your mental health history as well. Have you ever been diagnosed with or treated for depression, anxiety, or any other psychological condition?
PATIENT: Oh, now hold on. Are you implying something, Doctor? I may be a little forgetful, but I am perfectly… stable. I don’t need to be psychoanalyzed to get a dog! Honestly, this is becoming quite insulting. I just want a letter. Is this some kind of trick? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I apologize if my questions have offended you. However, it is standard medical practice to gather a complete health history before providing any documentation. Given your reluctance to provide this information, and without a clear understanding of your overall health status, I am unable to fulfill your request for this letter. I recommend you consult with your primary care physician, or seek a specialist referral if you feel this is necessary for pet ownership. I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable companion. .
