DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… funny, really. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full awful quick. Even a little bit of food fills me up, and it’s not a comfortable feeling, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Getting full quickly, even with small amounts of food...and it's been happening for about a month. That’s good information. Can you describe what that uncomfortable feeling is like?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not exactly pain, not like a stomach ache. It’s more… a pressure, I guess. Right here, under my ribs. Like something’s… full, but not in a good way. And it kinda stays for a while, even if I just had a few bites. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure under the ribs… that's helpful. And it lingers, even with a small amount of food. Does anything specifically trigger it, or does it seem to happen with any type of food?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I don’t think it’s any one thing, really. I’ve tried eating lighter meals, heavier meals… doesn’t seem to matter much. Soup, roast chicken, even just a piece of toast… same thing. It just feels like I don’t have much room, no matter what it is. It’s… frustrating. I used to have a good appetite.
DOCTOR: Right, so it doesn't seem to be related to a specific food type, which is good to know. And you’ve noticed a change from your usual appetite. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this – like nausea, vomiting, heartburn, or any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thank goodness. A bit of heartburn now and then, but I’ve always had that, especially if I lie down too soon after eating. My… well, let’s just say things are regular, if you know what I mean. No changes there. It's mostly just this feeling of being full too fast. It's… a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no vomiting, regular bowel movements, and just occasional heartburn. That's good information. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a thought. My wife, Elsie, she's always saying I’m getting thinner, but I figured that was just getting older. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that’s for sure. I suppose… maybe a few pounds. Not a lot, but… yeah, I think she’s right. It's been gradual, though. Hard to say exactly how much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss… gradual, but noticeable to your wife. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years back now. Apart from that… nothing major, I don’t think. A bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just old age creeping up. I see a rheumatologist for that now and then. No diabetes, no heart trouble… Elsie keeps a close eye on me, so I think she'd know if there was something seriously wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed thirty years ago, and some arthritis. Elsie sounds very attentive. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis pills, Doctor. Something for the pain, and another one for swelling. Elsie handles the refills, so I’m not even sure what they’re called. And sometimes, if my hands are really bad, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. Nothing else, really. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medications and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. Elsie always checks when she gets new medications for me. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, though I'm not a big fan of oysters. But that's just a preference, not an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had trouble with her stomach, some kind of… ulcers, I think. She was always complaining about heartburn. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it. Elsie might know more, she’s always been good with family history. We’re Haida, you know, and our records weren’t always the best kept.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother had stomach issues and father had high blood pressure. Thank you for sharing that. Alright, Mr. Obarr, based on what you’ve told me, the feeling of fullness quickly, the weight loss, and your history, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you don't mind if I listen to your abdomen. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Okay… and another deep breath. I’m not hearing any immediately concerning sounds. The abdomen is soft to the touch, though a little tenderness in the upper quadrant, as you mentioned. No masses or distention that I can feel. Your heart sounds are regular. I also note some mild swelling in your hands, consistent with your arthritis. Okay. Based on this preliminary exam, and your history, it could be a number of things. It’s difficult to say for sure without further testing. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to check your organ function. I'm also going to order a stool test to rule out any infections. And given your weight loss, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be prudent to get a better look at your organs. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Wow, that's… a lot of tests. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, a CT scan sounds… intense. I'm not really a fan of hospitals, if you know what I mean. Elsie will be worried sick. And what exactly will these tests show? I’m not very good with medical things. Can you explain it a little simpler?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr. It is a lot of tests, and I apologize for that. It's better to be thorough, though, to get a clear picture of what's going on. The CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your organs – your stomach, liver, pancreas, intestines – to look for anything unusual like tumors, inflammation, or blockages. The blood tests will tell us how well your organs are functioning – your liver, kidneys, pancreas – and if there are any signs of infection or anemia. The stool test is to make sure there isn’t anything going on in your digestive system. I’m not trying to scare you, but the weight loss is the biggest concern, and the tests are simply to rule out anything serious. It could be something relatively minor, like a digestive issue or an ulcer, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities first. I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Especially the CT scan. What exactly does it involve? Do I have to… you know… drink anything awful? And how long does it take? I’m also a bit worried about radiation. Elsie always says I shouldn’t have too many X-rays. And… what if they find something? I’m probably just being silly, but it’s all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Mr. Obarr. These are perfectly reasonable questions, and I’m happy to answer them. The CT scan itself is relatively painless and doesn’t take long. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s important to lie very still during the scan so the images aren’t blurry. Depending on the scan ordered, you may need to drink a contrast solution beforehand, which tastes a little chalky, but it's not awful. This helps to highlight your digestive organs so we can see them more clearly. The scan itself usually takes about 15-30 minutes. Regarding radiation, you’re right to be concerned. The CT scan does involve some radiation exposure, but it’s a relatively low dose, and the benefits of getting a clear diagnosis usually outweigh the risks. We use the lowest possible dose to get the information we need. We’ll document your exposure to ensure we don’t overdo it. And if we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious. It could be something that’s easily treatable. If we find anything concerning, we’ll discuss it with you in detail, explain your options, and come up with a plan together. We might refer you to a specialist, like a gastroenterologist, for further evaluation. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's focus on getting the tests scheduled. Do you have a preferred hospital or imaging center?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little better, actually. Knowing what to expect helps. Elsie usually takes me to City General. It’s close to our house, and she knows her way around. She’d probably want to come with me for the scan, if that’s alright? She worries about me, you know. And she’s good at asking questions. I sometimes forget things. So, City General is fine. When do you think we could schedule it? And… how long does it usually take to get the results back?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, City General is fine. And absolutely, Elsie is welcome to come with you – having someone there for support is a great idea. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, contact City General to schedule the CT scan for you. She’ll work with you to find a time that’s convenient. It usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back. Once I have them, I’ll call you right away to schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not making me feel silly for asking so many questions. I feel a bit better knowing what to expect. Elsie will be relieved too. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It’s my job to answer your questions and make sure you feel comfortable. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you think of anything else. Sarah will be in touch shortly to schedule the CT scan. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
