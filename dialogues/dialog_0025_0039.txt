DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Fourney. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol was a bit high, so here I am. It's just... numbers, really. I don't even know what is high, to be honest. My wife, bless her, always handled the doctor stuff. It’s been a couple years since she passed, and I guess I’m just getting around to things now.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see the results here. Numbers are important, you’re right about that. It’s good you came in to discuss them. “A bit high” is vague, though, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It is. Very vague. She always said things like “within the normal range” or “slightly elevated”... I never pushed for specifics. Always trusted her to know. What is too high, then? And what does it even mean if it is? Is it something serious? I’ve been feeling alright, I suppose. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: Well, "feeling alright" is a good starting point, but cholesterol isn’t something you necessarily feel. It's a fat-like substance in your blood, and too much of certain types can build up in your arteries and cause… problems. We measure it in milligrams per deciliter. Ideally, your total cholesterol should be under 200. Your LDL – that's the “bad” cholesterol – should be under 100. And your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – should be 60 or higher. What were your numbers, according to this lab report?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers again. Let me see… Hmm... Total is 245. LDL is 160. And HDL… 45. Is that… bad? I knew I shouldn’t have had that extra piece of pie last week. But it was a good pie. Blueberry.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bohnett, those numbers are… elevated. Significantly. The LDL is the biggest concern right now. That’s what contributes to plaque buildup. The HDL is a little low, which isn't ideal either, but we can address that. Pie, while delicious, isn’t helping. Now, do you have any history of heart disease in your family?
PATIENT: Heart disease… my father, yes. He had a bad heart, always complaining of chest pains. He passed away when he was 78, I think. From a heart attack, they said. My mother, she lived to be 92, very healthy woman, never a sick day in her life, as far as I know. She walked everywhere. Always said walking was the best medicine. But she didn’t eat pie, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so there’s a family history of heart disease, which puts you at higher risk. Given your numbers, your age, and your father’s history, we need to take this seriously. Have you ever been on any medications for cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said, my wife always handled the doctor visits. She would explain everything, make sure I took the right pills… I just showed up and did what she said. Now that she’s gone… well, it’s all a bit overwhelming. I don’t even know what kind of pills they give for this. Do they have side effects? I read something about those once, made me nervous.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Mr. Bohnett, and it's perfectly understandable to be nervous about medication. There are different types of medications, called statins, that are very effective at lowering cholesterol. They can have side effects, like muscle aches, but most people tolerate them well. We would start with a low dose and monitor you closely. Before we jump to medication, though, let’s talk about lifestyle changes. Are you active?
PATIENT: Active… not as much as I used to be. I used to do a lot of gardening, but it's hard on my knees now. I walk to the store sometimes, a little ways, but not every day. Mostly, I sit and read. Or watch TV. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy my sweets. Like we discussed, that pie was particularly good. My wife always baked for me. It's hard to change old habits, you know? Especially when they're tied to good memories.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. Habits are difficult to break, especially those with emotional significance. However, given your numbers and family history, relying solely on lifestyle changes may not be sufficient. We need to consider medication to protect your heart. Before we decide on a course of action, I'd like to order a few more blood tests. A complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel, just to rule out any other contributing factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests again? Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgement. It’s just… I don’t like feeling like a science experiment. But if it’ll help, I’ll do it. When will I get the results? And will I need to come back again soon? I have a book club meeting next week, and I don’t want to miss it. It’s a good one, a mystery.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bohnett. It’s not a pleasant experience, but it’s necessary information. The lab results should be back in about a week. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. We can definitely work around your book club meeting. A mystery sounds… enjoyable. Hopefully, we can solve your cholesterol puzzle before the mystery is solved. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. My wife always kept track of that sort of thing too. Wait… I think I got a rash once, years ago, after taking some antibiotic for a sore throat. But I don't remember what it was called. Just a little itchy. It went away after a few days. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. So many tests, so many numbers… It’s a lot to take in. Perhaps I should have just stuck to pie.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bohnett. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’re just trying to gather all the information we need to make the best decision for your health. The rash is good to know, we'll make a note of that. And while pie is certainly enjoyable, it’s not a substitute for a healthy heart. Let’s just focus on getting these tests done and then we can talk about a plan, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests, then a plan. That sounds… manageable. Where do I go for the tests? And do I need to fast beforehand? My wife always said something about fasting, but I can’t remember the details. She was very particular about those things. This is all so frustrating. I just want to be healthy, you know? And maybe enjoy a piece of pie now and then. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bohnett, that’s not too much to ask at all. We can definitely work towards that. You'll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. No food or drinks except water. The lab is just down the hall, Room 203. My nurse will give you a requisition form and instructions. She's very helpful. And yes, a piece of pie is perfectly acceptable with a well-managed plan. We’ll get you there. Now, do you have any questions before I let you go?
