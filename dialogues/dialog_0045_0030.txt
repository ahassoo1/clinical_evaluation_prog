DOCTOR: Alright, Kerriann Purtee, 49 years old. Good. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed… a change in my body odor. It’s not… normal for me. I always smelled… clean, you know? Now it’s… different. Not bad, exactly, just… not me. It started maybe a couple of weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… Okay. And you say this started about two weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, but I remember thinking something was off around then. I hadn’t changed anything – no new soaps, deodorants, or anything like that. I eat pretty much the same things, too. I just… woke up one morning and it was different. It’s mostly noticeable after I’ve been working, you know, laying floors. A lot of physical work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Laying floors, so you're physically active. And no changes to your hygiene products or diet. Hmm. Okay. Now, are you noticing this odor all the time, or just after exertion, like you said?
PATIENT: Mostly after exertion, yeah. Like after a long day at a job site, or even a really good gardening session. It’s not constant. I don't really smell it sitting around the house. But if I get warm, or sweaty… that’s when I notice it. It’s just… unsettling, because I always used to be able to work all day and not worry about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes sense. You're noticing a change from your baseline. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no chills. No weight loss that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been feeling sick, exactly. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just the heat. I've been sleeping okay, I guess. No skin changes where I sweat, nothing like a rash or anything. Oh! And no new medications. I only take something for my blood pressure, and I’ve been on that for years.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, years on it. Okay. And no fever, chills, weight loss, skin changes. Just the fatigue, which you attribute to the heat. Right. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sweat itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the sweat… hmm. That’s a good question. I… I don’t know. It feels the same, if that makes sense. Like, it’s still sweat. Not thicker, not a different color, not… smellier before the body odor change. It’s just… the odor that’s different after it happens. I’m trying to think if it feels stickier or anything, but… no, I don’t think so. It’s just sweat, honestly. I really don’t know what’s going on. It’s just… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's unsettling when your body changes, and you can't explain it. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it. And I broke my wrist once, but that was years ago, and it healed fine. No major illnesses, like anything serious. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing that needed hospitalisation or anything. My blood pressure’s been managed for about ten years now, too. That’s been pretty stable. I try to eat healthy and stay active when I can. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, broken wrist, managed hypertension for ten years. Good. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had diabetes, but she managed it pretty well. My father had high blood pressure too, like me. And my sister has arthritis, but that's about it. Nothing really… unusual. Nobody's had anything… smell-related, if that makes sense! It's just me. They’re both still alive, thankfully. My mother is 82, my sister is 60.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant smell-related issues in the family. Now, let’s talk about social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. I always thought it was a terrible habit. I try to stay away from it as much as possible, even being around people who smoke bothers me. And I don't drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that’s about it. I don’t really go out much, mostly just work and spend time in the garden. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. No smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat pretty much everything. I used to get a little itchy when I was a kid around certain flowers, but I haven't had that problem in years. Nothing serious, honestly. I've always been pretty lucky in that department. I’m not one for taking a lot of risks with food, so I stick to things I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Kerriann, this is… unusual. Given your history, it’s unlikely to be something immediately serious, but a change in body odor can be indicative of underlying issues. I want to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Anything to figure out what’s going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, honestly. It felt silly even talking about it at first, but it’s been bothering me a lot. A physical exam sounds like a good idea. What will you be looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin, especially in areas where you sweat. We'll also do a brief neurological exam. I’m mainly looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or anything else that might be causing the change in odor. It’s a standard check, and hopefully, we’ll get some answers. Please have a seat on the exam table.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. I hope it's nothing serious. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Sounds clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is stable. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. No obvious rashes, lesions, or signs of infection. Do you notice any tenderness in your armpits or groin area?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little sore after a long day of work, just from the physical exertion, but nothing unusual. It feels pretty much the same as always. I do get a little chafing sometimes, but that’s just from the clothes and the sweating. Nothing major. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: I'm checking for any swelling of the lymph nodes. They feel normal at the moment. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Okay. Based on the physical exam, I don’t see any immediate cause for concern, but I'd like to order some blood work just to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure out what's going on. Blood work is fine. What kind of things will they be checking for? Is it anything serious?
DOCTOR: We'll check your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and glucose levels. It's a pretty standard panel, just to get a baseline and rule out any common causes of body odor changes. Things like diabetes, kidney or liver issues, or thyroid problems can sometimes cause changes in body odor. It doesn’t mean you have any of those, but it's best to rule them out. It's unlikely to be something serious, Kerriann, but we need to be thorough. Here's the lab order. You can take this to the lab attached to the clinic, and they’ll take care of it. They'll need a blood sample. Do you have any questions about the order?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That sounds… reasonable. Kidney and liver, thyroid… okay. And it's just to rule things out. Alright. I can definitely do that. How long will it take to get the results back? And what happens after that?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. You can access them through the patient portal on our website, or we can give you a call with the results. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, continue to monitor your body odor and let us know if it worsens or if you develop any other symptoms. If you experience a fever, chills, or any significant changes in your overall health, please contact us immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. I’ll definitely keep an eye on things, and I’ll check the patient portal. 2-3 business days… okay. I’ll just try not to worry too much in the meantime. Thank you, Dr. Billman. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what’s going on. I feel a little better just knowing we’re doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Kerriann. I understand it can be unsettling when your body changes, and I'm glad we're working together to find answers. It's always best to be proactive about your health. I've documented everything we discussed today, including your history, physical exam findings, and the blood work order. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if anything changes, don't hesitate to call. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Dr. Billman. Thank you again. I’ll go get the blood work done and check the portal. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. Take care, and have a good day as well. We’ll be in touch soon. .
