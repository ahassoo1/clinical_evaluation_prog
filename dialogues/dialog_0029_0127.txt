DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Chora. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, just generally. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, slowly getting worse. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness and drooping eyelids over a few weeks… that is concerning, and good you came in to get it checked out. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say "weaker," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… it's not like I can’t do things, but it takes more effort. Especially things like… lifting things, or even just holding my head up for a long time. And climbing stairs is much harder now. It’s like my muscles get tired very quickly. It started in my arms, I think, and now it's in my legs too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, weakness progressively worsening, starting in the arms and now in the legs… and requiring more effort for everyday activities. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… more tired than usual, I suppose. But I always thought that was just… life. And, now that you mention it, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so I assumed it was just my prescription needing an update. I haven't noticed anything else… not that I can recall, anyway. Is blurry vision something to worry about in this case?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and blurry vision… we’ll definitely keep those in mind. Blurry vision can be related, yes, and we need to explore that further. Now, let's go through some more general questions. Do you have any problems with double vision at all?
PATIENT: Double vision? No, not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems… single, if that makes sense. I mean, I haven’t seen two of anything. Just the usual blurriness sometimes, especially when I’m tired. I haven’t been doing anything different lately that would explain it, so it’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know about the double vision. Unsettling is a fair way to put it. Let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and such, but nothing serious. I haven’t been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. My doctor back in Sweden always said I was a perfectly healthy young man. I… I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since I moved here, though. Things just got… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses, childhood illnesses only. It's good you were generally healthy before. And I understand things can get complicated when moving to a new country. Have you had any surgeries at all, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven’t had any operations, not even to remove wisdom teeth or anything like that. I… I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. My teeth are still all my own, much to the dentist’s surprise. Is that… relevant? I feel like I'm rambling a bit. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Mr. Schaust. It's good to know. No surgeries, excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My… my parents are both deceased, unfortunately. And I wasn’t very close to my extended family. I know my mother had… arthritis, I think, when she was older, but that’s about all I can recall. I don’t know if anyone else had anything significant. I wish I knew more, but it's… a bit of a blank. Does that make things difficult?
DOCTOR: It makes things a little more challenging, yes, but we can still work with that. Thank you for sharing what you know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and I definitely don’t use any drugs. I… I’ve always been very careful about my health, as I said. I try to eat a balanced diet and get enough sleep, though it’s been harder lately with… everything. It's just… stressful being divorced, you know? I don't want to bring that up, but it impacts sleep.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schaust. It's good to know about the lifestyle factors, and I understand that stress can certainly impact sleep. And it's perfectly okay to mention things that are relevant to your health. Now, just a few more general questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I’ve taken various medications over the years for colds and flu, without any problems. My ex-wife is the one with allergies, she’s allergic to… everything, it seemed. But I've always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, excellent. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything at all currently. Not even vitamins. I stopped taking a multivitamin a few months ago, just… couldn't be bothered, to be honest. I haven’t needed anything, or at least I didn’t think I did until… well, until now. Is that all the questions, Doctor? I feel like I’ve been rambling for ages.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s good. No, that’s all the questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Mr. Schaust. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready whenever you are. I hope you can find something out. I'm just… worried, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your worry. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. I'll also take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I’ll check your strength and reflexes. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning at the moment. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I'm noting some mild ptosis – that's the drooping of your eyelids that you mentioned. Your reflexes are normal. Strength is… a bit diminished in your arms and legs, particularly with sustained effort. Okay, everything seems normal so far, but the ptosis and diminished strength are concerning. I want to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Blood tests sound… sensible. If it helps you figure out what’s wrong, then please do. I… I just want to know what’s happening. It’s unsettling not knowing. What kind of blood tests are you thinking of, if you don’t mind me asking? I'm not afraid of needles, but it's just… nice to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand wanting to know what to expect. I’m going to order a complete blood count – that checks your red and white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin. We’ll also check your electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D levels. And, importantly, I want to check for something called acetylcholine receptor antibodies. It’s a bit technical, but it can help rule out a condition called Myasthenia Gravis, which can cause weakness and drooping eyelids. It's not saying you have it, but it's important to rule it out. The phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It usually takes just a few minutes. The results will take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – particularly any difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… thorough. And understandable, even the technical part. Acetylcholine receptor antibodies… I’ll try to remember that. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. A couple of days… I can manage that. And yes, I understand about the emergency room. I will definitely go if things get worse. Difficulty breathing or swallowing… noted. So, the phlebotomist will call me to schedule the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Yes, the phlebotomist will call you to schedule the blood work. And yes, you do need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – no food or drinks other than water. In the meantime, there’s nothing specific you need to avoid, but I recommend getting plenty of rest and avoiding strenuous activity. Try not to overexert yourself, and pay attention to your body. If you notice your symptoms getting worse, please don't hesitate to call the office. I’m also going to send you home with a handout explaining Myasthenia Gravis, just so you have some information to review. It's not a diagnosis, just informational. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Okay, 8 hours fasting, noted. I will definitely remember that this time. And plenty of rest, avoid strenuous activity… I can manage that. I think I’ve got it. A handout about Myasthenia Gravis… that’s very thoughtful, thank you. I appreciate that. Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. You’ve explained everything so clearly, and I feel a little… less anxious now, if that makes sense. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for ordering the tests. I appreciate it more than you know. I guess I'll wait for the phlebotomist’s call then. And try to get some rest. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I understand your anxiety, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, get some rest. I'll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day.
