DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, most of ‘em. But… well, I’ve been, uh… losing blood. Not a small amount either. It’s coming from… down there. Let's just say it's not pleasant. Happened a couple times now, and it’s getting worse. I'm Brad, by the way. Brad Gentz.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Brad. It takes courage to seek medical attention, and I appreciate you sharing this with me, despite your reservations. It's good we're addressing this. “Down there” – you mean rectal bleeding?
PATIENT: Rectal bleeding, yeah, that’s… a polite way to put it. Look, I’m a simple man, Doctor. I run a crematory. I deal with… finished things all day, alright? I don't need fancy words. It’s blood. Comes out when I… use the bathroom. It’s dark, almost black, sometimes. And it’s not just a little spot, if you catch my drift. It's enough to worry a fella.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. And you’re right to be concerned. Dark, almost black stool suggests the blood may be partially digested, meaning it's coming from higher up in the digestive tract. We need to investigate this to determine the source. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start. Let me think. It's been… oh, maybe three, four weeks now? Started kinda gradual, just a little smear on the paper, didn't think much of it. Figured it was somethin' I ate. But then it started happenin' more often. And the amount… well, it’s definitely increased. Last couple times, it was… noticeable. Enough to make me a little lightheaded, to be honest. I haven’t told anyone, mind you. Waste of their time.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks, starting gradually and increasing in amount, now to the point of causing lightheadedness. That is important information. The lightheadedness is something we need to pay attention to, as it could indicate some blood loss. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, my stomach’s been a bit… unsettled. Not like a full-blown ache, more like a constant churning. And I’ve been… tired. Real tired. Thought it was just the heat, to be honest. It’s been brutal this summer. But it’s not goin’ away, this tiredness. And… I guess I haven’t been as hungry as usual. Food just doesn't appeal like it used to. I've lost a bit of weight, probably. Don’t weigh myself, though. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unsettled stomach, constant churning, fatigue, and decreased appetite with some weight loss. These all could be related to the bleeding, Brad. We need to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any pain in your abdomen, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Never vomited in my life, not even as a kid. And pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… discomfort. A dull ache, sometimes, but it comes and goes. It's not sharp, nothin' that would send me rushin' to the hospital or anything. I just… feel generally unwell, if that makes sense. Like somethin’s off. And frankly, I don’t like feelin’ like this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Brad. A general feeling of being unwell is a valid concern. Okay, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmph. Not much to tell ya, doc. I've been lucky, I guess. Never had much use for doctors, as I said. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no high blood pressure. I had a bout of the flu when I was a kid, maybe. And… well, my wife, God rest her soul, she passed away five years ago. Cancer. Took her quick. That’s about it. Never been much of a sickly man.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Brad. That must have been very difficult. And it’s good to know you haven’t had any significant medical issues in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed ‘em. I've always been careful, kept to myself, didn't do nothin' foolish. My wife always said I was too stubborn to even go to the dentist regularly, let alone get cut open. She was probably right. Look, I appreciate you askin', doc, but I’m not a complicated case. Just an old man with a bit of blood comin’ out where it shouldn’t.
DOCTOR: You're right, Brad, and I appreciate your honesty. But even a seemingly simple case needs thorough investigation to rule out anything serious. Now, about your family… is there any history of colon cancer, stomach cancer, or any other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmph. Now that's a tough one. Didn't spend much time with my father's side of the family. He was… not a pleasant man. My mother, she passed when I was young. My wife’s family… they were okay, but we didn’t talk much about medical things. I think her grandfather had somethin’ with his stomach, maybe ulcers? But honestly, I couldn’t swear to it. It was a long time ago, and we didn't dwell on such things. Mostly just… Yemenis don't really talk about this stuff, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Brad. Cultural factors often play a significant role in how people discuss health concerns. It's alright that you don’t have a detailed family history. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she hated the smell. Said it was a waste of money and bad for your health. And she was usually right. I do drink a bit, though. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two on the weekends. Nothing excessive. And I eat… well, I eat what I can. Not much of an appetite these days, as I said. Mostly just simple things. Rice, lamb, vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass or two of wine with dinner, and a generally simple diet. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothin'. Never been one for pills. I tried some antacids a few times for heartburn, but they didn't do much good. So I just… dealt with it. I believe in letting nature take its course, if you catch my drift. Too many doctors these days, pushin' pills for everything. It's a racket, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Brad. Alright, given your symptoms and medical history, I would like to perform a physical exam. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and then I will need to perform a rectal exam. This will allow me to assess the situation further. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Look, doc, I appreciate you tryin' to help, but… honestly, I’m not keen on that. Seems… intrusive. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn’t you just… give me somethin’ for the bleeding? Maybe some pills? I really don’t like the sound of that exam.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Brad, and I apologize if that makes you feel uneasy. A rectal exam is an important part of evaluating the source of rectal bleeding. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids, fissures, or masses. While it may be uncomfortable, it’s a quick procedure and will provide valuable information. Without it, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your bleeding and provide the appropriate treatment. I would strongly recommend it. However, I want you to feel comfortable, and we can discuss alternatives, though they may not be as accurate. We could start with a stool test to check for blood, but that won't give us as much information as a physical exam. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I'm a simple man, alright? I deal with… the finished product all day. I don’t like people pokin' around down there. But… I suppose if it’s necessary… I just don’t like it. Fine. Do your exam. But be quick about it, alright? And… try not to make a mess. Honestly, this whole thing is… undignified.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Brad. I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will also ensure your dignity is maintained throughout the procedure. I will explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. I’ll need to lubricate the area and then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may feel like you have the urge to have a bowel movement. This is normal. I will be checking for any abnormalities and assessing the source of the bleeding. I’ll let you know if I feel anything of concern. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with, doc. Quickly, please. And… tell me when it's done. Honestly, this is awful. I really hate doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I’m just going to lubricate the area now. This may feel cool. Okay, here we go… I’m gently inserting my finger now. Take a deep breath… It may feel like you need to push, but try to relax. I’m feeling some tenderness internally. There are no obvious masses, but I do feel some hemorrhoids, which appear to be inflamed. I’m not detecting any blood at this time. However, the tenderness suggests there might be some inflammation further up. Okay, Brad, that’s all done. I apologize again for any discomfort. I’m going to need to collect a stool sample to test for blood. I’ll also order a complete blood count to check for anemia and some inflammation markers. Would you be able to provide a stool sample before you leave today?
PATIENT: Inflamed hemorrhoids? That’s it? All this for… piles? Honestly, doc, you’re telling me I went through all of that for hemorrhoids? I could have gotten somethin' for that at the drugstore. A stool sample… fine. Give me the container. But if it turns out to be somethin' serious, I’m holdin' you personally responsible for all the indignity.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Brad. While hemorrhoids are a common cause of rectal bleeding, it’s important to rule out other, more serious possibilities, which is why I wanted to perform the exam and order the tests. The bleeding could also be caused by a combination of factors. The CBC will help us determine if you’ve lost a significant amount of blood and whether you're anemic. The stool test will detect if there is blood present and also check for any signs of infection. We’ll need to wait for the results before we can determine the best course of treatment. I expect the results within a few days. Here are the instructions for collecting the stool sample. Please bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and eating a diet high in fiber to help soften your stools. We can discuss over-the-counter treatments for the hemorrhoids, such as creams or suppositories, if you'd like. Would you like me to write you a prescription for something, or would you prefer to try an over-the-counter option first?
PATIENT: Fiber… fluids… creams… Honestly, it's all a lot of fuss for somethin’ that probably isn't even serious. Look, doc, I'll try the fiber and drink some water. And I guess I'll bring you the… sample. But if this doesn't clear up quick, I'm findin' another doctor. One who doesn't poke around in places he shouldn't. And please, don’t bother callin’ me with good news. Just call if it's somethin' bad. I've got better things to do than spend my day worryin' about piles.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. I will respect your wishes. I will contact you only if the test results indicate something concerning. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, heavy bleeding, dizziness, or weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. Here’s my card with the clinic’s contact information. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I hope you feel better soon. Thank you for coming in today, Brad. It takes courage to seek medical attention, and I appreciate you trusting me with your care.
