DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. So, you're here today… for what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Um… swelling, the nurse mentioned. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I just noticed it a few days ago, I believe. Somewhere on my… face, was it?
DOCTOR: Right. Swelling. “A few days ago.” Vague, unfortunately. On your face, you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. It’s frustrating, I apologize. Let me think… it’s mostly on this side, and… perhaps a little under my eye? It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit… warm, maybe? It doesn’t feel like a bruise, if that helps. I really wish I could recall what might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Warm, non-painful swelling on the left cheek and potentially under the eye. And no known trauma?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I haven’t… bumped into anything, or had any injuries. I spend most of my time indoors, working with patients, so it’s unlikely to be from that. Though… I did try a new face cream last week. Could it be that?
DOCTOR: A new face cream. Possibly. It could be a contact dermatitis, but we need to rule out other things. Let's do a quick exam. Please sit up straight and look forward. I'm going to palpate the area. Just tell me if anything is particularly tender.
PATIENT: Certainly. That sounds sensible. Palpate… yes, I understand. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is mild erythema – redness – and warmth to the left cheek, as you mentioned. There’s some pitting edema – fluid retention – and it is somewhat tender to the touch, though not severely. No visible lesions or signs of infection. Lymph nodes in the neck feel… normal. I’m not seeing anything alarming, but the warmth and tenderness are concerning. Have you had a fever or any chills recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever or chills. I’ve felt… a little tired, perhaps, but I often do. It’s hard to say if that’s related. And my appetite has been normal, if that’s helpful. Honestly, it just appeared. It’s rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, normal appetite. Look, Mr. Tomassoni, while it could be a reaction to the face cream, the tenderness suggests something more. I’m going to order a CBC – complete blood count – just to rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory process. And I’d like a basic metabolic panel as well. It’s standard procedure. Would you be able to provide me with a list of any medications you are currently taking, and any known allergies?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Medications… let me think. I don’t take anything regularly, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for headaches, if needed. As for allergies… I believe I’m allergic to penicillin, yes. A mild rash, nothing serious. And I think… dust, a little. It makes me sneeze. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. And a dust allergy, fine. Look, Mr. Tomassoni, I understand your memory isn't perfect, but we need to be thorough. I'm sending you to the lab for those blood tests now. While we wait for the results, I recommend discontinuing use of the new face cream immediately. If the swelling worsens, or you develop a fever, chills, or any pus-like discharge, go to the emergency room, understood?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I understand completely. Discontinue the face cream, and emergency room if anything worsens. I’ll remember that. And thank you for your patience, Dr. Dechene. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your help. Where to the lab, please?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take it from there. The results should be back within a few hours, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Next patient.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Dechene. I will. .
