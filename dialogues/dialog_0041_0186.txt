DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Uh, just need a check-up for… a team tryout. Sports team, you know? Gotta make sure I’m not too old to break anything.
DOCTOR: A team tryout, alright. That’s good planning, getting checked out beforehand. And 62 is… certainly not too old to be active, though we'll want to make sure everything’s in working order. Just to get a better picture, what sport are you trying out for?
PATIENT: Mongolian wrestling. Don’t worry, it’s not like… American football. Less running, more… grappling. Mostly grappling. It's a bit different.
DOCTOR: Grappling, okay, good to know. That changes things a bit. Less impact, generally, but still requires a good deal of strength and flexibility. Let's start with a quick history. Have you been actively wrestling recently, or is this a return to it after a break?
PATIENT: Um… it’s been a little while. Maybe… five years? I still keep up with it, training a bit with some friends, mostly just technique stuff. Not full-on matches, you know? Just enough to keep the skills sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, so five years, keeping up with technique… that’s helpful. No recent full matches, good. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort while training, even minor things?
PATIENT: No, nothing really. A little soreness sometimes, the usual old man stuff. But no sharp pains or anything like that. My knees are okay, I think. They creak a bit in the morning, but what knees don’t at my age?
DOCTOR: Creaking knees… a common complaint, you're right. Alright, that’s good to hear. Just to be thorough, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I’m pretty healthy, actually. I eat okay, don’t smoke, hardly ever drink. Never been diagnosed with anything, to be honest. Though… my brother had some heart trouble a few years back. But that was him, not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Hospitalized… hmm. When I was a kid, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was… a long time ago. Nothing since then. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. Tried some weird stuff in my travels, never had a reaction. Not that I recommend trying everything, mind you.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every now and then. Old man stuff, you know? Gotta keep the bones strong. That’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. So, just to recap – no major medical issues, no surgeries, no allergies, just a multivitamin now and then. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything specific you’re worried about?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Just want to make sure I don’t pull a muscle, you know? Don't want to embarrass myself in front of the younger guys. And… maybe make sure my heart’s okay. Just in case. My brother, you know? But I feel fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we'll definitely listen to your heart and lungs. It's always good to check, especially with a family history. And we'll do a quick musculoskeletal exam to check for any muscle weakness or joint issues. Okay, if you don’t mind, let's start with your heart and lungs. If you could just sit back and relax while I listen with the stethoscope?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead. I’ll try to relax. Just… get it over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Again… and exhale. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from a bit of nervousness, or just talking. Rhythm is regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Hurry up, please. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but again, could be situational. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's just do a quick neurological check. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions and then check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Just… get it over with. I’m not good with tests. Never was.
DOCTOR: Alright, nothing to worry about. Just a few simple things. First, can you tell me your name and today’s date?
PATIENT: Lamark Kingan. And… it’s August 2nd, 2025. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Uh… a doctor’s office. Rural area, I think. Not my usual kind of place.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head, just your eyes.
PATIENT: There. Is that good? Can we finish this now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising.
PATIENT: Ow! See? I told you I’m not good with tests! Can we just skip this part? I’m a wrestler, not a… a test subject.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be upset. It's just a reflex check. A weak response can be normal, but we should investigate further. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s… walking. It’s not Olympic-level, but it’s walking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. Based on this quick exam, your heart and lungs sound okay, but your blood pressure is a little elevated. Your reflexes are a bit weak, and your gait is slightly uneven. Given your family history of heart trouble and these findings, I think it's important to get a more thorough evaluation. I recommend an EKG and some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: EKG… blood work…? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I just need a check-up for wrestling, not… a full medical workup. Can’t you just… sign off on it? Tell me I’m okay? I promise I’ll be careful.
DOCTOR: Lamark, I understand your concerns about cost and time, and I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't think they were important. It's not about whether you will be careful; it's about making sure you can be. Wrestling is physically demanding, and we need to rule out any potential problems that could put your health at risk. Ignoring these findings could have serious consequences. Unfortunately, I can't ethically sign off on your check-up without a more thorough evaluation. I'm obligated to ensure your safety, and that requires further investigation. I understand you're uninsured, and that can make things difficult. We do have some resources available to help with the cost of testing, and I can connect you with a financial counselor to explore your options. Would you be open to discussing that?
PATIENT: Financial counselor… great. More paperwork. Fine. Okay. Do what you have to do. But… can we hurry it up? I really need to get this over with. I have a practice to get to, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. I appreciate your cooperation. I'll get the orders for the EKG and blood work ready. We can do the EKG here in the office, and you can get the blood work done at the lab down the street. It should take about an hour or two, total. In the meantime, I’m going to write up a summary of our conversation and the exam findings. Also, I’ll give you a list of some warning signs to watch out for – things like chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – and tell you to go to the emergency room immediately if you experience any of those. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Chest pain… dizziness… yeah, sure. Just… get it over with. The sooner I can get this done, the better. And… how much is all this going to cost me? Just give me a ballpark figure. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, the EKG should be around $150, and the blood work panel will be approximately $300. That’s before any potential discounts or assistance programs. The financial counselor can help you explore options to reduce those costs. I understand this is a lot, and I wish there was a cheaper way. But I believe it's essential to get a clear picture of your health before you start wrestling. While I finish up the paperwork, do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No. Just… paperwork. Let’s just get it over with. I guess I’ll need to call my brother. He usually handles this stuff. This is just… great.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. As soon as you get these tests done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results. We can then make an informed decision about whether it's safe for you to participate in wrestling. I understand this is frustrating, but your health is the most important thing. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any immediate questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… the lab down the street, you said? And… the financial counselor? I guess I’ll figure it out. Thank you… I think. Wrestling… what was I thinking?
