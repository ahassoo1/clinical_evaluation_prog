DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… my wife, she want… baby. We old, you know? I think… she want to make sure everything okay before… before try. I forget things easy now, so maybe she explain better. But, yes. Baby.
DOCTOR: A baby, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A baby. It… important to her. We been married long time. No baby yet… maybe now good time? I don’t know… she say talk to doctor. That why I here. Is that… right? I sometimes get confused.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. That is… certainly a request. Your wife wishes to become pregnant. And you are here, understandably, to ensure… viability. Let’s start with you, Mr. Carlotta. You are 70 years of age, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Seventy. I think so. It… feels long time. My wife, she keeps track of things better. I… I work with my hands, you know? Metal and plastic. Making small things. Maybe that… make my head a little foggy sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It is not uncommon for individuals to experience some cognitive decline with age. However, we must rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any memory loss aside from simply forgetting things, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Memory loss… aside? Hmm. Let me think… Sometimes I… I don’t know where I put things. Keys, mostly. And… names. Faces too. But it’s just… old age, I think. Not… scary things. My wife gets worried when I forget, but… it’s always something small. Nothing… big. Is that… is that what you mean? Like… not knowing who she is? No. Never that.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. But we must be thorough. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions—high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor told me something about that a long time ago. Maybe. He give me pills. I take them… sometimes. I forget, you know? And… no diabetes. I don’t think so. And my heart… feels okay. Beats, you know? Like a drum. I work hard with my hands, that’s all. Is that… bad for heart? My wife, she worry about that too. She say I need to rest more.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’ve mentioned high blood pressure, for which you take medication intermittently. And no known diabetes. Let's move on to medications. Besides the blood pressure pills, are you currently taking anything else—vitamins, supplements, herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Vitamins… hmm. Sometimes I take… the orange ones. Vitamin C, I think? For… colds. But not always. And… no, that’s all. My wife, she gets me things sometimes. But I don’t remember what they are for. Little pills. She say good for… old people. I forget the names. And… no, I don't take anything else. Not that I remember. I wish I could help more. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Carlotta, this is important. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes. A long time ago. When I was young man. Something with my… knee. Football. I play football when I young. Hurt my knee. They fix it. That’s all I remember. Just the knee. And… I think that’s all. A long time ago. I don’t like hospitals. Scary places. Is that… enough? Is it important what kind of surgery it was?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Carlotta. But we will proceed. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, stroke, dementia?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's hard. I… I don’t know my family very well. My wife, she knows more. I come from… far away. Somalia, you know? I no see family much. I think… maybe heart problems? My father, he… he sick. But I don’t remember what kind of sick. He old. Very old. And… no, I don't think so. No cancer. No… stroke. Just… old age. Is that enough? My wife, she would know better. She keeps everything in her head. I forget so much. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed, Mr. Carlotta. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoke. My wife, she no like smoke. Bad for health, you know? Always tell me. I drink… sometimes. A little beer. With dinner. Not every day. Just… when I happy. Or… sad. Not much. Just… a little. Is that… bad? I don’t think so. But my wife, she worry. She say everything bad for health. She very careful. I just… I like small things. Making things. And… a little beer sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Carlotta, before we proceed further, I must inform you that attempting to conceive at your age presents… significant risks. Are you aware of those risks?
PATIENT: Risks? Hmm. You mean… for baby? Or for wife? Or for me? I no think about risks. I just… wife want baby. She sad. I want her happy. She say it okay. She strong woman. Maybe… maybe she know more than me. I just… old. I no think about risks. I just want help her. Is… is it very dangerous? Tell me… so I can understand. But I trust my wife. She always right.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, while your wife’s wishes are understandable, it is my professional obligation to inform you of the substantial complications involved. At your age, the risk of genetic abnormalities in a child is extremely high. Furthermore, the pregnancy itself poses significant risks to your wife’s health. We would require extensive genetic testing and a thorough evaluation of your wife’s health to even consider this. I strongly advise against proceeding without a full understanding of these risks. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Genetic… abnormalities? For baby? You mean… something wrong with baby? Oh. Oh dear. No… I no want that. My wife… she no want that either. I… I did not think about that. She just… sad. She want a baby before… before it too late. I… I understand now. Maybe… maybe it not good idea. I think… I need to talk to my wife. She need to know the risks. I… I don’t want to hurt her. Or the baby. You mean… it very dangerous? More dangerous than I think? I… I feel… confused now. Maybe you talk to my wife? She listen to you. I… I forget things, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Carlotta. I will speak with your wife directly. However, I must reiterate that at your ages, the likelihood of a successful, healthy pregnancy is extremely low. I suggest she consider alternative options. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for both of you to discuss these options in detail. For now, let me examine your wife. I will need a complete medical history from her as well. Please, have a seat. I'll be with you both shortly.
