DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Benic, is it?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s me. Aurthur Benic. Though most folks just call me Aurthur. Good to meet ye, Doctor... Dechêne, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And you can call me Carrington, if you must. Though frankly, I have a rather full schedule today. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Och, aye, no bother at all, Carrington. I understand completely. Well, it’s this nausea, see? Been gettin’ it most mornings for… must be a couple o’ weeks now. It’s not terrible, not like chuckin’ up, but enough to put me off my breakfast, and that’s sayin’ somethin’. The nurse asked about my heart, and… well, I’ve had a bit o’ bother with that in the past. That’s what she said I should mention.
DOCTOR: “A bit of bother.” Right. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well… about five years ago, I was diagnosed with heart failure. It’s not… it’s not gettin’ worse, not that I've noticed, but I take some tablets for it, aye? Furosemide, and Lisinopril, I think they are. And now this nausea. It just… comes on when I wake up, usually. Then it fades after a bit. It’s just… unusual. I don't normally get sick to my stomach.
DOCTOR: Furosemide and Lisinopril… yes, I see. And the nausea is specifically in the morning?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Almost always in the mornin’. Within an hour o’ wakin’ up. Sometimes it’s just a queasy feelin’, other times I actually feel like I might… well, ye ken. But it never actually happens, thankfully. It's more the threat o' it, I suppose. I usually try to have a wee biscuit or somethin’ with a cup o’ tea, and that helps settle it, but… it’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Och, aye, let me think. Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I’m 63, and a bit o’ damp weather always knocks me for six, so I didn’t think much o’ it. No swelling in me ankles or anything like that. Appetite’s been a bit off, which is probably the nausea’s fault. And… I’ve been feelin’ a wee bit breathless, but again, that's happened before when the weather changes. It's hard to say what's normal for me, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Right. And you said this has been going on for a couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Aye, a good fortnight, I'd say. Maybe a bit longer. It started gradually, just a wee bit o' queasiness, and it’s slowly gotten a bit more… noticeable. It’s not crippling, mind ye. I'm still gettin’ about, still doin’ me bit o’ gardenin’, but… it's a worry, see? Especially with the heart condition. I don't want somethin' bein' missed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick examination. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to feel your abdomen. It won't be extensive, but it's necessary. If you could just lie down for me.
PATIENT: Aye, no problem at all. Happy to do whatever ye need. Just let me know if ye need me to adjust or anything. Old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be!
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, though a bit of a murmur still present, as expected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Nothing immediately alarming on the physical exam.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, at least. I was worryin’ it might be somethin’ serious. Is there anything ye think it could be, then? Or should we run some tests, just to be sure?
DOCTOR: Well, nausea can be a side effect of both furosemide and lisinopril, although it's not a common one. It could also be something completely unrelated. Given your history, we should rule out a few things. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function and electrolytes – and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. It's just to get a baseline and ensure everything is functioning properly. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough. I appreciate ye bein' thorough. I'd rather be safe than sorry, ye ken? Will I need to fast for any o’ these tests? And where will I be givin’ the sample? I haven’t had blood taken in… well, a good while, now.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. Nothing to eat or drink, except water. The nurse will give you specific instructions. The lab is just down the hall, first door on the right. They’ll take care of everything. And honestly, Mr. Benic, if it persists despite these tests being normal, I may recommend a consult with a gastroenterologist. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood this afternoon.
PATIENT: Right then. Fastin’ for 12 hours, and the lab’s down the hall. I can manage that. A gastroenterologist, ye say? That sounds… a bit more serious. But if ye think it’s best, I trust yer judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s precautionary, Mr. Benic. Don't jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions and draw the blood. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Och, no, I think that's all, thank ye kindly. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen, and for not dismissin' my worries. It's a relief to know we're gettin' it checked out. I'll see the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Mr. Benic.
PATIENT: Aye, ye too, Doctor. .
