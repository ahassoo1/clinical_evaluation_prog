DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Memmolo, it's… it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’m havin’ trouble… emptying my bladder completely. It feels like there's always somethin’ left in there, even after I go. It’s been goin’ on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. About a month. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's… uncomfortable. And I find myself goin’ to the bathroom a lot more often, just to try and get everything out. It's mostly at night, though. Wakes me up sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… how would you describe your stream?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a… personal question, Doctor. But I'll try to explain. It’s not… strong, like it used to be. It starts okay, but then it kinda… tapers off. Like it’s weak, and I have to push a little to finish. Sometimes it just… stops and starts again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And you said more frequent at night?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Usually I sleep right through, but now I'm gettin’ up… two, maybe three times a night to use the bathroom. It's wearin' me out a bit, bein' honest. It’s not like me to be bothered with things like that. My wife… she used to say I could sleep through a blizzard.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any pain with urination, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, no pain. And no blood that I've noticed. Just… the feelin’ of not emptyin’ completely and havin’ to go so often. It's not a sharp pain, just a general discomfort, you know? Like somethin's not right. It’s not worryin’ me bad, but it’s botherin’ me enough to come see you.
DOCTOR: Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I know of, ma'am. Nobody in my family ever had it, as far as I know. I haven't ever been told I had it, if that's what you mean. I mostly eat fish and berries, things my people have always eaten. I try to stay healthy, livin’ out here like we do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Let me think… Now, I did have a bit of a cold last month, maybe around the time this started. Just a regular cold, sniffles and a cough. Didn’t last too long, couple of days. Took some over-the-counter medicine and it went away. Not much else, honestly. I usually stay pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And medications?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gives me when I need it, ma’am. I take somethin' for my blood pressure, a small pill every mornin’. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take somethin' for that, too. But that’s it. Mostly just try to tough it out, like my grandma always said.
DOCTOR: And what are the names of those medications, Mr. Hilber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one, Doctor. I… I don't remember the names, to be honest. My mind ain’t what it used to be. They’re both white pills, one’s smaller than the other. I get ‘em from the pharmacy down at the village, they know what I need. I just tell ‘em my doctor’s name and they fill the prescription. I’m sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: It's... important to know what you're taking, Mr. Hilber. Alright, let’s move on. Any allergies?
PATIENT: You're right, ma'am, you're absolutely right. I should pay more attention. It’s just… so many things these days. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. We eat a lot of wild berries, and sometimes different plants, and never had any trouble. Maybe a few mosquito bites, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s do a quick exam, then. I want to check your prostate. It's a standard procedure, Mr. Hilber, and will help us determine what might be going on. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need you to turn onto your side.
PATIENT: Oh. That… that sounds a little personal, Doctor. I’ve never had that done before. Is it… necessary? I don’t want to be rude, but… it sounds uncomfortable. Is there somethin’ else we can try first?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, it is necessary to properly assess your condition. Given your symptoms, this is a routine step in ruling out common causes. I assure you, I am a professional, and I will make you as comfortable as possible. It will be quick. Do you have any other medical concerns I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, alright, Doctor. If you say it's necessary… I just don’t like folks messin’ around down there, if you know what I mean. It’s a… private part. But if it’ll help, I suppose I can do it. No, nothin' else botherin’ me. Just this trouble with my bladder. And my arthritis, but that’s always there, comin’ and goin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie on your side, facing away from me, we’ll get this over with. Please relax as much as possible. And, if you feel any discomfort, let me know immediately. Okay. That’s all. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, which could be contributing to your symptoms. I’d like to order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test. It will help us determine if there’s an infection or any other issues we need to address. We will also need to check your blood sugar.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. Sounds like a lot of tests, but if it’ll get to the bottom of things, I’m willin’. Will I need to come back another day for all those? And… what does all that mean? Enlarged prostate… that doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: You'll need to come back tomorrow morning for a blood draw, and the lab will take a urine sample when you're here. An enlarged prostate is common as men age, Mr. Hilber. It doesn’t automatically mean anything serious. It can cause urinary problems, but we need the test results to determine the best course of action. I'll have the lab results sent to my office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I… I think that’s all for now. Just a bit worried, to be honest. But if you think these tests will help, I trust your judgement. Thank you for seein’ me, Doctor. And… thank you for explainin’ things, even if I didn’t understand everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab will give you instructions on how to prepare for the tests. Please follow them carefully. You can schedule the follow-up appointment with the receptionist on your way out. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. I will. Have a good day to you too.
