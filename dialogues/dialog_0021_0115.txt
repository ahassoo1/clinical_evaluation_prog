DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, honestly, all the dates seem to…blur together these days. Is there something specific you needed to know? I do hope this won’t take too long, dear.
DOCTOR: Well, I’m Dr. Havird. And I just need to know why you’re here today. What’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the doctor. My apologies. It’s…well, it’s my skin. It’s turned quite yellow, you see. A friend mentioned something about…the liver? I believe that’s what she said. And some illness…hepatitis, perhaps? I don’t recall precisely. It’s been a bit worrying, naturally. Though I’m not quite sure what they did to fix it before, if anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yellow skin…jaundice, that’s what we call it. And you’re concerned about your liver. Right. Has this yellowing been gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Jaundice…yes, that sounds right. It’s been…gradual, I think. Not a sudden shock, more like…a slow fading in. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, honestly. Everything feels a little…muddled these days. I do try to keep track, but…it escapes me. Is it…serious?
DOCTOR: Well, yellowing of the skin can be serious, yes. It indicates something is going on with your liver or gallbladder, or sometimes even red blood cells. We'll need to investigate. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. Let me think…other symptoms… …I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual. And my stomach…it's been a bit…unsettled, I suppose. Not painful, just…not right. And a bit of an appetite loss, I think. But truthfully, I haven’t been eating much of anything these days, so that’s hard to say. Is that helpful? I’m terribly sorry if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, unsettled stomach, loss of appetite…okay. That's…something. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes in…my stool? Well, now you’re asking me something rather personal, aren’t you? I suppose…yes, a bit paler than usual, I’ve noticed. Though, to be honest, I don’t pay much attention to such things. It’s…not something one discusses, you know? Is that important? Perhaps we could talk about something else?
DOCTOR: It is important, Annelle. Changes in stool color can indicate problems with your liver and digestive system. Pale stools can be a sign of a blockage in the bile duct. It's vital information. Have you also noticed any itching?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A blockage…that sounds dreadful. Bile duct…yes, well, I’ve been a bit itchy lately, now that you mention it. Not constantly, but…periods of it. Mostly on my arms and back. I assumed it was just the dry weather. We’ve had such a warm summer, you know. Is that…connected to everything else? I truly hope this isn’t anything too serious. I don’t have insurance, you see, and medical bills…well, they’re quite daunting.
DOCTOR: Okay. Itching, pale stools, yellow skin, tiredness, loss of appetite… We need to do a physical exam. And I'm going to order some blood tests. Those will tell us a lot more about what's going on with your liver. Can I ask about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests…very well. I suppose that’s necessary. Medical history…hmm. Let me see. I…I was quite healthy for most of my life, truly. No major illnesses, as far as I recall. I did have my gallbladder removed many years ago, though. Perhaps twenty…thirty years? I’ve always been a bit forgetful, you see, so the exact date escapes me. Other than that…nothing significant comes to mind. I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a very long time. Is that…helpful? Should I be remembering something else?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removed. That's…relevant. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Not at all. I don’t take any medications. Never have, really. I always preferred natural remedies, you see. A bit of chamomile tea for sleep, that sort of thing. I’m a very simple woman, with very simple needs. Though, admittedly, my memory is…not what it used to be. Perhaps I did take something at one point, but I honestly couldn’t say. Is it important? I do apologize if I'm not being very helpful. I truly am trying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies…no, dear. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No reactions to anything, as far as I can recall. Though…I do get a bit of a rash if I’m around certain flowers, perhaps? But I wouldn’t consider that a true allergy. It’s just a minor irritation, really. Is that relevant? I’m starting to feel a little…faint, actually. All these questions…it's a bit overwhelming. Perhaps we could wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just need to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a look at your skin. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Oh…very well. A physical exam. I do hope it won’t be too unpleasant. I’m not a fan of doctors, you see. Though I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it's best. Please be gentle, dear. And perhaps…we could keep the conversation to a minimum? It makes me rather nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back, please. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Deep breaths, if you can. Heart sounds are…regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear, but with reduced breath sounds. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if anything feels painful. Hmm. Slight tenderness here…liver area. And your skin is markedly jaundiced. I’m noting the sclera are also yellowed.
PATIENT: Oh…that feels…a bit uncomfortable. Yes, that’s rather tender, as you said. I do feel a bit of discomfort there. My skin…is it that bad? I hadn’t really noticed. Oh dear. It is quite noticeable, isn’t it? Is…is it serious, doctor? Please be honest with me. I’m starting to feel rather frightened. And could we please wrap this up soon? It's all a bit overwhelming, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam and your symptoms, we need to run some blood tests to evaluate your liver function, check for infection, and rule out any blockage in the bile duct. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a liver function test, and a bilirubin level. I’ll also order an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. I'm also going to order a hepatitis panel, just to be thorough. We’ll need to get these tests done as soon as possible. I’ll have the lab draw the blood right away. Then, you’ll need to schedule an appointment for the ultrasound. The lab results will take a few days, and we can discuss them when I get them. Here’s the order for your blood tests. The lab is just down the hall. And I'll have the receptionist schedule your ultrasound before you leave. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh…so many tests. A hepatitis panel…that sounds rather frightening. And an ultrasound…will it be unpleasant? I…I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. I’m rather overwhelmed, as you can imagine. Just…please be thorough, doctor. I want to know what’s wrong, and I want it fixed. And…could you please tell me how much all of this will cost? I’m very worried about the bill. Honestly, I'd rather just know the worst, if that's what it is. It’s best to be prepared, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage—but since you're uninsured, it will be the full charge. I don’t have the exact price breakdown available at the moment, but I can have the billing department contact you with an estimate. It will likely be several hundred dollars, but we can discuss payment options if needed. As for the ultrasound, it’s non-invasive—it just uses sound waves to create an image. It shouldn't be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable if the technician needs to press firmly on your abdomen. I'll have the lab and radiology departments contact you to schedule the appointments. And I'll be in touch once I receive the results. For now, just try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. And try not to worry too much—we’ll figure this out. .
