DOCTOR: Hi Bradlee, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Ranjan, nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery, I think? It’s… for my weight. I’ve been talking to someone about it, and they said I needed to come here for an evaluation first. Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I don't remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're exploring weight loss surgery as an option, and you've been referred here for an evaluation. That's a great first step. Don't worry about the details being fuzzy – we can go over everything together. First, let's talk a little bit about your weight and your overall health. Can you tell me how long you’ve been concerned about your weight?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time, I guess. Most of my adult life, really. It's… always been a bit of a struggle. I don’t really know when it started being a big concern, exactly. Maybe… after I got married? I’m married, yeah. To Layla. But it's been years, definitely. It's just… always there, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a long-term issue. It’s completely normal for it to be difficult to pinpoint exactly when it became a major concern. Okay, so “years” – roughly how many years would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… let me think. Layla and I have been married… fifteen years now? So, probably… at least ten, maybe twelve years? It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t really keep track of things like that. It just… gradually got worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, about ten to twelve years. And it gradually got worse over time. Can you tell me a little bit about what you’ve tried to manage your weight in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh… lots of things. Diets, mostly. You know, the usual. Atkins, Weight Watchers… I tried a few of those fancy meal delivery things for a bit. And I tried to exercise… I joined a gym once, but didn’t really go. It never really stuck, to be honest. Nothing really worked for very long. And then… it just kind of… stopped working at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried various diets and exercise programs in the past, but haven’t had long-term success. That's very common. And it sounds like it's become increasingly difficult. Before we talk more about surgery, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I don’t think so. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, honestly. Layla keeps telling me I should go, but… I just haven’t. I don’t feel sick, you know? I get tired easily, but… I just figured that was because of work. I work at a store, retail. It’s a lot of being on my feet. I don't know about any of those things – diabetes, high blood pressure… I haven’t been checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, you haven’t been to the doctor recently and aren’t aware of any medical conditions. That’s alright, we can check everything today. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Nothing major, anyway. I think I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. No, I don't think I've ever been in the hospital as an adult. Layla hasn't mentioned anything, and she remembers everything. So, probably not. I don’t really… do well with hospitals. They scare me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations as an adult. That’s good to know. And it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about hospitals. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, heart disease, or obesity?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we’re not really big on talking about health stuff. My dad… he had some heart problems, I think? But I don’t know what kind. And my mom… she was… bigger, I guess? But I don’t know if that was genetic or… I honestly don’t know a lot about my family’s health history. It wasn’t something we talked about much. It’s… a bit of a blur. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common for family health history to be unclear or not well-documented. We can work with what you know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never smoked. I don’t really drink, maybe a sip of Layla’s wine sometimes at special occasions. And definitely no drugs. I stay away from all of that. It’s… not for me. I work enough hours as it is! I need to be clear-headed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Layla gives me a little Benadryl sometimes if I get a bad cold, and I’ve never had a reaction. Nothing comes to mind. I don’t really take much medication, thankfully. Just… over-the-counter stuff when I need it. I’m pretty lucky that I don’t have allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright Bradlee, thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam to get a baseline of your health. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and listen to your abdomen. Then we'll order some labs to get a better idea of what’s going on internally. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… it won't be too uncomfortable, right? I'm not a big fan of doctors, if you can't tell.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It won't be anything too invasive, just a routine check-up. Okay, let’s start with your height and weight. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go...
DOCTOR: Okay, your height is 5'8" and your weight is 245 pounds. Thank you. I'm listening to your heart now... sounds regular, but slightly fast. Blood pressure is 150/90. That's a little elevated. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, but there's some fullness. Okay, Bradlee, that was quick. Everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is elevated, and there’s some fullness in your abdomen. We'll need to run some labs to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay… elevated blood pressure. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Fullness… is that because of… you know? I figured something was going on. What kind of labs do I need? And will they be… painful? I’m really not good with needles.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, but it's not necessarily a cause for immediate panic. Elevated blood pressure can be managed, and we'll figure out what's causing it. The fullness could be related to your weight, but we need to rule out other things with some tests. As for the labs, we'll need a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and liver function. We'll also need a thyroid test. We might do a metabolic panel as well. As for the needles, it will be a standard blood draw. It’s a quick pinch, but it shouldn't be too painful. We can use a numbing cream if you’re really worried about it. The phlebotomist is very good. Would you like me to order the numbing cream?
PATIENT: Yeah… please. The numbing cream sounds… really good. I really don’t like needles. And what’s a phlebotomist? Is that the person who does the… drawing? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to wait forever.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get the order for the numbing cream right away. A phlebotomist is a professional who specializes in drawing blood. They’re very skilled at it, and they’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for the lab results to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Okay, I'm ordering the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll let you know when they're ready for you. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything… for now. Just… 3-5 business days. Okay. I hope it doesn’t show anything too bad. Thank you, Dr. Ranjan. I guess I’ll go get my blood drawn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. Don’t worry too much – we’re just gathering information. The lab technicians are excellent, and they’ll take good care of you. If you have any questions or concerns while you're waiting, please don’t hesitate to ask the nurses at the front desk. Let me know if you have any trouble finding the lab. We’ll be in touch once the results are back. Take care.
