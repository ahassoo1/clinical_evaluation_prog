DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be perfectly frank. I’ve noticed… a bit of discharge. Down there. It’s just… not normal, is it? And honestly, I haven't the faintest idea what is normal anymore. Things change, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to discuss these things, Ms. Wartick; it’s why I’m here. Many women experience changes and concerns like this throughout their lives. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what you want me to say. It’s… wet. And not… clean wet, if you understand. More… off-color. A yellowish sort of thing. And it’s been…present for, oh, a week or so now, I suppose. I really don’t pay close attention to… such matters. It’s not as if a lady should be scrutinizing these things, is it? But it's definitely not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Off-color” and yellowish for approximately a week. And a change from what you typically experience. Is there any odor associated with it, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A rather… unpleasant one. Not horrendous, mind you, but certainly not pleasant. It’s… fishy, I believe is the word. Although, I haven’t been eating much fish lately, so I don’t know why it would smell like that. It’s quite bothersome, really. A lady shouldn't smell like a fish, now should she?
DOCTOR: No, certainly not. And thank you for being so forthcoming, Ms. Wartick; that’s very helpful. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or discomfort in the vaginal area?
PATIENT: Well, a little bit of itching, yes. Nothing dreadful, you understand. Just… an occasional irritation. More annoying than painful, really. And a slight… warmth, perhaps? It's hard to say. I assumed it was just… my age. Everything aches a bit these days. But no, no real pain. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, yellowish discharge with a fishy odor, some itching, and mild warmth. Has this happened before, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve… always been quite fastidious about my hygiene. I keep everything very clean, you see. This is… new. And quite upsetting, if I’m being honest. I've never had anything like this happen before. Perhaps it's something I caught somewhere? Although, I haven’t been… anywhere risqué, if that’s what you're thinking.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you've maintained good hygiene. And no, I wasn’t implying anything of the sort. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any other symptoms, like pain with urination or during intercourse?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really! I’m not that sort of woman. I haven't had intercourse in… a very long time. And as for pain with urination, no, no. Nothing like that. Everything functions perfectly adequately, thank you very much. I just don’t appreciate the implication. It's rather… indelicate.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, I meant no offense. Those are simply routine questions to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Let’s put that aside. Have you noticed any changes in your menstrual cycle recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Well, let me see... Everything is irregular, of course. At my age, one can't expect a regular cycle anymore. It comes and goes, when it feels like it. It’s been… lighter, I suppose. And shorter. But that’s just… what happens when you get older, doesn’t it? Nothing to concern oneself with. It's certainly not a predictable affair, I can assure you. Honestly, it's a nuisance, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, irregular and lighter periods. Now, regarding your medical history, do you have any chronic conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of the arthritis in my hands for a bit, but I manage it with a good cream. And the doctor once said my cholesterol was a bit high, but I've been eating a sensible diet, so that should be alright now. I am on Medicare, you see, so I have regular check-ups. No, nothing… serious. Nothing that requires constant medication, thankfully. I try to stay active, you know. A bit of gardening, walking… keeps me going. But generally, I am quite healthy for my age, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And you mentioned Medicare, so you do have regular checkups. Are you currently taking any medications or supplements, besides the arthritis cream?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes. I take a calcium supplement, for the bones, you see. And a Vitamin D tablet, because the doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. And… sometimes, I take a little something for my sleep, if I’m particularly restless. Just a herbal remedy, nothing strong. But that's it, really. Nothing at all that should interfere with… whatever it is that’s going on down there. I pride myself on keeping things natural, you see. No unnecessary chemicals for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, calcium, Vitamin D, and a herbal sleep aid. Thank you. Now, Ms. Wartick, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. This will involve a pelvic exam to get a better look at what's going on. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… pelvic exam? Doctor, really. At my age? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, I’ve already told you everything. Couldn’t you just… prescribe something? An ointment, perhaps? I’m not particularly keen on being… examined. It seems rather… intrusive. And frankly, a bit undignified. I'm quite sure it's nothing serious. Just a bit of… womanly trouble. Surely a cream would suffice?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Wartick, and I would never proceed with anything you're not comfortable with. However, to accurately determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we’re providing the best possible care, a pelvic exam is the most effective step. It allows me to visually assess the area and, if necessary, collect a sample to send to the lab for testing. This will help us rule out any serious conditions and ensure we get you the right treatment. We can discuss exactly what will be involved, and I promise to be as gentle and respectful as possible. We can also stop at any point if you feel uncomfortable. If we skip the exam, we're essentially guessing, and I want to be sure we're addressing the underlying cause of your symptoms correctly. Would you be willing to consider it, knowing I will explain each step and respect your boundaries?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I want everything explained to me. Every single detail. And you must be very gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. I haven’t… been through anything like this in a very long time. And frankly, the thought of it is quite… distressing. But if it’s absolutely necessary… then proceed. But slowly, Doctor. Slowly. And please, no unnecessary… probing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will explain every step before I do it, and we will go at your pace. You are in complete control, and we can stop at any time. I'll have you lie on the table, with your knees bent and feet flat. I’ll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visually examine the area. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Then, I'll gently collect a sample of the discharge with a swab. That will be sent to the lab for testing to identify any infection. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A swab? Will it hurt? And… what exactly are you looking for? I don’t want any unpleasant surprises, Doctor. Honestly, I’ve always been very careful. I just… I don't understand why this is happening. And please, tell me if it's going to sting. I have a low tolerance for… discomfort. And don't leave me in the dark, Doctor. Explain everything. Everything. Before you do it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. I will explain everything as we go. We’re looking for any signs of infection, inflammation, or abnormal changes. The swab will collect a sample of the discharge to identify if there are any bacteria, yeast, or other organisms causing the issue. It might feel a little pressure, like a mild cramping sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately, and we’ll stop. Before I insert the speculum, I’ll explain exactly what it looks like and how it works. It’s a plastic instrument that gently widens the vaginal opening so I can see the cervix. It's lubricated to make it more comfortable. Then, I'll gently collect the sample with a swab. It might feel a little ticklish or cool. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ticklish? Cool? Honestly, Doctor, you make it sound like a spa treatment! It's a private area, you know. A very sensitive area. And frankly, the thought of anything being… widened… is quite alarming. Can't you just… guess? Based on what I've told you? I really don't see the need for all this… poking and prodding. Are you sure it's necessary? Perhaps an ointment would clear it up? A strong antifungal cream? I read something about those online... Please, Doctor. Think carefully. Is there any alternative? I'm not comfortable with this at all. Not one bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Wartick, and I absolutely respect your concerns. You are right to advocate for yourself, and I would never want to proceed with something you are not comfortable with. However, an ointment without knowing what we're treating could potentially worsen the condition or mask the underlying problem. It's important to determine the specific cause of the discharge to ensure we use the correct treatment. While I appreciate your suggestion about an antifungal cream, a yeast infection isn't the only possibility. It could be a bacterial infection, a sexually transmitted infection, or even a reaction to something irritating the area. Without a sample to analyze, we're simply guessing. I’m happy to stop the exam at any point. If we stop, we can discuss other options, such as trying a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but that’s not ideal, as it can lead to antibiotic resistance and may not be effective. I can also refer you to a gynecologist for a second opinion. Before we make a decision, is there anything specific about the exam that’s making you particularly anxious?
PATIENT: It’s… the invasion, Doctor. The feeling of being… exposed. I haven't… been examined like this in decades. And frankly, I don’t want to know what’s wrong. Ignorance is bliss, you know? And the thought of something being… taken from me… it’s just… violating. And frankly, it’s humiliating. I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I don’t need all this… poking and prodding to feel healthy. Surely, a cream would suffice. A strong cream. Or… perhaps a referral. Yes, a referral would be best. To a… a female doctor. Someone who understands. Someone who won't… intrude. I just want this over with, Doctor. I want to go home. And I want to forget all about this unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Wartick. Your comfort and peace of mind are my top priority, and I apologize for causing you any distress. You are absolutely right to advocate for what feels best for you. In that case, we will absolutely stop the exam, and I will be happy to provide a referral to a female gynecologist. I can also provide you with a prescription for a broad-spectrum antifungal cream, as you requested, although I want to reiterate that it may not be the most effective solution without a proper diagnosis. I will write down the referral information and the prescription now. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I want to ensure you feel comfortable and supported moving forward. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thank you. That will be all. The referral and the cream… yes, that is perfect. Just… please, no further examinations. I appreciate your understanding. And thank you for… not pushing me. It’s rare to find a doctor who actually listens these days. Just… the referral and the cream, please. And then, I’d like to go home. Very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. Absolutely. Here is the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed – she has excellent reviews and specializes in women’s health. And here is the prescription for the antifungal cream. Please follow the instructions carefully, and if your symptoms don’t improve within a week, please contact Dr. Reed. I’m glad I could help, and I apologize again for any discomfort I caused. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thank you very much. That is all. Goodbye. .
