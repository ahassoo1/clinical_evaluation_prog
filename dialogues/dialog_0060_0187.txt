DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. I’m Dr. Noordin. Please, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Noordin, yes? Hmph. Look, I don’t have all day. My chest… it feels funny. And my heart… it goes boom-boom. Blood pressure too high, they said at the pharmacy. Just fix it, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowic. I understand you’re feeling unwell and want to get to the bottom of this quickly. "Funny"… can you tell me more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Feels like… like a bird flapping around inside. Not really flapping, but… you know. Tightness. And sometimes, it just skips. Like the engine in my old car. Not good. I don’t like it. It happens when I… when I walk too much. Or get… upset. It’s very annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, tightness and a sensation like a skipped beat, especially with walking or when you're feeling stressed. And you said the pharmacy told you your blood pressure was high. Do you know what your blood pressure reading was, if they happened to write it down?
PATIENT: Pharmacy… they just said “high.” Numbers? No, I don’t remember numbers. I don't bother with that stuff. My wife handles all that. She’s probably… worried. But I told her not to. Old men get things. It’s normal. Just tell me what’s wrong with my heart. Is it… broken?
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll find out exactly what’s going on, Mr. Sobkowic. It doesn't necessarily mean it's "broken". Let's start with a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about some tests to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don't think so. Maybe a little itching sometimes with some… creams. My wife buys them. She knows. I just put whatever she tells me to. Don't make me lie down, though. I don't like lying down. Makes my chest feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no lying down for now. We can do most of this sitting up. Have you been taking any medications currently, even those creams your wife gets you?
PATIENT: Just… a little pill for my water. Doctor gave it to me years ago. Small white one. And the creams, when my skin gets… dry. That's it. Don’t need much. I eat okay, mostly. Rice, fish… normal things. No fancy foods. Don't trust all that new stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. A small white pill for water retention and creams as needed. That’s good to know. Now, let’s quickly check your pulse and listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just loosen your shirt a bit, please.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But hurry. Do it quickly, Doctor. And be careful. I bruise easily. Old skin, you know. Not like when you were young.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your pulse is a little irregular, and I’m hearing a slightly rapid rhythm. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. I also noticed a little swelling in your ankles, Mr. Sobkowic. And your blood pressure is… 160 over 95. That is quite high, as the pharmacy mentioned. We need to address that. Have you ever had any problems with your heart before?
PATIENT: Problems? Not that I remember. Old doctor… years ago, he listened to my chest once. Said I was “fine”. Everyone always says “fine”. Just gets worse with age. What’s going to happen now? You going to give me a lot of pills? I don't want a lot of pills. They make me sleepy.
DOCTOR: We’re not jumping to pills just yet, Mr. Sobkowic. First, I'd like to order a few tests. An EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes for the swelling and high blood pressure. We’ll also want to do a chest X-ray, just to be sure everything looks clear in your lungs. Do you have any family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Family… my father… he was always sick. Something with his stomach. Mother… she just got old and… stopped. Didn’t go to doctors much. They didn’t have good doctors back then. No one had good insurance. Just… old people problems. Is this going to be expensive? My wife… she worries about money. A lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife's worry about the cost. We’ll do our best to keep things reasonable and prioritize the most important tests first. Your insurance should cover most of it, but we can also look into options if there are concerns. The EKG and blood test are relatively straightforward, and the chest X-ray is also fairly standard. Let's get the orders for those tests sent to the lab, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does that sound, Mr. Sobkowic?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. I have… appointments. Important ones. And tell them to be gentle with the blood. I bruise. Really easily. Don't want to be a mess before my meeting. Just get it done. And then I can go. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowic. Here are the orders for the lab tests. Please take this to the lab technician just down the hall, and let them know about your bruising concern. They're very careful. Once they've completed the tests, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with my receptionist. We'll review the results and discuss a plan to get you feeling better. .
