DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, let’s get this over with. You’re 83, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Eighty-three years, give or take. Though honestly, the years do rather blur together after a while, don't they? I suppose it is August, isn't it? A rather warm August, I must say.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s August 2nd. Look, I have a lot of patients today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a… delicate matter. Something of an… inconvenience, really. I don’t typically bother doctors with such things, you understand. A man has his dignity. But… there's been a… discharge. A bit embarrassing to discuss, frankly. It's not pleasant. I noticed it a few days ago, and it hasn't improved. Is that sufficient detail? I don’t believe in dwelling on unpleasantries.
DOCTOR: A discharge… right. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm. Now, let me think… I haven’t been particularly warm, if that’s what you mean. No shivering, no chills. I felt a bit… sluggish, perhaps. But I always feel a bit sluggish these days. It could be the weather. Or the wife’s cooking, honestly. It’s… robust. I don't recall a proper fever, no. Just…tiredness. Is that what you were asking? It’s all so very clinical.
DOCTOR: Okay, sluggishness. And this discharge… where exactly is it coming from?
PATIENT: Goodness. Really, must we be so… explicit? It’s… emanating from the, ah, appropriate area, of course. A gentleman doesn’t need a map to understand where that is, does he? It’s… below. And… well, it’s rather obvious, isn't it? I'm not entirely sure what you expect me to say. It’s certainly not coming from my ear. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? A slight discomfort, perhaps. Not a sharp pain, mind you. More of a… burning sensation, occasionally. It's not crippling, certainly. I’ve endured far worse in my lifetime. Fixing tractors isn’t always gentle work, you know. But it's… noticeable. Especially when… well, when things are at rest. Does that make sense? It's an annoyance, more than anything. A persistent, irritating annoyance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this… annoyance been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see... It began, I believe, sometime last week. Perhaps five or six days ago? It’s difficult to be precise. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. She informed me it wasn’t… normal. A rather blunt assessment, as usual. So, approximately a week. It hasn't gotten worse, but it hasn’t gone away either. Just… persists. A steady, unwelcome presence.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Goodness. This is becoming rather… intrusive. Well, no. Not that I’ve noticed. It flows as it always has, I suppose. No burning, no difficulty. The volume seems… standard. I haven’t been rushing to the lavatory any more or less than usual. It’s all perfectly… functional. Though, now that you mention it, perhaps it's a little weaker than it used to be. But that’s just age, isn’t it? A man's plumbing isn't what it once was, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any new medications?
PATIENT: New medications? No, none whatsoever. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but I've been on that for years. My doctor – a perfectly competent man, though rather young, if you ask me – prescribed it. And that's it. I'm not one for popping pills, you understand. A strong cup of tea is usually sufficient for what ails me. No, no new medications. Absolutely none. I pride myself on maintaining a simple regimen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me take a quick look. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Well, I am as relaxed as can be expected under the circumstances. It's not every day a man has his… anatomy inspected, you know. Though, I must say, the examination room isn't exactly conducive to tranquility. Do try to be gentle, Doctor. And please, do keep it brief. I have errands to run, you understand. A man's time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears normal. No obvious lesions. Palpation… unremarkable. Prostate feels… slightly enlarged. Could be age. It's likely just a mild prostate issue. We can try an antibiotic, just in case of infection. I'll write you a prescription.
PATIENT: An antibiotic, you say? Well, that sounds… sensible. I'm not particularly fond of taking medication, but if it’s to be done, I suppose it’s best to get it over with. A simple prescription, then? Excellent. And you're certain it's nothing… serious? Just a bit of the prostate acting up? Age, you say? I suppose that’s to be expected. A man can't fight Father Time, can he? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency. Now, where would I collect this prescription?
DOCTOR: The nurse at the front desk. Just tell her my name. And don’t bother me unless it gets significantly worse. I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Very well. I shall inform the nurse. "Significantly worse," you say? I suppose I know what that means. Honestly, the lack of bedside manner these days… But, thank you nonetheless, Doctor. A curt acknowledgement is better than none, I suppose. Efficiency over everything… no time for a proper consultation… Hmmph. .
