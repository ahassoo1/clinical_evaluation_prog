DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, it’s good to meet you. I'm Valerie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Valerie, good to meet you too. Um, it's about my bruising. It’s been getting worse, and I’m on a blood thinner, so… yeah. It's kinda worrying me. I just want to figure out what's going on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that’s getting worse is definitely something we should look into, especially with you being on a blood thinner. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? Small bruises, like I just bumped into something, you know? But now… they’re bigger, and I don’t even remember hitting myself. It's mostly on my arms and legs, but I think I saw one on my back yesterday. Does that make sense? I'm pretty sure it wasn't there before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Bruising that appears without a clear injury, and especially if it’s growing in size, is important information. And noticing it on your back is good to know. To clarify, are these bruises painful?
PATIENT: Not really painful, actually. More… tender, if I poke them. Like a really bad, deep bruise feels, but not super sore to the touch. It's weird. It's not like a sharp pain or anything, just… noticeable. I don’t go out of my way to touch them, obviously, but if I do, it's not agony or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tender rather than painful. That’s helpful. And you said you've been on a blood thinner – which one are you taking, and for how long?
PATIENT: Oh, it's Warfarin. I've been on it for… about six months now. The doctor put me on it after my… well, after a blood clot in my leg. It’s been mostly fine, I've had regular check-ups and my levels have been good. That's why I'm confused about the bruising. It just seems… different lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months on Warfarin after a blood clot – I see. And your INR has been stable during that time?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty stable. Last check-up, it was right in the range they wanted, about 2.3, I think. They do blood tests every month to check it. I always get the results sent to my other doctor. I haven't had any issues with the medication itself, no bleeding or anything, until this bruising started. It's just… concerning. I don't want to mess around with something like that, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Stable INR is good, but new bruising is always something we need to investigate further. Just to get a complete picture, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No fever, no dizziness. I haven't noticed any bleeding from my gums or nose, nothing like that. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe, but I figured that was just because it's been so hot. Oh! And my appetite’s been a little off, but nothing major. I just haven't been as hungry. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a slightly decreased appetite. That’s good information. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a visual assessment of the bruising and check for anything else. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, so go ahead. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, I see bruising on both arms, mostly on the forearms and upper arms. The discoloration varies – some are a darker purple, indicating they’re more recent, while others are fading to a brownish color. There’s also some bruising on your legs, similar distribution. And I see a patch on your lower back, as you mentioned. It is tender to the touch, but no swelling or warmth. I'm also checking your skin for any other signs... No petechiae or purpura that I can see. Everything feels relatively normal otherwise. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, I'd like to order some lab work to help figure out what's going on. We'll check a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . I also want to repeat your INR, just to be sure it hasn’t changed, and a PT/PTT. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think will help, I'm happy to do them. I just want to get this figured out. CBC, CMP, INR, PT/PTT… Got it. Will you explain the results to me when they come back? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will absolutely explain everything to you in detail when the results come back. I'll make sure you understand what everything means. In the meantime, let's just try to avoid any activities that could cause further bruising, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, will do. No bumping into things! I'll be careful. So, how long will it take to get the results back? And do I need to fast for any of those tests?
DOCTOR: Good idea. The labs usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. You will need to fast for the CMP – that means nothing to eat or drink except water for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. The CBC, PT and PTT don't require fasting. I'll give you a lab requisition with specific instructions. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect. Fasting for the CMP, no problem. A follow-up next week is good too. Just let me know where to go to get the blood drawn. I don’t think I’ve been to a lab since they did the tests after my clot, so I don't remember. And thank you, Valerie. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's kinda scary when things change, you know?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. I understand. It is unsettling when things change, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. You can get the blood work done at the lab here in the clinic - just sign in at the front desk and they'll take care of you. The address and phone number are on the requisition as well. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been really helpful. I'll go ahead and schedule the blood draw and then the follow-up appointment. Thank you again, Valerie.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. Take care, and I'll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. .
