DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Well, it’s this…patch of skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. It’s just…off-color. Not what one expects, you understand.
DOCTOR: “Off-color,” alright. And where exactly is this patch of skin?
PATIENT: On my left forearm. It started, oh, I’d say about three weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. It's not painful, thankfully, but it’s…noticeable. Especially with a tan. It just doesn't blend. It’s on the inside of the arm, near the elbow crease. Do you need me to be more specific? Some doctors don’t seem to grasp details without being explicitly told everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. More detail is always helpful. So, inside of the left forearm, near the elbow crease. Is it raised, or is it flat?
PATIENT: Flat. Definitely flat. And it's…well, it’s not a vibrant color. It’s…a sort of dull grayish-brown. Not a pleasant shade at all. It’s not itchy, and there’s no blistering, thankfully. I do spend a lot of time with old documents, you know. Perhaps it’s something from those? Though I’m always quite careful.
DOCTOR: Grayish-brown, flat… and you work with old documents, so potential exposure to…something. Right. I'll need to take a closer look, of course. If you don't mind, could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Perfectly understandable. One must be examined. Though I hope it isn’t anything too dreadful. It really is rather unsightly, you know. There. Do be gentle, please. My skin is rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is rather indistinct. And the skin texture feels…slightly rougher in that area, but not significantly. No obvious signs of inflammation. It's about the size of a quarter, I’d say. No bleeding or crusting. Have you noticed any changes in its size or shape since it first appeared?
PATIENT: No, not at all. It's remained…remarkably consistent, actually. Which is odd, isn’t it? One expects something to change, especially over three weeks. It hasn't gotten bigger or smaller, nor has the color deepened. It just…is. Though, now that you mention it, I believe the area around it feels slightly warmer than the rest of my arm. Just a little. It could simply be my imagination, of course. I do tend to overthink these things.
DOCTOR: You're right. It is slightly warmer to the touch. Not significantly, but noticeable. And the consistency…it feels a little different. Not necessarily rougher, but…firmer. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing else at all. No fatigue, no fever, no swelling anywhere else. Just…this. It doesn’t bother me physically, only aesthetically, really. Though, one does worry, doesn’t one? About what these things could be. My husband keeps telling me it’s nothing, just a harmless discoloration, but he isn’t a doctor, is he? He’s an accountant. Numbers, not ailments. And he doesn’t understand the importance of proper diagnosis. It’s quite frustrating, actually.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s take a closer look. Sometimes the finer details can be quite revealing. It does look a bit unusual. Given its consistency and the slight warmth, I'm not entirely convinced it's a simple discoloration. It could be a number of things, honestly. We could do a skin scraping to rule out a fungal infection, or a biopsy to get a definitive diagnosis. But honestly, given your otherwise good health and the lack of other symptoms, it could be something relatively harmless. I'm leaning towards a mild form of dermatitis, perhaps related to something you're handling at work. But we really shouldn't guess. A biopsy will give us a clear answer.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh dear. That sounds…invasive. And unpleasant. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we not simply…try something else first? Perhaps a cream? Or some sort of ointment? I really do dislike the idea of cutting into my skin. Especially for something that is, admittedly, more of a cosmetic concern than a medical emergency. And my husband will be furious if I have a procedure done without his approval. He’s quite particular about these things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I understand your concerns. And, yes, a biopsy does involve a small incision. However, it’s the only way to get a definitive diagnosis. Without knowing what this is, we can’t recommend the appropriate treatment. Applying a cream or ointment blindly could actually worsen the condition, or mask the symptoms and delay proper treatment if it is something more serious. Look, I'm not saying it is serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities. It's responsible medical practice. And frankly, given your…hesitation, I'm going to recommend a referral to a dermatologist. They specialize in skin conditions and can give you a more informed opinion. They can also discuss the risks and benefits of a biopsy with you in more detail. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A dermatologist… Honestly, it seems rather excessive, doesn’t it? For a small patch of skin. I suppose… if you insist. But I expect a very thorough explanation from this dermatologist. And I want to know exactly what they intend to do before they even think about cutting into my skin. And my husband will, of course, need to be present. He has a very good understanding of…medical paperwork. It’s all rather inconvenient, really. Do you have a list of recommended dermatologists? And are they in-network with Medicare? I don't want any unpleasant surprises with the billing.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I have a list here. These are all dermatologists in the area who accept Medicare. I've highlighted a few who specialize in conditions like yours. As for your concerns, I will make a note in your referral to emphasize the importance of a thorough explanation and obtaining your informed consent before any procedure. I can't control what the dermatologist does, but I can certainly make your preferences known. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that will be all. Though, I do hope this dermatologist is someone… reasonable. And efficient. I do not have all day to spend at appointments. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose we shall see what happens. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Ms. Bartock. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before your appointment. .
