DOCTOR: Hello Mykeisha, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kamahele, nice to meet you too. Well, the nurse told me to come in 'cause my blood pressure was a little high at the last check-up. It's been a bit up and down, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little up and down, I see. That's good you’re getting it checked, and good that the nurse flagged it. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... It’s not like really high all the time, you know? Sometimes it feels normal when I check it at the pharmacy. But other times, especially if I'm stressed or tired, it feels… heavier, I guess? I don't really know what the numbers mean, to be honest. I just know it doesn't feel right when it's high.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly okay not to know the numbers—that's what I’m here for! "Heavier" is a good way to put it, actually. Do you happen to remember roughly when you started noticing this—when it began feeling up and down?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a good question. Let me see… probably around… maybe six months ago? It was around the time my aunt got sick. I was doing a lot of running back and forth to the hospital, trying to help out, and I definitely wasn’t sleeping well. It’s been kinda stressful ever since, even after… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds very difficult, and stress can certainly play a role. Six months ago, with the added stress… Okay. And besides the feeling of it being “heavier”, have you noticed any other symptoms when your blood pressure feels higher?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I don’t get headaches or anything. Sometimes I feel a little bit dizzy, but I just figured that was from not eating enough, or being tired. I haven't really put the two together, to be honest. Now that you ask though… maybe the dizziness happens a little more when I'm feeling stressed. It's not bad, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable dizziness along with the stress. That's helpful. Now, just to get a full picture, have you been having any chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes at all?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And I can breathe just fine, thank goodness. My vision's been okay too. Everything looks normal as far as I can tell. I wear glasses for reading, but that's been the same for years.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the flu pretty bad a couple years ago, but that’s it. Oh, and I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, the doctor told me. It’s not too bad, just a little stiffness sometimes, especially in the mornings. But that's all, I think. I usually try to stay pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the hands and the flu a couple of years ago. And you generally feel healthy, that's wonderful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Never needed 'em, thankfully. And I'm pretty careful, so hopefully won't need any!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom, she had high blood pressure too, when she got older. She was okay, she took some pills for it, and she lived a good long life. My dad, he was healthy as a horse, never had any problems. And my brother's fine, as far as I know. Everyone on both sides is pretty much okay, health-wise. Oh, my grandma on my father's side had diabetes, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mom had high blood pressure, and your grandma had diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! I can take most things without any problems. Food, medicine, everything. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That's excellent! And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my hands when the arthritis is acting up. That’s it, really. Nothing regular. Just the basics, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands. It'll just take a few minutes. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your hands have some mild swelling in the knuckles, consistent with arthritis. No significant redness or warmth.
PATIENT: Okay. 148 over 92… is that bad? That sounds… high, doesn’t it? I figured it would be a little high 'cause I was a bit nervous coming here, but…
DOCTOR: It's a bit higher than we'd like to see, yes, but it's not an emergency. It's good you mentioned being nervous, that can definitely raise it temporarily. However, given your mom’s history, and the readings the nurse took, we need to investigate a bit further. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. We should also do an EKG, just to make sure everything looks good with your heart. It's a standard precaution.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. I guess if it's what you think is best. I don't really like needles, but… if it's to make sure everything's alright, I'll do it. How long will it take, and will I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the needles – it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood work will take just a few minutes, and the phlebotomist will be very gentle. You will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood work, so no food or sugary drinks. You can still drink water. We'll schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning, that way you won’t have to fast for too long. In the meantime, let’s talk about some lifestyle changes that can help lower your blood pressure. We can discuss diet, exercise, and stress management. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. I mean, I know I should be eating better, and I definitely don’t get enough exercise. Stress… that's a hard one, but I can try. What kinda things are you thinking? I don’t want to give up all my favorite foods, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely—we're not aiming for perfection, just making small, sustainable changes. Reducing your salt intake is a big one—try to avoid processed foods as much as possible, and read labels carefully. Eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is also helpful. As for exercise, even 30 minutes of brisk walking most days of the week can make a difference. And for stress… well, that's more individual. Things like deep breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, or even spending time in nature can be very effective. We can also explore some stress management techniques together if you’d like. Have you ever tried any relaxation exercises before?
PATIENT: No, never really tried any of those things. I used to love gardening, but I haven’t had time for that lately. Deep breathing… I guess I can try that. Is there a particular way to do it? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay—it's never too late to start. Gardening is wonderful—we should try to get you back to that when you have time! And deep breathing is very simple. Just find a quiet place to sit or lie down, and focus on your breath. Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose, filling your belly with air, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Try to make your exhales longer than your inhales. We can find some guided meditation resources online if you’d like. For now, let’s schedule those blood tests and EKG for tomorrow morning. I'll also give you a handout with information on healthy eating and stress management. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and create a more specific plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good, actually. I appreciate you not making me feel bad about everything. And yeah, the handouts would be helpful, so I don't forget. I guess… let's get the tests done. I'm ready to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. We'll get those tests scheduled right away, and the nurse will provide you with the handouts. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
