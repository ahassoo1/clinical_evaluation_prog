DOCTOR: Hi Soila, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my tummy feels big. Bigger than usual, you know? And I don’t want to eat much. Not like before. It just… doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your stomach feels bigger than usual and you've lost some of your appetite. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh dear… time. It’s hard to say, really. Maybe… a few weeks? Or longer? Everything is a bit… fuzzy these days. It feels like it’s been a while, that’s for sure. I don't keep good track, you see.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we'll figure it out. A few weeks or longer is helpful. And has anything changed in those few weeks – besides your appetite and feeling bigger?
PATIENT: Changed…? Let me think. Hmmm… I feel a little tired, maybe? But I’m always a little tired, you know, at my age. Oh! And… sometimes my tummy feels… uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly. Just… full, and heavy. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, increased tiredness and a feeling of fullness or heaviness in your abdomen. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – anything different with going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh, you mean… going to the bathroom? Well… not really. It’s all… pretty normal, I think. Maybe a little less often? But I don't always remember those things, you see. Old age, it’s a terrible thing for memory!
DOCTOR: Okay, a little less frequent bowel movements. And have you experienced any nausea or vomiting at all?
PATIENT: Nausea…? Oh, that’s when you… feel sick to your tummy, yes? No, no sickness. I haven’t thrown up. Just… not hungry. It’s a strange feeling. Everything tastes… bland, even the things I used to like. Is this something bad, Doctor? I worry sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you haven’t had any nausea or vomiting. A change in appetite and taste can be a sign of a few different things, so we’ll need to look into it a bit more. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your tummy and feeling it, to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Listening and feeling… that sounds good. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s just… worrying is tiring too.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could lie back on the examination table for me, that would be perfect. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with this, and then gently feel around. It might be a little cool, but I’ll try to be as gentle as possible. Okay… breathing normally for me… I'm not hearing any unusual sounds. And… Your abdomen is a little distended, as you said. It's also a bit tender when I press here on the lower left side. No masses that I can feel at this point. Okay, that gives me some information. I also want to check your weight, if that’s alright. Just to see if there’s been any recent change.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Weight, yes. I haven't been feeling as strong lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if I've lost some. Do you think it's something serious, Doctor? I get frightened easily, you know. Old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Soila, and I appreciate you telling me that you get frightened easily. We’re just gathering information right now, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Gathering information. Yes. That’s good. Information is always good. What kind of information are we gathering, exactly? Will there be… needles? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay. No needles yet. We’re starting with some basic information. I've noted your weight, and you mentioned some changes in appetite and bowel habits. I want to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Just to get a fuller picture. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions… That was a long time ago, Doctor. So long ago… I remember being sick sometimes, like everyone. But diagnosed…? I don’t think so. Maybe a little trouble with my blood pressure once, but the doctor said it was just from stress. I lived a very… exciting life, you know. Lots of traveling. I don’t think I have any serious conditions. Mostly just old age aches and pains. I was a sociologist, you see. Always busy. Always thinking. Not much time for doctors.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major diagnosed conditions. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmmm… let me think. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. They fixed it, I think. And… oh! When I was very old, they took out my gallbladder. That was a long time ago. And… I don't think that's all. My memory is not so good, you know. It’s like… a lot of things happened, but they are… fuzzy. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we'll take it slow. So, a broken arm as a child and gallbladder removal. That's helpful. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she died when I was young. I think she had something with her heart. And my brother… he was always sickly. Something with his lungs, maybe? But they didn’t have good doctors back then, you know. Lots of people got sick. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it. They didn’t talk about these things much, you see. Not a very healthy family, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, no. Not really. Sometimes I take a little something for my… aches and pains, you know? But it’s just… a little something from the drugstore. Not a prescription. It doesn’t really help much, to be honest. I mostly just… rest when I feel bad. And drink tea. Lots of tea. Do you think I should be taking something, Doctor? Perhaps that would help.
DOCTOR: Okay. No regular medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just from the dust, you see. And I don’t eat much shellfish, because I don’t like the taste. But I’m not allergic, exactly. Just… don’t like it. I’m a pretty simple person, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Old age has made me… resilient, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Soila. Now, I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will give us more information about your overall health, and the CT scan will help us see what’s going on inside your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a CT scan? And blood work? What will the CT scan show? Is it… painful? And the blood work… will it hurt? I don't like needles, you see. I really don't. Is it very serious, Doctor? Is something very wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, take a deep breath. Let’s talk about this. The CT scan is a special kind of X-ray that takes pictures of the inside of your body. It doesn’t hurt at all – you just lie still on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It's like a very detailed photograph. And yes, the blood work does involve a small needle, but it’s very quick, and the nurse is very good at it. It might sting for a moment, but it’s over very quickly. We're doing these tests just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I don't want to jump to any conclusions or scare you. The tests will give us more information so we can figure out the best way to help you feel better. It's better to be safe and know what we're dealing with. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A photograph… that sounds a little better. And a quick sting… I suppose I can manage a quick sting. But what if the photograph shows something… bad? What if it is something very serious? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don't want to… cause trouble. It’s just… I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Soila, you are not a burden. And whatever the tests show, we’ll face it together. It’s important to remember that knowing what’s going on is always better than not knowing. And even if it is something serious, there are often things we can do to help. I'll explain everything to you clearly, and we’ll discuss all of your options. And I will make sure you have support every step of the way. We can start with the blood work today. If you're up for it, the nurse can come in and take a sample right now. Then we'll schedule the CT scan for later this week. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, I suppose. If you promise to explain everything… and if you promise to take care of me. Blood work today… and a photograph later. But please, Doctor, be gentle. And… don’t let me fall. I get dizzy sometimes. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a kind woman. I feel a little better now, just knowing you’re here.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I promise to be gentle and I will make sure you’re well taken care of. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. She'll come in shortly to take the blood sample. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. And please, don't hesitate to call out if you feel dizzy at any point. We'll get through this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind.
