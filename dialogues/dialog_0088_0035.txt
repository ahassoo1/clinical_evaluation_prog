DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Piet! It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop! It's been going on for… oh, goodness, a few days now, I reckon. Not constantly, but they pop up at the strangest times. Quite embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of hiccups. That can be bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, they don't hurt, not at all. It’s just… a jolt, you know? Like someone gave me a little poke inside. And they come and go. Yesterday, I was perfectly fine all morning, then they started up while I was having my tea. And then they’d stop for a bit, and start again when I was chatting with old Mrs. Gable next door. It doesn't seem to have a pattern, if that makes sense? I’ve tried holding my breath, like my mum used to tell me, but that doesn’t seem to do much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just a jolting sensation. And they seem to be happening somewhat randomly, not related to eating or activity, and holding your breath isn’t helping. Okay. Have you noticed anything before they start?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… Before they start… Well, now that you mention it, sometimes I get a little bit of a… fluttery feeling in my chest, just before. Not a bad feeling, mind you, just… awareness, I suppose? Like my heart does a little skip. And sometimes, if I've been talking a lot, they seem to come on after that. But it's not every time, you understand. I really can't put my finger on a specific thing that triggers them. It’s just… random. I do spend a lot of time visiting with people, though, at the community center. Perhaps all that talking tires me out?
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttery feeling in your chest sometimes before the hiccups, and potentially related to talking. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit more generally. Have you had any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… No, not really. No fever, no cough, no tummy troubles. Everything else feels perfectly normal, thank you. I’ve been sleeping alright, eating alright… Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just old age creeping up on me, I reckon! My appetite's been good, thankfully. I still enjoy a good plate of kokoda, when my daughter makes it. And I haven’t noticed any trouble breathing or anything like that. Just the hiccups! It’s really quite a mystery, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a mystery, yes. And it's good to hear everything else feels normal. Now, have you been taking any medications currently, Mirriam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just my usuals, Doctor. I take a little pill for my blood pressure – losartan, I think it's called – and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me I was a bit low last year. And sometimes, if my arthritis flares up, I take a bit of naproxen, but not very often. That’s about it, really. Nothing new, nothing different. I’m usually pretty good about taking my pills, though, I don't like to mess with things!
DOCTOR: Okay, losartan for blood pressure, vitamin D, and naproxen as needed for arthritis. Good to know. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, thankfully. Never had any trouble with any pills or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky in that regard. My daughter always worries about me, but I've always been a pretty sturdy Fijian woman! She makes me tell her every time I see a doctor, just to be sure. And I always tell her the truth, of course. She's a good girl, my daughter.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Mirriam, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My knees aren’t what they used to be, so I might need a little help getting up afterwards, if that’s alright. But for now, I’m fine. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just listening to your heart and lungs now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72. Throat looks clear. Ears are clear as well. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically. No obvious cause for the hiccups jumping out at me.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, Doctor. Well, as good as can be, I suppose, if you can’t find anything wrong. It’s just… frustrating, you know? To have something bothering you and not know why. Perhaps it's just one of those things that will go away on its own? I don't want to bother you too much if it’s nothing serious. I have a community center meeting later, so I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden at all, Mirriam. It's my job to investigate these things. Given your age and the lack of any other symptoms, and the normal physical exam, the most likely explanation is benign, temporary hiccups. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something else, even if rare. Since you’re on losartan, we’ll want to rule out any medication side effect, though it’s less common. I'm going to order a basic blood work panel, just to check your electrolytes and kidney function. It'll also include a CBC to rule out any subtle infection. It’s a simple test, and we can get the results back quickly. In the meantime, continue trying the usual remedies – sipping water, holding your breath… although it doesn’t seem to be helping much. If the hiccups worsen, become constant, or you develop any other symptoms – like chest pain, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing – please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems reasonable, if it can rule things out. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s good to know you’re not just dismissing it. Yes, I will definitely call if anything changes, you can be sure of that. And I will try to remember everything you said. My daughter will remind me if I forget, of course! So, the blood work… do I need to make another appointment for that, or can I get it done here?
DOCTOR: You can get it done right here in the clinic lab. I'll write you a lab requisition now, and the phlebotomist will take care of it. It should only take about 15 minutes. Afterwards, you're free to go. We'll have the results back within a couple of days, and we can discuss them then. I'll have the nurse call you with the results, or you can schedule a quick follow-up if you prefer. And don't worry too much, Mirriam. It’s likely nothing serious. Just good to check. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, thank you, Doctor. Getting it done here is very convenient. No, I don’t think I have any more questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate your kindness and patience. I’ll just let the nurse know if I want to schedule a follow-up. Thank you again for everything. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And enjoy your community center meeting!
