DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine, I believe. Oh, dear… what does bring me in? It’s… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, you see. Quite severe when it does come, though. I… I seem to have trouble remembering all the details these days. Something about… a condition? A longstanding one. I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it’s quite alright. We can certainly work through it. A longstanding condition… hmm. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describing it… it’s… cramping, mostly. Like a very tight squeezing. And sometimes… sharp. Very sharp. It comes in waves, I think. Not constant, thankfully. It feels… deep inside, you understand? Not just on the surface. And it’s been… fluctuating. Worse some days than others, naturally. Is that helpful, Doctor? I do hope I’m not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, no, this is helpful. Fluctuating cramping and sharp pains, deep inside… I see. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a difficult question. The pain itself? The recent bouts of it, I’d say… a few weeks, perhaps? But… the underlying condition… well, that’s been with me for a very long time. Years, certainly. Decades, even. It’s… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, isn’t it? Or something along those lines? My memory… it’s just not what it used to be, you see. I apologize again for my inability to recall specifics. I’ve seen many doctors over the years, and the details blur.
DOCTOR: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus… Yes, I do see a history of that here, diagnosed in 1998. And you are correct, it does indicate a long history of flare-ups and remissions. We’ll certainly factor that into our assessment. Now, aside from this pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know you have that information. It’s a weight off my mind, truly. Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I’ve been rather fatigued lately, more so than usual. And… my joints ache. Not constantly, but on and off. Mostly my hands and knees, I believe. And… sometimes I feel a bit feverish, though I haven't actually taken my temperature to confirm. It’s more of a general feeling of being unwell, if that makes sense. Oh, and I've been a bit… forgetful, naturally. Though that’s hardly new, is it? Is that helpful? I do try to remember everything, Doctor, but it's quite a struggle.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, joint pain – hands and knees specifically – and a feeling of being feverish… Yes, this is all relevant, Ms. Glymph. Now, has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh, dear. That’s… a personal question, isn't it? Well, yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been… irregular, shall we say? More frequent trips to the restroom, and… not as formed as usual. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as it seemed… unrelated to the pain. But you’re quite right to ask, Doctor. It's been occurring intermittently for the past week or so, alongside the increasing pain. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Ms. Glymph. Changes in bowel habits can be significant. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a rather unpleasant question. Well, yes. There has been… a small amount. Not every time, thankfully, but on a few occasions. It’s… bright red. I noticed it after wiping. It wasn't a large amount, Doctor, but it was there. I was hesitant to mention it, as I… well, I was hoping it was simply a matter of…hemorrhoids, perhaps? I apologize for my awkwardness. This is not a comfortable topic, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it is not. And it’s important that you told me. Bright red blood in the stool, alongside your history of Lupus and recent abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, warrants further investigation. I would like to perform a physical exam, if you are comfortable with that. It will involve palpating your abdomen and listening to your bowel sounds. After that, we’ll need to order some lab work, and I think a colonoscopy would be prudent. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate your attentiveness. A physical exam is perfectly acceptable. And the lab work, of course. A colonoscopy… that sounds a bit daunting, if I’m honest, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. I want to get to the bottom of this, naturally. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. Please, proceed as you see fit. And thank you, Doctor, for taking me seriously. I've sometimes felt dismissed in the past.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It’s my job to take your concerns seriously, and we will investigate this thoroughly. Let’s begin with the physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. I am also palpating your abdomen now... There’s some tenderness in the lower quadrants, primarily on the left side. Do you feel any pain specifically when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s… quite tender there. On the left side, you’re right. It’s not excruciating, but it’s… uncomfortable. A dull ache, mostly. It’s… similar to the pain I’ve been experiencing, but more localized. It seems to… radiate outwards a bit, if that makes sense. It’s… a bit alarming, honestly. I do hope it’s nothing too concerning. Please, continue with your examination, Doctor. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. The exam reveals some tenderness and guarding in the lower quadrants, particularly on the left, which correlates with your reported pain. I will now order some lab work. This will include a complete blood count to assess for any signs of infection or anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to check for inflammation, and a stool sample to rule out any infection. Given your history of Lupus and your current symptoms, I also recommend a colonoscopy to rule out any structural abnormalities in your colon. We will also need to discuss potential imaging, such as a CT scan, if the initial lab results are inconclusive. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… comprehensive. All of it. The labs, the colonoscopy, the potential imaging… I understand the need for thoroughness, naturally. It's… a bit overwhelming, honestly, but I trust your judgment. I want to get to the bottom of this, as quickly as possible. Please, proceed as you see fit. And… thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and attentiveness. What is the next step, specifically? Do I need to schedule the colonoscopy immediately?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I understand it's overwhelming, and we’ll take it one step at a time. The next step is to get the lab work done. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule the colonoscopy. It’s best to schedule it relatively soon, ideally within the next week or two, to get a definitive diagnosis. I’ll have the nurse give you preparation instructions for the colonoscopy once it’s scheduled. It requires a special diet and bowel preparation beforehand, so it’s important to follow the instructions carefully. Do you have any questions about the lab work or the colonoscopy preparation at this point?
PATIENT: A week or two… yes, that seems reasonable. The preparation… that sounds… unpleasant, if I’m honest. Will it be… difficult? And… will it interfere with my usual medications? I take a low dose of methotrexate for the Lupus, and I wouldn’t want to disrupt that without guidance. Also… will I be sedated for the colonoscopy? I've heard… mixed things. And… oh dear. I seem to have so many questions. I apologize for being so… demanding. It’s just… I’m rather anxious about all of this.
DOCTOR: You are not being demanding at all, Ms. Glymph. These are excellent questions, and it’s important that you feel comfortable and informed. The bowel preparation can be unpleasant, I won’t lie. It involves drinking a large volume of a special solution that causes diarrhea to cleanse your colon. However, there are different preparations available, and we can discuss which one might be best for you to minimize discomfort. Regarding your methotrexate, it’s crucial to stop taking it a few days before the colonoscopy, as it can interfere with the healing process if there’s any bleeding. We will provide specific instructions on when to stop and restart it. And yes, you will be sedated for the colonoscopy. We typically use a combination of medications to ensure you are comfortable and relaxed during the procedure. You likely won’t remember much, if anything, about it. I will have the nurse provide you with detailed written instructions for both the bowel preparation and your medication adjustments. Do you have any other concerns at this point?
PATIENT: That… that is reassuring, Doctor. Knowing I’ll be sedated is a great comfort. And the detailed instructions… yes, that will be extremely helpful. I’m still a bit anxious about the preparation, naturally, but I suppose it’s unavoidable. One last question, if you don’t mind. Will I need someone to drive me home after the colonoscopy? And… how long is the recovery process, typically? I live alone, you see, and I wouldn’t want to be stranded if I’m unable to drive. I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I truly do.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. These are all very important questions, and it’s good you’re asking them. Yes, you absolutely will need someone to drive you home after the colonoscopy. You will be sedated, and it’s unsafe and illegal to drive yourself. You also shouldn’t make any important decisions for several hours after the procedure due to the sedation. The recovery process is typically quite straightforward. You may feel some cramping and bloating after the colonoscopy, but this usually subsides within a few hours. You’ll likely be able to resume your normal activities the following day, though you should avoid strenuous exercise for a week. We’ll provide detailed post-procedure instructions, including what to eat and drink, and when to contact us if you experience any complications. The nurse will go over all of this with you in detail before you leave. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that answers everything. You've been incredibly thorough and patient, and I truly appreciate your kindness. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. I suppose I’ll wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Eaddy. You’ve been a great comfort.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. The nurse will be in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any further questions. .
