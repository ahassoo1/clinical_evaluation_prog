DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. That sounds… concerning. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about what you were told about the cancer?
PATIENT: Um… it was the hospital, a few weeks ago. They said… they said it was in my lungs. And… they said I needed to see someone about treatment, and my regular doctor sent me to you. I don’t… I don’t really know much else. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chellsea. It is a lot to take in, and it’s understandable that things feel fast and overwhelming. I see here from the hospital reports that you did have some findings on a chest X-ray that prompted further investigation. It looks like a CT scan was also performed. Before we discuss those findings in detail, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… yes. I… I get tired very easily. Like, much more easily than before. And sometimes I have a cough, but it doesn’t… it doesn’t bring anything up. Just a dry cough. And… sometimes it hurts to breathe, a little bit. Not all the time, but sometimes. It feels like… like a tight feeling in my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, a dry cough, and some chest tightness with breathing. When did you first start noticing these symptoms, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think the tiredness started first, maybe… three or four months ago? But I just thought I was working too much. I… I didn’t really pay much attention to it then. The cough… that started more recently, maybe a month or so ago. And the chest tightness… that’s been happening just in the last few weeks, I think. Around the same time as the hospital visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the fatigue has been present the longest, followed by the cough and then the chest tightness coinciding with the hospital visit. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No… not really. I mean… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, maybe? But I haven’t been eating very well, so I’m not sure if that’s related. It’s hard to say. I… I haven’t really been keeping track. I don’t feel sick, not like with a cold or anything. Just… tired. A lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue, dry cough, chest tightness, and some unintentional weight loss. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I… I had pneumonia once, when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And… I have some arthritis in my hands, but it’s not very bad. It doesn’t bother me much. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child and mild arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've… I've always been pretty healthy, until this. I mean, besides the arthritis. I… I don't really go to the doctor much, unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she passed away a few years ago. She had… heart problems. And my father… he has diabetes. And… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had cancer, I think. Lung cancer, maybe? I don’t… I don’t really know much about it. It was a long time ago. I… I wasn’t very close to her.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and a possible history of lung cancer in your maternal grandmother. Do you know if anyone else in your family has had cancer?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. My family… we don’t really talk about things like that much. I… I don’t think anyone else has, but I’m not really sure. I… I haven’t asked. It’s… it’s not something we talk about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. I’m an occupational therapist. I… I help people with disabilities. It’s… it’s a good job, but it’s… tiring. I live alone. I… I don’t really have a lot of hobbies. I used to like hiking, but… I haven’t been able to do that lately. I… I mostly just work and sleep. And now… this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Occupational therapist, living alone. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… I don’t like smoking. It’s… bad for you. I… I try to be healthy, even though… even though I’m tired a lot. I… I don’t drink much either. Maybe a glass of wine sometimes, with dinner. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking or excessive alcohol use. Are you allergic to any medications, or do you have any other allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I… I don’t take any medications regularly. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for my arthritis. Like ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for that information, Chellsea. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I… I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a few deep breaths for me. I’m hearing some… diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. It’s subtle, but noticeable. I’m also going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 88, and temperature is 98.6. Within normal limits. I’m also going to palpate your lymph nodes, and check your hands for any swelling or redness related to your arthritis. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Hands show mild tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal joints, consistent with arthritis, but no significant swelling or redness. Finally, I’ll check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, which is good. Okay, Chellsea. That completes the physical exam. I’ve documented all my findings.
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds like a lot. What does it mean? Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It is a lot of information. The diminished breath sounds I heard are something we need to investigate further. They suggest there might be some fluid or obstruction in the lower part of your lungs. The tenderness in your hands is consistent with your arthritis, but doesn’t appear to be contributing to the symptoms you’re experiencing now. Based on the hospital reports and my exam, we need to determine the cause of these findings. The reports indicate a possible mass or inflammation in the lungs. I want to be upfront: this could be a number of things, and we need more information to understand what's going on. Do you have access to the reports from the hospital?
PATIENT: Um… I think so. I have a folder with all the papers. They gave me a lot of papers. I… I haven’t really looked at them very closely. It was just… too much. It scared me.
DOCTOR: That’s completely understandable. It’s a lot to process. I would like to review those reports with you. We can go through them together, and I can explain what they mean in plain language. Based on those reports, we'll likely need to order some additional tests to get a clearer picture. This might include a CT scan of your chest with contrast, and potentially a biopsy of any suspicious areas. The biopsy is the most important test to determine exactly what is going on. We may also want to check your blood work, including a complete blood count and some tumor markers. Does that sound alright to you, Chellsea?
PATIENT: Um… a biopsy? That… that sounds scary. What does it involve? And… what if it is cancer? I… I don’t know if I can…
DOCTOR: It’s completely natural to be scared, Chellsea. A biopsy does sound intimidating, and it's okay to feel anxious about it. There are different types of biopsies, and the type we would use depends on where the suspicious area is located. Typically, it involves taking a small sample of tissue from the lungs using a needle guided by imaging, like a CT scan. It’s usually done with local anesthesia, so you wouldn’t feel much discomfort during the procedure. As for “what if it is cancer,” it’s important to remember that we don’t know that yet. We need the biopsy results to confirm or rule that out. If it is cancer, there are many treatment options available, and we would work with a team of specialists – including oncologists – to develop a plan that’s right for you. We would discuss all of your options, and make sure you understand everything. Right now, we need to focus on getting more information. Would you be comfortable with me ordering the CT scan with contrast?
PATIENT: …Okay. A CT scan. I… I guess so. If it helps to find out what’s going on. But… please, no scary surprises. Just… tell me everything in plain language. And… be honest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Chellsea. That’s my promise to you. We will take things one step at a time. I will explain everything in plain language, and I will be honest with you every step of the way. No scary surprises. We'll review the results together, and discuss all of your options. I'm going to write an order for a CT scan of your chest with contrast. We'll need to schedule it at the radiology department. Do you have a preferred time or day?
PATIENT: I… I don’t have any preferences. Whatever is easiest. I work most days, but… I can try to make time. I just… I just want to get this over with. And… find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see they have some availability tomorrow afternoon, or Friday morning. Does either of those times work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow afternoon might be best, if that’s okay. I… I think I can get off work. I’ll have to ask my boss, but… I’ll try. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. You’re scheduled for a CT scan tomorrow at 2:00 PM at the radiology department. Here’s the appointment slip with the address and instructions. It’s important to let them know if you have any allergies, especially to contrast dye. They may ask you to refrain from eating or drinking for a few hours before the scan, so make sure to ask them about that when you arrive. I will also order some routine blood work to get a baseline. We can do that here at the clinic, or you can have it done at a lab of your choice. Do you have any questions for me right now, Chellsea?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. I’m… I’m still scared, but… thank you. For explaining everything. And… for being honest. I… I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. It's okay to be scared. We'll face this together. I’ll follow up with you after the CT scan to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s my direct extension number, and the clinic’s main number. Take care, and try not to worry too much until we have more information. We’ll get through this.
