DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been terribly thirsty lately, and… oddly hungry, too. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to become quite bothersome. I suppose that’s the main reason for the visit.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry... and how long is "a little while," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… perhaps three or four weeks now? It started gradually, just feeling a bit more parched than usual, and a little more appetite. But it’s definitely increased over the last week or so. It's not… debilitating, but it's enough to notice, and it's making it difficult to concentrate on things. I'd like to get it sorted, if possible.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed in your diet or activity level around the time this started?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall, Doctor. No, things have been fairly… regular, I suppose. Same routine, same meals, same amount of walking. I haven’t taken up any new hobbies or anything that would explain it. It’s rather perplexing, to be honest. I’m usually quite good at noticing when things change, but this just… appeared.
DOCTOR: No changes in diet or activity... Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, not really. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but I put that down to the general stress of things, you know? Nothing else jumps to mind. No dizziness, no… frequent need to use the restroom, nothing like that. Just the thirst and the hunger. I hope that helps narrow it down.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, no frequent urination… Alright. Do you have a family history of diabetes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Diabetes… that’s a bit of a worrying thought, isn’t it? Let me think… my mother’s side, my grandfather, I believe, had it. Yes, that’s right. Type 2, I think they said. It was quite a long time ago, though. I don't believe anyone else on either side had it. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, yes. And do you know if he experienced similar symptoms before diagnosis?
PATIENT: That's a good question... I wasn't very old at the time, so I don't recall the specifics. I seem to remember him being quite tired all the time, and losing some weight. But honestly, it’s a bit hazy. My aunt might know more, she was closer to him than I was. Would it be helpful to check with her?
DOCTOR: Perhaps later, if necessary. Alright. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I prefer to get everything I need from my diet, when I can. Though, admittedly, the increased appetite is making that a bit more challenging.
DOCTOR: No medications or supplements…Alright. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Food, animals, pollen… nothing. I'm quite fortunate, in that regard. I think my wife used to joke I could eat anything, but… well, that’s another story. I digress. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just some basic checks – blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your general condition. It will help me to better assess what might be going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I'd like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible, so anything you can do to help is appreciated. I trust your professional judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just step over here and sit on the table, we can get started. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No noticeable masses. Finally, I’m going to check your weight. Please step on the scale.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. It hasn't changed much recently, I don’t think. I’ve been trying to maintain it, but… well, with the increased appetite, it’s a little harder.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. That confirms a slightly elevated BMI. Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Based on your symptoms – increased thirst and hunger, family history of diabetes, and slightly elevated blood pressure and BMI – I think it would be prudent to run some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your blood glucose levels, as well as a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall kidney and liver function. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. That sounds sensible. I'd rather be cautious, and if blood tests are the next step, then please proceed. I trust your judgement completely. The sooner we have an answer, the better. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: Very good. I will have the nurse draw some blood samples right away. It will take a few minutes. While we wait, I’ll just document everything we’ve discussed today. In the meantime, it’s important to note that these tests are just to help us understand what’s going on. I don’t want to cause undue alarm. However, it's always best to be proactive. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your methodical approach. I suppose I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you for your time so far. I’m hoping for some clarity soon. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime – dietary changes, anything like that? Or should I just continue as normal?
DOCTOR: While we await the results, it would be best to avoid sugary drinks and excessive carbohydrates. Focus on a balanced diet with plenty of protein and fiber. Don’t drastically change anything, but be mindful of your intake. And, importantly, continue to monitor your thirst and hunger. Note how much water you’re drinking and what you’re eating. This information could be helpful when we review the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Avoid sugary drinks, moderate carbohydrates, and keep a note of my intake. Nothing drastic, just mindful. I can certainly do that. It's not a major inconvenience, and it might even be beneficial regardless of the outcome. Thank you for the advice. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse, then. I appreciate your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we'll discuss them. Please let me know if you feel any new or worsening symptoms in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
