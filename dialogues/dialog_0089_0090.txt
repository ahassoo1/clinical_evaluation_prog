DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I'm here for… a clearance, I believe? For a surgery I’m hoping to have. It's… cosmetic. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t recall all the specifics right now.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright. Cosmetic surgery clearance – understood. Just to be clear, do you remember what type of cosmetic surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think it has to do with… my face? Perhaps something with the skin? It was recommended by a specialist, and I went through some consultations, but the details are… quite hazy, I’m afraid. It feels silly to not remember. Was there paperwork I filled out beforehand that might help?
DOCTOR: No worries, it’s not silly at all. Sometimes details get lost. Let me pull up your file… Ah, here we are. It says you're scheduled for a facelift with Dr. Ramirez. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… yes! That’s it! A facelift. That does sound correct. He was very… kind. It was quite a while ago, though. So, this clearance is to make sure I’m healthy enough for it, then?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We just need to make sure everything looks good from a medical perspective before you proceed. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any current medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart conditions, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t believe so. I was… quite healthy, for the most part. My husband… he always took care of the details. After he passed… things became a bit… muddled. I do have a private insurance plan, if that's relevant? I can’t recall the specifics of any conditions, but I had regular check-ups with a general practitioner before… everything.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mackenzi. Insurance is relevant, good to know. And it’s completely understandable things are a bit unclear. We can dig through records if needed. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was a child, I think? A very long time ago. And… I believe I had a minor procedure on my knee once, a sports injury in my youth, but it was nothing major. Definitely not a full surgery, just… something to help it heal. I truly apologize for being so vague, Doctor. It’s incredibly frustrating.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly okay. We’ll take it slowly. And knowing about the appendix removal and the knee procedure is helpful. Now, how about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My family is back in Colombia, and we haven’t been in close contact for quite some time. I know my mother had some… heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my father… he was a very strong man, but I don’t recall any specific illnesses he suffered from. I’m afraid I don’t have much detailed information, Doctor. It wasn’t something we discussed often.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We’ll make a note of the heart trouble in your mother’s history. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I used to enjoy trying different foods when my husband and I traveled… but no, no allergies that I’m aware of. I can't say with absolute certainty, but I’m fairly confident.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see... No, not currently. I think I used to take a multivitamin, but I haven’t kept up with it for… well, for a long time now. Everything became rather disorganized after... after my husband. No prescription medications, nothing. Just the occasional headache, and I’d take… ibuprofen, I suppose. But nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. That’s a good start. Now, to get a better picture of your current health, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do, please. I want to be sure I'm in the best possible health for this surgery.
DOCTOR: Great. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is normal. Your heart sounds regular, and lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Now, just going to take a look at your throat and ears. Throat looks clear, and ears are normal as well. Everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Do you have any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. I do sometimes experience a bit of stiffness in my neck and shoulders, but that's more from… tension, I think. Nothing that requires any medication or attention, just… discomfort. It tends to come and go. It’s nothing to worry about, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. And just to get a complete picture, I’d like to ask about a few lifestyle factors. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he wasn't a fan. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a very quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mackenzi. That’s good to know. Now, lastly, can you tell me a little about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a bit difficult to answer truthfully, Doctor. Before… before my husband passed, we were very active. We enjoyed cooking together, eating healthy meals, and going for long walks. After… everything, my appetite diminished. I don’t cook much anymore. I tend to eat… simpler meals. Things that are easy to prepare. Frozen dinners, mostly. And I don’t exercise much, I’m afraid. It's… hard to find the motivation. I try to get out for a walk occasionally, but it’s not a regular thing. I apologize. I’m not very good at taking care of myself these days.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been through a lot, Mackenzi, and it's completely understandable that your lifestyle has changed. It’s not about judging, just getting a full picture. Given your history and the physical exam, everything seems within normal limits for a facelift. However, given your diet and lack of exercise, I recommend a pre-operative cardiac evaluation just to be safe. It’s a standard precaution. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If that's what you recommend, then I completely agree. I want to be as prepared as possible. A cardiac evaluation… that sounds good. I trust your judgment. Where would I go for that, and what does it involve? I’m sorry to ask so many questions, I just… want to understand everything.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi, questions are good! I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Chen, a cardiologist just down the street. He'll likely do an EKG, a blood test to check your cholesterol and other levels, and may recommend a stress test depending on his findings. He’ll explain everything in detail. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we can discuss moving forward with the surgery clearance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Dr. Chen, down the street… excellent. I’ll schedule an appointment with him as soon as possible. Thank you for being so thorough, and for understanding. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be doing to prepare, besides scheduling the appointment with Dr. Chen?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. For now, just focus on scheduling that appointment. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, and if possible, try to incorporate some gentle walking into your routine, even just a short stroll each day. It’ll be good for you. I'll also send this referral electronically to Dr. Chen’s office to expedite the process. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered everything I was wondering, and explained everything so clearly. Thank you again for your time, and for your kindness. I feel much better prepared now. I’ll schedule the appointment with Dr. Chen right away. I appreciate everything you’ve done.
