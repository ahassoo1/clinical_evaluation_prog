DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…well, numbness in my leg. It’s been happening on and off for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your leg. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. "On and off" is helpful—can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It doesn’t happen constantly, thankfully. Usually, it starts in my foot, sort of a tingling sensation, and then it moves up my leg, to my calf mostly. It comes and goes throughout the day. Sometimes it’s just a slight…lack of feeling, other times it feels almost…pins and needles, if that makes sense. It doesn’t seem to be tied to any particular activity, which is what’s a bit concerning. I’ve been trying to pay attention to what I’m doing when it starts, but I haven’t noticed a clear pattern.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s really helpful. So, tingling that starts in the foot, moves up to the calf, and it’s not consistently linked to an activity. And it can range from just a lack of feeling to pins and needles. Do you experience any weakness in your leg at all, or any pain alongside the numbness?
PATIENT: No weakness that I’ve noticed, thankfully. I do a fair bit of walking and standing for my work, and I haven't tripped or felt unstable. As for pain, there’s sometimes a slight ache with the numbness, but it’s not severe. It's more of a…discomfort than actual pain, if that makes sense. It’s hard to describe. It’s like when your foot “falls asleep” and then wakes up, but it lingers a bit longer and doesn’t always go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, “discomfort” is a good way to put it, and that comparison to a foot falling asleep is helpful. It’s good to know you haven’t noticed any weakness. Just to get a fuller picture, can you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m a special effects artist and animator, mostly freelance. It involves a lot of being on my feet – setting up equipment, moving things around on set, that sort of thing. I also spend a considerable amount of time at a computer, designing and rendering animations. It’s a mix of physical work and being stationary, I suppose. I do try to take breaks and stretch, but sometimes deadlines get a little…tight. I’ve been doing this professionally for about five years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense. So, a combination of physical work and prolonged computer use. Five years is good to know. Now, let's talk a little more generally. Have you had any injuries to your back, hips, or legs in the past?
PATIENT: No major injuries, thankfully. I sprained my ankle badly when I was younger – about ten years ago, playing basketball – but it healed completely, and hasn’t bothered me since. I've had the occasional muscle strain from lifting things at work, but nothing that required a doctor's visit or physical therapy. I’m generally quite careful about lifting properly, and I’ve never fallen or had any significant trauma to my legs or back. I did have a bout of pretty bad sciatica a few years back, but that resolved on its own after a few weeks with some rest and stretching.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know about the ankle sprain and the previous sciatica. Good that the sciatica resolved on its own. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, arthritis, or any autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No diabetes, arthritis, or autoimmune conditions that I’m aware of. My family history is pretty unremarkable as well – no history of nerve problems or similar conditions. I have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and everything has always been within normal ranges. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. I have a copy of my medical records with me, if you’d like to review them.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear. That's reassuring. Private insurance is good to know, and thanks for offering your records, that’s helpful. Let me quickly access your EHR here… Okay, I see your recent check-ups are all normal, as you said. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed when you're ready. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Okay, reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. Is that alright? I can adjust the pressure if needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, grip strength is good. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton ball, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes for me, please. Okay, can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it now. Just there, on the top of my foot. And… now, on the outside of my calf. It feels… a little diminished here, on the inside of my shin, though. Not completely absent, but… less noticeable than the other areas.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful. Diminished sensation on the inside of your shin is a key finding. Now, one last thing. I’m going to ask you to stand and walk for me, both on your heels and on your toes. Just a few steps is fine.
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. Please let me know if anything feels unusual or if you notice any difficulty. I am mindful of trying to maintain a steady gait.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Gait appears normal, and I didn’t notice any instability. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings - the diminished sensation on the inside of your shin, along with the tingling and numbness - it sounds like you may have some mild nerve compression, possibly related to the work you do. It's hard to say definitively without further testing, but it could be something like peroneal nerve entrapment. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Peroneal nerve entrapment… I’ve never heard of that. Is that serious? And what kind of further testing are we talking about? I am also curious as to whether it’s something I can manage myself, or if I’ll require treatment of some sort. I am hoping it isn’t something that will require a prolonged recovery time, as my work schedule can be…demanding.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address those questions. Peroneal nerve entrapment means the peroneal nerve, which runs along the outside of your leg, is being compressed. It’s not usually serious, but it can cause weakness and numbness, like you're experiencing. As for testing, I'd like to order an electromyography and nerve conduction study . This will help us pinpoint exactly where the compression is happening and how severe it is. It's a painless test, though it can be a little uncomfortable. And regarding management, often, it can be managed conservatively with things like rest, stretching, proper footwear, and avoiding activities that aggravate the symptoms. We can discuss specific stretches and exercises. In some cases, physical therapy is helpful. We would start with conservative measures, and if those don’t improve your symptoms, we could consider other options, like a brace or, rarely, surgery. Given your demanding work schedule, we'll focus on getting you relief quickly and minimizing any disruption. We will start with the conservative management plan. Do you have any questions about the EMG/NCS or the conservative management plan?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s…reassuring to hear about the conservative management options. An EMG and NCS… I suppose I can tolerate a little discomfort for a definitive diagnosis. Could you tell me more about the specifics of those tests? What should I expect during the procedure, and how long will it take to get the results? Also, regarding the stretches… are there any I can begin now to potentially alleviate some of the symptoms? I am always willing to try and be proactive in my own care.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. During the EMG and NCS, a technician will place small electrodes on your skin along the affected leg. The NCS uses a mild electrical current to measure the speed of nerve signals. You might feel a tingling sensation, like a brief muscle twitch. The EMG involves inserting a small needle into a muscle to measure electrical activity. That can be a little uncomfortable, but it's usually brief. The whole procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. It usually takes a week or so to get the results back from the lab. And yes, absolutely, there are stretches you can start now. Try these: 1. Ankle Circles: Sit or lie down and rotate your ankle in both directions 10-15 times. 2. Toe Raises: Sit or stand and lift your toes off the ground while keeping your heels on the ground. Hold for a few seconds, then lower them. Repeat 10-15 times. 3. Calf Stretch: Stand facing a wall, place one foot slightly behind the other, and lean forward, keeping your back heel on the ground. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. 4. Towel Stretch: Sit on the floor with your legs extended. Loop a towel around your toes and gently pull back, keeping your leg straight. Hold for 30 seconds. Do these stretches a few times a day. If they worsen your symptoms, stop and let me know. I will also send you a handout with diagrams of these stretches. Would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the EMG/NCS and adjust the treatment plan if needed?
PATIENT: That is all very helpful. The stretches sound manageable, and I am happy to begin them immediately. A handout would be wonderful, thank you. Yes, please, let's schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Perhaps in two weeks? That would give ample time for the lab results to return. I appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly explain everything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Two weeks sounds perfect. Let me see… how about August 16th at 10:00 AM?
PATIENT: August 16th at 10:00 AM works perfectly. Thank you again for your time and expertise, Doctor Georgiou. I feel much more at ease knowing there’s a plan in place. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Remember to start those stretches, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day!
