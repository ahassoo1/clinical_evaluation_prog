DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s terribly inconvenient, really. I have patients waiting, you know. Very important little ones.
DOCTOR: Right. An assistant scheduled this appointment… and you’re experiencing some difficulty with your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, well, that’s what they said. It’s… vague. Everything just seems a bit… muffled and blurry. It came on rather suddenly, I believe. Though, truthfully, I’ve been rather preoccupied. A very demanding profession, surgery, you understand. I simply don’t have time to keep track of… these things.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re busy, Ms. Julie. Sudden changes in vision and hearing are concerning, even if vague. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. When you say “suddenly,” can you recall roughly when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dates… I’m dreadful with dates. Let me think… it was… after young Master Abernathy’s tonsillectomy, I believe. No, wait… before? Honestly, it all blurs together. Perhaps a week ago? Maybe two? It truly wasn’t a significant enough event to remember, you see. Such a trivial matter.
DOCTOR: Alright. Approximately a week or two ago. And has this been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. As constant as this dreadful headache I’ve had all morning. Though, I suspect that’s simply from the stress of it all. Honestly, Doctor, I have a full operating schedule this afternoon. If this is going to take long… Is it something serious? You can just tell me, you know. I haven’t time for drawn-out explanations.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Julie, it's difficult to say without a proper examination. A headache along with changes in vision and hearing does warrant investigation. It could be something minor, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Let's start with a quick check of your vision, and then I’ll listen to your ears. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination? Really, Doctor. I’m a surgeon, you know. I’ve had examinations. Is this strictly necessary? I assure you, my vision is perfectly adequate for my work. Very well. If you insist. But please be quick. I have little Timothy Finch scheduled for a cleft palate repair this afternoon, and that boy requires my full attention.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Julie. And yes, I understand the importance of your schedule. Let's begin. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather… elementary. Are you quite sure you’re a doctor? My nurses conduct more thorough assessments. There. I’m following it. Now can we be done?
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you read the letters on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. These letters are terribly small. And the lighting in here is dreadful. E… C… P… U… Is that a V? No, perhaps a B… Honestly, Doctor, this is preposterous. I’m perfectly capable of reading. It’s the chart that’s the problem, not my eyesight. There. I’ve humored you. Now, what next?
DOCTOR: Right. Your visual acuity is… diminished. We’ll need to document that. Now, let’s check your hearing. I'm going to place these headphones over your ears and play some tones. Please raise your hand when you hear a sound, even if it’s very faint. Alright?
PATIENT: Headphones? Must we? Honestly, Doctor, I have a very sensitive constitution. All this poking and prodding… It’s simply barbaric. But very well. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I have patients awaiting me. Hurry up. This is terribly uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you hear a tone in your right ear?
PATIENT: Hmm? A tone? Is that what that buzzing is? Honestly, Doctor, the ventilation system in here is atrocious. It’s probably just that. No, wait… perhaps a very faint… something. Is that what you’re referring to? It’s barely audible. I suppose. Though, I can’t guarantee it wasn’t simply the air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And in your left ear?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite tedious. It’s the same. A faint buzzing. Barely perceptible. I suspect my left ear is slightly better, but it’s difficult to say with all this… noise. Just get it over with. I’m growing increasingly impatient. Do you have a diagnosis yet? Or must I endure further… indignities?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, your hearing is diminished in both ears, and your vision is also reduced. Based on this brief examination, and given the headache you’re experiencing, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. It could be something as simple as age-related changes, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I'm going to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. I'll also refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test, and an ophthalmologist for a more detailed eye exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Absolutely not! That sounds… invasive. And an audiologist? An ophthalmologist? Doctor, are you suggesting I’m… failing? I am a perfectly capable surgeon! This is preposterous! Honestly, I think I’ve heard enough. I’ll consult with my personal physician. I have patients to see. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, frankly, it was a rather unproductive consultation.
