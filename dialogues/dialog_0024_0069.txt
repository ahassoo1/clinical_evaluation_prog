DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiо. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s about getting some vaccinations, if that’s okay. I think I’m due for a few, but I wasn’t entirely sure which ones.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I just want to make sure I’m all up to date. I haven’t really kept track lately, to be honest. I’m single, live alone, and sometimes things just...slip my mind. But I do have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Medicare…yes, that clarifies some things. Let’s not waste time. Do you have any records of previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: Records? Not really, no. I’ve moved around a bit over the years, and I don't think I ever kept a good list. I'm sorry about that. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A problem?
PATIENT: No, no, it's alright. I understand. I just… it makes things a bit harder, that’s all. Okay. Well, we can figure it out. Do you remember anything about vaccinations you've had? Like, maybe for tetanus, or flu? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mr. Paguiо, with all due respect, "anything at all" is not a particularly helpful answer. We are not conducting a guessing game here. Have you had a tetanus booster within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Sorry, Doctor. Ten years… hmm. Let me think. I had a bad cut maybe… seven years ago? At work, with some machinery. I think they gave me a shot then, but honestly, I was mostly focused on the bleeding. So, maybe? It was a while back. I really can’t be sure. I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: Seven years... insufficient. And work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, at the factory. I’m a Production, Planning, and Expediting Clerk, mostly making sure things run smoothly. It's not dangerous work usually, but accidents happen, you know? It was a small cut, nothing major, but they insisted on a shot. Would that have been tetanus? I suppose I just assumed so. It feels like a lifetime ago, honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Paguiо, we're establishing a baseline here. It's crucial. Let's move on. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't really had much in the way of medications over the years. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and nothing strong. No reactions or anything like that. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Though I'm starting to feel my age a bit now.
DOCTOR: “No known allergies… allegedly.” Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a day in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a month, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just work, a bit of television, and trying to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. Nothing serious, never been hospitalized for anything, no major illnesses. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing that required a doctor’s visit for more than a quick check-up. I try to eat well, get enough sleep… well, most of the time, anyway.
DOCTOR: So, no diabetes, no hypertension, no cardiac issues... Remarkable, for your age and build. And family history?
PATIENT: That's good to hear, right? As for family… my mother lived to be 85, but she had some trouble with her knees in the end. My father passed away younger, in his 60s, but it was… an accident, not really related to health. I don’t recall any major illnesses on either side of the family, honestly. Nothing genetic that I’m aware of. It wasn't something we talked about much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Wasn't something we talked about." A convenient omission. Very well. Let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm not very good with medical things, as you might have guessed.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but within acceptable parameters given your… stature. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is… suboptimal. Do you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain or shortness of breath. Never have. Sometimes I get a bit winded walking up the stairs, but I think that’s just getting older, you know? And maybe the weight. It's nothing serious, I don’t think. I just try not to overdo it. Is that blood pressure something to worry about?
DOCTOR: “Something to worry about” is a rather imprecise question, Mr. Paguiо. It requires…management. We'll need to monitor it. Now, let's assess your reflexes. Adequate, though somewhat sluggish. Now, I recommend we administer a tetanus booster, along with the influenza vaccine. And I strongly suggest a consultation with a cardiologist, given your blood pressure and build.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot. A cardiologist? Is that really necessary? I mean, I feel fine, mostly. But the booster and flu shot, yes, I’m happy to get those. That’s what I came for, remember? Perhaps we could focus on those for now? I don't want to get too worried about everything at once.
DOCTOR: "Too worried"?
PATIENT: No, no, I didn't mean it like that, Doctor. It's just... I get a bit anxious sometimes, especially with medical things. It's probably nothing, but I don't want to jump to conclusions. The booster and flu shot sound good. If everything checks out after those, we can talk about the cardiologist, maybe?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Paguiо. We will proceed with the tetanus booster and influenza vaccination. However, I must document your refusal of the cardiology consultation. I am providing you with the recommended course of action, and you are responsible for the potential consequences. Now, please roll up your sleeve.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I trust your judgement. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: There. It's done. Both administered. A slight discomfort is to be expected. I'm providing you with discharge instructions regarding potential side effects. You may experience mild fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. If symptoms worsen or persist for more than 48 hours, you are to seek immediate medical attention. Now, I shall schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to assess your response to the vaccinations. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm alright for now. Just…thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you getting those done. Hopefully, I won't feel too bad afterwards. And I'll… think about the cardiologist. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No. You may leave. And do try to prioritize your health, Mr. Paguiо. It's a finite resource. .
