DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Marialena. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’ve been experiencing a rather… persistent pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome. It’s the main reason for my visit.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent bladder pressure, that doesn’t sound very comfortable at all. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like a constant fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the restroom. It feels like there’s still quite a bit left, if that makes sense? And I find myself needing to go… more frequently than usual, especially at night. It’s been going on for about three weeks now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant fullness and frequent urination, particularly at night – that’s helpful. Three weeks is a good timeframe to know. When you say frequent, roughly how many times are you going to the bathroom in a typical day, and how many times at night?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… during the day, I’d say every two to three hours, perhaps. It varies a little, but it’s definitely more often than I used to. And at night… usually at least twice. Sometimes three times, which is… disruptive, naturally. I don’t recall ever having to get up that often before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly every two to three hours during the day and two to three times at night. And this is a recent change for you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely a recent change. It’s… quite a contrast to how things were before the last month or so. I haven’t altered my fluid intake significantly, I don’t believe. I drink about the same amount of water as I always have – maybe six to eight glasses a day. And no changes to my diet, either.
DOCTOR: Right, no changes to fluids or diet, that’s good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bladder pressure and frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual lately. It’s not debilitating, but I’ve definitely felt more sluggish. And… occasionally, a slight discomfort in my lower abdomen, but it’s very mild and comes and goes. It doesn't feel like a sharp pain, more like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and a mild, dull ache in your lower abdomen. And is there any pain when you are urinating?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain whatsoever when I urinate. It’s a smooth, normal stream, as far as I can tell. It’s just… the feeling afterwards, that lingering fullness, is what’s concerning me. And, as I said, the frequency. It’s quite a disruption to my day, and honestly, a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination, just the lingering fullness and frequency. That helps narrow things down. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, not that I've observed. The color seems normal, and there's no unusual odor, as far as I can tell. It looks the same as it always has. I haven't noticed any blood or anything like that, thankfully. I do try to pay attention to those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes to the appearance of your urine. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Not recently, no. I had a very mild cold back in April, but that cleared up quickly. Nothing since then. I generally stay quite healthy, if I may say so myself. I try to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise. I've been married for ten years, and thankfully, my husband hasn’t been ill either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries or medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, and I have a mild case of seasonal allergies. Other than that, nothing significant. I’ve always been quite fortunate with my health, generally. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a teenager and seasonal allergies. And you're covered by Medicare. That's helpful. One last question for now: what about family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history… my mother had diabetes, type 2, and she also suffered from high blood pressure. My father was generally healthy, though. No history of bladder issues or kidney problems on either side of the family, as far as I know. I do know my maternal grandmother had arthritis, but that's about it in terms of significant medical conditions.
DOCTOR: Alright, so diabetes and high blood pressure in your mother, and no known bladder or kidney problems in the family. Thank you for sharing all of that, Marialena. It gives me a good starting point. Just to confirm, your height is listed as 165 centimeters and your weight as 64 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. One hundred and sixty-five centimeters and sixty-four kilograms. You have a very good memory, Doctor. Or perhaps a very good system for recording information! Either way, it’s reassuring to know everything is being documented properly.
DOCTOR: Thank you. We strive to be thorough. Alright, based on what you've told me, and your medical history, there are a few possibilities we should consider. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, though the lack of pain makes that less likely. Another possibility is overactive bladder, or interstitial cystitis, though that usually presents with more pain. Given your mother’s history of diabetes, we should also rule out any blood sugar issues contributing to increased urination. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a blood glucose test to rule out diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: That sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Checking for infection and ruling out diabetes both seem prudent given the circumstances. Yes, I am perfectly agreeable to both a urine analysis and a blood glucose test. I trust your judgment. And I appreciate you explaining the reasoning behind the tests. It helps me feel more informed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, I'm ordering both tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a urine sample, and then we'll draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright with me. A physical exam and neurological check seem like appropriate next steps. I understand the importance of a thorough assessment. Please, proceed at your own pace. I am here to cooperate in any way I can. I do appreciate you explaining each step beforehand, Doctor. It alleviates any anxieties I might have.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marialena. That's very kind of you to say. It's important to me that you feel comfortable and informed. Alright, let's start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen for any unusual sounds. It might be a little cool against your skin, so let me know if you're uncomfortable. Your abdomen feels soft and there are no immediate signs of tenderness. Bowel sounds are normal. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m going to briefly check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs and relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am perfectly comfortable, thank you. I will relax my arms. Please proceed at your own pace. I trust your expertise. It's reassuring to be in such capable hands. And thank you again for explaining each step; it truly does help.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal and symmetrical on both sides. Everything seems within the normal range. Alright, that concludes the physical exam. Everything appears normal at this point, which is good. We'll need to wait for the lab results to get a clearer picture. The nurse should be in shortly to collect the urine sample. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Marialena?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe I do at this moment. You have answered all of my concerns thoroughly and have explained each step of the process with commendable clarity. I feel quite reassured by your assessment, and I am confident in your ability to diagnose the issue. I will simply wait for the results of the tests now. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. The nurse will let us know as soon as the results are available, and we'll discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, back pain, or blood in your urine – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. We'll get to the bottom of this. Feel free to relax while you wait.
PATIENT: .
