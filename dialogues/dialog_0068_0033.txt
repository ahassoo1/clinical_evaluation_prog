DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… rather inconvenient, truthfully. I seem to be losing my senses. My vision is quite blurred, and things are… muffled. It happened rather suddenly, you see. I haven’t got time for this, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Losing your senses… both vision and hearing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what I said. It's terribly frustrating. I have important engagements, you know. I don't recall when exactly it started, but it's quite recent. Honestly, I don't understand why these things happen to me.
DOCTOR: Recent onset… both senses affected. Hmm. Okay. And is this… sudden loss complete, or is it gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Complete… no, not complete. More… fading. Like looking through a dirty window, and the volume on a radio being turned down, slowly. It’s… difficult to explain if you haven’t experienced it. Are you quite finished with the questions?
DOCTOR: Fading… okay. And has anything specific triggered this fading, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Triggered? Doctor, really. One doesn’t simply have a “trigger” for losing one’s senses. It happens. I haven’t been… hit on the head, if that’s what you're implying. I lead a perfectly normal life, or did, before this unfortunate… incident. I simply woke up and things weren’t as clear, or as loud. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: No head trauma… alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this – dizziness, headache, any ringing in your ears, or perhaps any weakness or numbness anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re just listing things. I am not a medical professional, Doctor. How am I supposed to know what to look for? Perhaps a slight… headache, now that you mention it. But I get headaches. Everyone gets headaches! And no, I haven’t been feeling “weak” or… numb. Really, it’s just the vision and hearing. Honestly, I find this entire process rather… tedious. Are we nearing a conclusion?
DOCTOR: Alright. Slight headache… no weakness or numbness. Okay. Now, Ms. Julie, do you have any past medical problems—anything you’ve been treated for before?
PATIENT: Doctor, I assure you, my health records are quite extensive. I’ve always taken excellent care of myself. A touch of arthritis in my hands, perhaps, but nothing of consequence. And a hysterectomy, many years ago, but that’s hardly relevant to… this. I’ve seen the best doctors, always. I expect this will be a simple matter to resolve. Do try to be efficient.
DOCTOR: Arthritis… hysterectomy. Any family history of anything like this—hearing or vision loss, perhaps?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness, Doctor, I barely remember my family, let alone their medical ailments. My mother had… something. A touch of high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… well, he was a difficult man. Honestly, I doubt his health records would be of any use to you. Are we still on this? It’s really quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history, as far as you recall. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Just the usual. A little something for the arthritis, a vitamin D supplement… and, let me see… a small dose of something for my nerves. My ex-husband was… exceptionally trying. Honestly, I can’t recall the names. It’s all quite unimportant, really. I doubt they’re contributing to this… inconvenience. I’d like to be finished soon, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll try to be quick. Before we proceed, Ms. Julie, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I'm a perfectly healthy woman. I don’t have time for allergies. Perhaps a slight reaction to a certain brand of perfume once, but that’s hardly relevant. Honestly, I find these questions rather… insulting. Are we nearing a diagnosis? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Julie, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to check your ears, your eyes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? After all these… trivial questions? I suppose I haven’t a choice, have I? But please, be quick. I have a very busy schedule. And don't touch my hair. It's just been done.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your ears. …Alright. The ear canals appear clear, but there’s a slight… dullness to the tympanic membrane. Not significant, but worth noting. …Pupils are reactive to light, but the fundi appear a little…pale. And your extraocular movements are normal. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. …Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Dullness? Pale? Doctor, you're not making any sense. I came here for a simple explanation, not a vague assessment. Are you going to tell me what's wrong with me, or are we just going to continue this… charade? I really must be going. This is quite a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration. Based on the exam and your history, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing this. The findings are subtle, but the dullness in your tympanic membranes and pale fundi, combined with the fading of your senses, suggest… possible decreased blood flow to the inner ear and optic nerve. It could be several things—a vascular issue, a neurological condition, or even a side effect of a medication. To be certain, I’d like to order a few tests—a complete blood count, a CT scan of your head, and an MRI to evaluate your brain and optic nerves. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? An MRI? Doctor, are you quite serious? I am not a medical specimen! I am a respectable woman with engagements! I refuse to be subjected to such… invasive procedures. I came here expecting a simple diagnosis, perhaps a pill or two, and now you’re talking about scans and… and brains? Absolutely not! I think I’ll seek a second opinion. A competent second opinion. I’m leaving now. Don’t bother calling me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Julie. I understand your concerns. However, without further investigation, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out more serious conditions. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms—dizziness, weakness, or severe headache—please seek immediate medical attention. Here is my card. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you change your mind. .
