DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, it’s this trouble I’ve been having. With… going to the bathroom. It keeps happening again and again. It’s very… bothersome. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while. I just want it to stop, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating to deal with something like that for a while. “Again and again” – can you tell me more about what’s happening when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it burns, mostly. When I… you know. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just went. It’s… uncomfortable. I don’t know what else to tell you. It's just… a bad feeling. I'm sorry I'm not very clear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Claudene. You're doing fine. Burning is a good detail to know. And feeling like you need to go constantly, even after you’ve just been… that’s important too. Just to clarify, is it painful during urination, or is it more of a burning sensation afterward?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Hmm. I think… both? It starts during, a little bit, and then it lingers afterward. It’s… hard to say exactly when it changes. It just… hurts the whole time, really. And it makes me very… anxious. I don’t like feeling like I have to rush all the time. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning both during and after urination, and it’s causing you some anxiety – I appreciate you telling me that. Anxiety can definitely make things worse. And no, it’s not necessarily “normal” to experience that, but it’s certainly something we need to investigate. Now, let's try to get a bit more information. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… in the urine? Oh, goodness. Let me think. It looks… normal, I think. Yellow, like it should. Maybe a little darker sometimes? I don’t really pay much attention, to be honest. I don't recall seeing any blood, if that’s what you mean. I just want this to be over with, if you don't mind. This is a bit… unpleasant to talk about.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Claudene, and I’ll try to make this as quick and comfortable as possible. No blood is good to know. A little darker sometimes could be related to dehydration, but we'll look into that. Now, have you had a fever, or any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I've noticed. I haven’t taken my temperature. And pain… well, my back always aches a little, you know, getting older. But not… a sharp pain. Just the usual old age discomfort. I’m not sure if that’s what you mean. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just tired. This whole thing is… draining. I've been drinking plenty of water, though, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever and just your usual back aches – that's helpful. You're drinking plenty of water, that's good. Now, just a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh dear. Well… they’re… regular, I suppose. Not particularly… different. I don’t… I don’t usually think about such things. Is this important? I really don't understand why you're asking about all of this. It’s just my bladder, isn’t it? I’d like to get this sorted, if possible, and go home. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Claudene, and I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. It's just that sometimes things are connected, and I want to be thorough. I promise we're getting closer to figuring this out. Okay, let’s focus on your bladder then. Now, have you noticed any leakage, or difficulty starting to urinate?
PATIENT: Leakage… no, not really. Sometimes a little dribble at the very end, but that's just… old age again, I expect. And starting… hmm. It takes a moment, sometimes. I have to… push a little. Not a lot, but it’s not instantaneous, if that makes sense. I just… wait a bit, and it starts. I’m so sorry I’m not being very helpful. It's just… a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Claudene. It’s perfectly alright to not remember everything, and you’re giving me a lot of good information. Okay, so no significant leakage, and sometimes a little difficulty starting. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll just listen to your abdomen, and gently examine your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Well… I suppose so. If it has to be done. But please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… quickly, if you could. I really would like to get home. I have a little garden I need to tend to, you see. The tomatoes are ripening.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I will be very gentle, and we’ll make this as quick as possible. I promise. Okay, if you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then gently press on your lower abdomen to check for tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little tender, yes. Right there. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. It feels… a bit bruised, almost. But I haven’t bumped it or anything. It’s just… a dull ache. And please, be careful. It’s… delicate.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about here?
PATIENT: That side… feels a little better, actually. Still a little sensitive, but not as much. Just… a general discomfort. It’s hard to explain. It's not a sharp pain, just… a feeling of pressure. And… honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious again. This is… unsettling. I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. I understand your anxiety, and I’m sorry for making you uncomfortable. Based on what you’ve told me, and the tenderness I felt during the exam, it sounds like you may have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. It's very common, especially in women, and usually easily treated. To be sure, I'd like to order a urine sample for a lab test. That will confirm if there’s an infection and what type of bacteria is causing it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A test… yes, alright. If that’s what you think is best. A urine sample. I can do that, I suppose. Where… where do I go? And how… how do I do it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at these things anymore. Everything is… complicated. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Don't worry, Claudene, it's very straightforward. There's a restroom just down the hall. I'll give you a sterile cup and a set of instructions. You’ll need to clean the area thoroughly before collecting a small sample of your urine. The nurse will be happy to help you if you need it. It’s very common to need a little assistance. Once we have the results, we can start treatment. Usually, that involves a course of antibiotics. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, alright. If that’s what will help. I don’t really know much about medicine, you see. I just trust your judgment, Doctor. A nurse will help me with the sample? That’s… reassuring. I’m not very steady on my feet anymore. Oh, and… will it hurt? Taking the medicine, I mean. I don’t need any more discomfort, if you don’t mind. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will absolutely help you. She's very kind and patient. And no, antibiotics usually don't cause pain. Sometimes they can cause a little upset stomach, but we can give you something to help with that if needed. I'm going to go ahead and have the nurse come in and help you with the urine sample. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of action and get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with me. I’m not very good at explaining things, and I forget so easily. Just… please hurry, if you could. I really would like to get home to my tomatoes. And thank you again. .
