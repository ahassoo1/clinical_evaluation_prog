DOCTOR: Good morning, Venus. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My blood pressure has been… difficult. And lately, I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But it worries me. I do not like not remembering.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly concerning when things feel… off. “Difficult” blood pressure and some memory concerns. Okay. Let’s start with the blood pressure. When you say difficult, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It goes up. Very high, sometimes. Even with the pills the doctor gave me… before. It is… unpredictable. I check it myself, at home, and it can be… quite alarming. And it feels… bad. A headache, mostly. A heavy feeling. I do not know what the numbers are, exactly. Just that they are not good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it goes up despite medication, you get headaches and a heavy feeling. And you monitor it at home, but don’t have the specific numbers. That’s good you’re checking it, though. Do you recall what the previous doctor told you the target blood pressure should be?
PATIENT: Target? No… I do not remember a target. He just gave me the pills and said to take them. I… I was very upset then. My husband had… passed away, not long before. I was not thinking very clearly about numbers, I think. Just… taking the pills. Is that bad? Should I have remembered a number?
DOCTOR: No, Venus, it’s absolutely not bad. Losing someone is… profoundly difficult. It's perfectly understandable you wouldn’t remember specifics then. Let me take a look at your records… Ah, here we are. It looks like Dr. Petrov prescribed Lisinopril a little over a year ago. He did note a goal of under 140/90. Do you still have those pills?
PATIENT: Yes. I have them. In the kitchen. I… I take them, most days. Sometimes I forget. Or… I think I took them, and then I am not sure. It is the forgetting that is so… frightening. And lately, it is worse. I used to be very good with dates, with names. Now… not so much. It worries me that it is… something serious. Like my mother. She… she had problems remembering, near the end.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your mother's experience. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. So, you’ve been taking the Lisinopril, but not consistently due to some memory lapses. And the memory issues seem to be getting worse recently. To get a better understanding of everything, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My medical history… Well, before my husband… I was very healthy. Very active. I used to swim, every day. Then, after… I did not care for myself as much. I gained some weight. My doctor, Dr. Petrov, he told me my cholesterol was a little high. He gave me a pill for that, too. But I stopped taking it. It made me feel… strange. And, as I said, my blood pressure. It was fine, before. And now… it is this. And the forgetting. Is it the blood pressure, do you think? Could that be causing this?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Venus. High blood pressure can sometimes contribute to memory problems, but there are many other possibilities. We’ll need to investigate further. You mentioned swimming, which is wonderful. How long ago did you stop?
PATIENT: Oh… it must be… five years, now? Maybe six. After my husband… I just lost interest in everything. I stayed inside. I did not see my friends. I did not eat properly. I… I regret it, now. I should have taken better care of myself. It is easy to let things go, when you are sad. But now… this forgetting. It is a very unpleasant feeling. And I worry about… well, about becoming like my mother.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel that way, Venus. Grief is incredibly difficult, and it’s common to neglect self-care during such times. Losing interest in things and experiencing changes in habits is a natural part of the process. Okay. Let’s talk about your family history. Were there any other medical conditions that ran in your family, besides your mother’s memory issues?
PATIENT: Yes… my father, he had… heart problems. A very bad heart. He died when he was… sixty, I think. And my sister, she has… diabetes. She takes pills for it, every day. And her hands… they tremble. She cannot hold a cup of tea very well. Is that important? Do you need to know about my sister's hands? I just… I want to tell you everything, so you can help me. I am very worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Venus, that's all very important information. Heart problems in your father and diabetes with tremors in your sister… These details help us build a more complete picture. Do you know what type of diabetes your sister has?
PATIENT: I… I do not know the type. She just says she has diabetes. She has had it for many years. She goes to a different doctor, in… New Jersey. I have not seen her in a long time. She is… very busy. I just know she takes pills, and her hands shake. And she gets very tired, easily. Is… is that all you need to know about my family? I am sorry I cannot be more helpful. It is… it is difficult to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Venus. Don't apologize. It’s perfectly normal to not remember everything. Okay. Let's move onto your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband… he smoked, for many years. But I always told him it was bad for him. He tried to quit, many times. He finally stopped, just before… well. I do not like smoking. It smells unpleasant. And I do not drink, either. Just tea. Sometimes, a little bit of vodka, for special occasions. But not often. I prefer tea. It is… calming.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol. That’s good. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I have never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything. I used to love cooking, before. I made everything from scratch. Cakes, pies… everything. But now… I do not have much appetite. I eat just enough to… to stay alive, I suppose. It is… it is not very interesting anymore. I miss my husband's cooking, too. He made the best borscht.
DOCTOR: I see. No known allergies. Okay, Venus. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned taking Lisinopril for blood pressure, but not always consistently. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. The Lisinopril. And… sometimes, I take a pill for my cholesterol. When I remember. It is called… Atorvastatin, I think. And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, in the winter. But I ran out a long time ago. I do not think it made much difference. And… sometimes, I take a sleeping pill, if I cannot sleep. But only very rarely. It makes me feel… strange, the next day. So I try not to take it. Is that everything? I am afraid I am forgetting something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, occasional Atorvastatin, and a sleeping pill when needed. It sounds like you've been managing these on your own for quite a while. That's a lot of information, Venus, thank you for sharing it with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and memory. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what is happening. The forgetting… it is very frightening. I will cooperate with anything you need. Just… be quick, if you could? I have… appointments later this afternoon. And I do not want to be late. But… do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venus. I will do my best to be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the table. Your blood pressure is 160/95. That is elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal. Balance is good. And… could you tell me the year right now?
PATIENT: The year?… Oh dear. Let me think… Is it… 2024? No… Wait… Is it 2023? No… I… I am sorry. I just… I cannot remember the year. I know it is close to now, but… I am very confused. It is embarrassing. I used to be so good with dates. So good with everything. But now… everything is… blurry. Like a dream. Is that bad, Doctor? Is it very bad?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Venus. It’s perfectly okay. It's helpful for me to know this. It sounds like we do need to investigate this memory concern further. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your elevated blood pressure could be contributing to the memory issues, but the fact that it’s poorly controlled, combined with the changes you’re describing, warrants further investigation. I want to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a brain scan, likely an MRI, to get a better look at your brain and rule out any structural problems. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A brain scan…? Oh dear. That sounds… frightening. But… if you think it is necessary, then yes. Yes, I suppose. I just… I do not like hospitals. They remind me… of my husband. He… he was in the hospital, for a long time. But… if it will help, then yes. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please be quick. And… explain everything to me, before you do it. I do not want any surprises. And… is it very expensive? I do not have much money, you see. My husband… he took care of everything. But now… it is just me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venus. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a brain scan. We will do everything we can to make you comfortable. The MRI is a non-invasive procedure. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't hurt, but it can be a little noisy, so we'll provide you with earplugs. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the cost, I understand your concerns about money. We'll work with the hospital’s financial assistance department to see if you qualify for any discounts or payment plans. And we'll prioritize the most essential tests first. I will also see if there are any community resources available to help cover the costs. Before we proceed, I want to recommend a consultation with a neurologist – a doctor who specializes in brain and nerve disorders. They can help us interpret the scan results and determine the best course of treatment. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? Another doctor…? Oh dear. It is all so… overwhelming. But… if you think it is best, then yes. Yes, I suppose. I just… I do not want to keep going to different doctors, endlessly. But if it will help me understand what is happening… then yes. I will do whatever you think is best, Doctor. But… please, explain everything to me, very carefully. I do not want to be confused. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have appointments, you see. And… I just want to know what is happening, as soon as possible. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Venus, that’s not too much to ask at all. I completely understand. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything very carefully. We'll schedule an appointment with a neurologist as soon as possible – likely within the next week or two. The MRI results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we’ll review them together and discuss the findings. The neurologist will then provide a more detailed assessment and recommend a treatment plan. In the meantime, it’s important to continue taking your Lisinopril as consistently as possible, even if you’ve been forgetting. And I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication to help with your memory. It’s called Donepezil. It’s often used in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but it can also be helpful for other types of memory problems. It may have some side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea, so we’ll start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I’ll also give you a list of resources for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia support groups. It can be helpful to connect with other people who are going through similar experiences. And I want you to know that I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now, Venus?
PATIENT: Donepezil… another pill…? Oh dear. It is all so… much. But… if you think it will help, then yes. I will try it. But… what if it makes me feel worse? What if the side effects are terrible? And… what if it doesn't work at all? I am afraid, Doctor. I am very afraid. And… I do not want to be a burden. I do not want to be… like my mother. No… I do not think I have any questions right now. Just… please, be quick. And… explain everything to me, very carefully. I do not want to be confused. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for trying to help me. But… I am still very afraid. Is it… is it possible that it is something serious?
DOCTOR: Venus, it’s perfectly understandable to feel afraid. It’s okay to be scared when facing the unknown. Let’s address your concerns one at a time. Donepezil, like any medication, does have potential side effects. But most people tolerate it well, and the side effects are usually mild. We'll start with a low dose, as I mentioned, and monitor you closely. If you experience any bothersome side effects, we can always adjust the dose or stop the medication altogether. As for whether it will work, that’s something we’ll have to see. It doesn’t work for everyone, but it can be very helpful for some people. We'll assess your response to the medication over time and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. And as for whether it’s something serious… we don’t know yet. That’s why we need to do these tests – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. But it’s important to remember that memory problems can have many causes, and not all of them are serious. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or a side effect of medication. We’ll rule out all the possibilities and develop a plan to address your specific needs. Please don’t feel like you’re a burden. You’re not a burden. You’re a patient who is seeking help, and I’m here to provide that help. And remember, you’re not alone. We’ll face this together, one step at a time. I have scheduled you for the MRI next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. I have also made a referral to Dr. Anya Volkov, a neurologist, and her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. We will talk again after you see Dr. Volkov, and review the MRI results together. Do you have any questions about any of that before we finish for today?
PATIENT: Tuesday… 9:00 AM… Dr. Volkov… No… I do not think so. I think… I think I need to go home and rest. It is all so… overwhelming. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for everything. You have been very kind. But… I am still very afraid. I… I hope it is not… too late.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venus. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Don't worry, it's not too late. We are taking all the right steps. Please, don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Take care, Venus. And please, try to rest.
