DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Percell, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, Percell. Just Percell is fine. Thanks for seeing me, Doctor... Ruocco, right? I remember you showing me to the room earlier. Good to meet ya properly now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ruocco. Don’t bother with formalities. Now, let’s get this over with. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, feels like… a tight band, almost. It’s been happening on and off for a couple weeks now. Not terrible pain, more of a… nagging thing, ya know? It just won't go away completely.
DOCTOR: A headache, right. Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yep, a couple weeks now. Maybe three? It’s hard to keep track, honestly. It's not constant, like I said. Some days it's barely there, other days it's enough to make me a little grumpy. Doesn't keep me from doing things, but it's… present. I find myself rubbing the back of my head a lot. It's right at the base of my skull, kinda where your neck meets your head.
DOCTOR: Grumpy, huh?
PATIENT: Heh, yeah, a little grumpy. My daughter jokes I'm always grumpy, but this makes it worse. It's not a throbbing headache, not like the ones my wife used to get. More… pressure. Like someone’s tightening a belt around my head. Does that make sense? I try to ignore it, but it’s hard when you’re trying to focus, you know? I do a lot of numbers for folks, gotta keep a clear head for that.
DOCTOR: Numbers?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’m a financial advisor. Help people plan for retirement, save for their kids’ college… that kinda thing. It’s good work, but it requires a lot of concentration. And this headache… well, it makes it harder to stay focused. Sometimes I even get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, though I’m not sure if that's related. I used to be pretty sharp with the figures, but lately… I just feel a little… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any fevers, chills, nausea?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Definitely no nausea. Haven’t thrown up or anything like that. And my appetite’s been normal, I think. Still enjoy my food, thankfully! My daughter makes a mean papaya salad, I wouldn't miss that for a headache. I have been a little more tired than usual, maybe, but I’m 84, Doc. Being tired kinda comes with the territory, ya know? It’s not like I'm dragging myself around, just… a little more easily worn out.
DOCTOR: Of course. Tired. Eighty-four. Alright. Any family history of… anything?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My wife, she had high blood pressure, and her mother too. I think my father had some trouble with his memory towards the end, but I don't know if it was anything serious. Just… old age, mostly. We didn’t talk about those things much back then. Not like people do now. No one in the family that I know of ever had bad headaches, though. Just the regular ones, ya know? The kind everyone gets when they're stressed or tired. Not this nagging thing I’ve got.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, not regularly. I used to take something for my knees, years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. Didn’t seem to be doing much good anyway. And allergies… not that I know of. Never had any trouble with pollen or food or anything like that. I eat pretty much everything, honestly. My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's a different story. So, no allergies, no medications. Just this headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Can you sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Used to have better posture, but it ain't what it used to be. Go ahead, Doc. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Some tenderness here. Not significant. Blood pressure is… acceptable, for your age. Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear. Neurological exam is… within normal limits, though your reflexes are a little slow. Overall, not particularly alarming. Probably just tension headache. Old age. Stress. We can try some over-the-counter pain relief. Ibuprofen. Naproxen. Don't exceed the recommended dosage.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Tension headache, huh? I guess that makes sense. I have been worrying about the market lately, things are kinda shaky. Ibuprofen, you say? I think I've got some of that at home, somewhere. Don't exceed the dosage… right, good advice. My daughter always tells me the same thing. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… exercises or anything? Or should I try to cut back on stress? Easier said than done, ya know.
DOCTOR: Cut back on stress, yes. Stay hydrated. Get some rest. If it doesn't improve in a week or gets significantly worse, see your primary care physician. Or come back here. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That's all I was really worried about, honestly. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. I'll try the ibuprofen and… try to relax. Though I can’t promise much on that last part. I’ll be seeing you around, I guess. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Don’t hesitate to come back if it doesn’t improve. Next patient. .
PATIENT: .
