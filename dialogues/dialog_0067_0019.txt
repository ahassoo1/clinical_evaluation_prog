DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me? My wife… she wants… a baby, maybe? We talk about it. Old now, both of us. She thinks maybe we can… plan? I don’t… I don’t know all the things. It’s a good thing, I think. A baby would be… nice. But I forget so much these days.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you and your wife are considering this. It is a big decision, and it’s perfectly normal to have questions, especially as you mentioned, with things being on your mind. So, you're here today to discuss the possibility of starting a family, even though you both are a bit older. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. Fair. Old… we are old. But happy. And we… we want to be careful. Make sure… everything is okay. She worries a lot. I try not to. But she… she wants to talk to someone. A doctor. That is why we come here, yes? To make sure it is… safe for baby, and for her. She is the one who… carries. I just… make things. Little models. Metal and plastic. Not babies.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s very thoughtful of both of you to come in and discuss this with me, and it’s wonderful that you’re thinking about your wife’s health and a safe pregnancy. We’ll absolutely explore all the factors to make sure this is as safe as possible. First, let’s talk a little bit about your wife’s overall health. Do you mind if I ask about her medical history?
PATIENT: No, no problem. She… she goes to the doctor. Regular. But… I don’t always go with her. She tells me… mostly okay. A little trouble with her knees, sometimes. Old age, she says. And… she had a problem, long time ago. With her stomach. They cut her open. But that was… many years ago. She says it doesn’t bother her now. She takes pills… for her blood pressure. I think. Small white pills. She’s good about taking her pills. Very good. Does that help? Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is very helpful, thank you. So, she sees a doctor regularly, some knee trouble, a previous abdominal surgery many years ago, and she takes medication for high blood pressure. You said “small white pills” – do you happen to know the name of the medication, or perhaps have a bottle we could look at?
PATIENT: Hmm… the name? No, I don’t think so. She keeps them in the kitchen. In a little box. With other things. I don’t… I don’t pay attention to that. She handles all the pills. I just… I know she takes them every morning. With her breakfast. She likes tea. And toast. But… maybe we can find the box? When we come back next time? She is very organized. She knows everything about her medicines. I am… not so good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s good that she’s so organized and takes her medication regularly. We can certainly look at the bottle next time. Knowing the name of the medication will help me understand her overall health picture a little better. Now, let's talk a little bit about you. Have you seen a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Me? Hmm… not so much. I used to, when I was working. But… retired now. Mostly okay. I stay busy. Making things. Little cars, little airplanes. Keeps my hands busy, keeps my mind busy. But… I had a little trouble with my heart, a long time ago. They put a… a little thing in me. A wire. They said it would help. It does. Mostly. No problems now. But… it’s been a long time. I don’t see the doctor much. Medicare… takes care of it, I think. My wife handles all the paperwork. She’s very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had some heart trouble in the past and have an implanted device. That’s good to know. And you said it’s been a long time since you’ve seen a doctor about it?
PATIENT: Yes, a long time. Many years. I feel okay. Mostly. Sometimes a little tired, but… old age, you know? I don’t… I don’t want to bother the doctor unless something is wrong. She says I worry too much. My wife. She says I’m fine. I trust her. But… maybe it’s good to check. Just to be sure. For the baby. If she gets… pregnant. It is good to be careful, yes?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Mr. Carlotta. It is good to be careful, and it’s very responsible of you to consider getting checked out, especially with the possibility of starting a family. It's important to know your baseline health to ensure everything goes smoothly. Let's talk about allergies. Do you or your wife have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I eat everything. My wife… she doesn’t like shellfish. Makes her… itchy. But that’s it. No medicines… I don’t remember any problems with medicines. Maybe… maybe when I was a little boy, I was allergic to something. But I don’t remember what. Long time ago. My wife… she might know. She remembers everything. She’s very good. No, I don’t think we have any serious allergies. Just the shellfish for her.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just the shellfish allergy for your wife. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for you. My wife… she used to, a long time ago. But she stopped. Many years ago. Alcohol… sometimes. A little wine with dinner. On special occasions. Not every day. Just… sometimes. And… drugs? No. Never. Bad things. We don’t… we don’t do those things. We are old. We like tea. And making things. Quiet life.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, just occasional wine with dinner. Now, before we move on, is there anything else at all you think I should know about your health or your wife’s health?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife… she worries a lot. About everything. She’s a good woman. Very strong. But she gets… anxious. Sometimes she can’t sleep. She takes something for that, sometimes. A small pill. Blue, I think. And… she’s been a little sad lately. Thinking about getting older. We both are. It’s… hard sometimes. But we have each other. Is that important? Should I tell you that?
DOCTOR: That is very important, Mr. Carlotta. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s helpful to know about her anxiety and sadness. It’s completely normal to feel that way as we get older, and it’s good she’s addressing it. We can certainly talk about ways to support her mental and emotional well-being. Now, I think we’ve covered a good amount of background information. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your general condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. A check-up. Okay. I trust you, Doctor. I am… a little tired, but… it’s okay. You check my heart. Make sure it’s still working. And my lungs. I used to work with metal. Sometimes… dusty. But… I feel okay. Mostly. Just a little tired. You check, Doctor. That’s good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax, and I’ll take it from here. First, let’s check your blood pressure. … 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and some potential anxiety. Now, let's listen to your heart. … Heart sounds are a little muffled, but regular rhythm. I can hear a slight murmur, which we'll want to keep an eye on. It sounds like an age-related change, but it’s good to document. And now, let’s listen to your lungs. … Breathing sounds are clear, with some mild diminished airflow in the lower lobes, consistent with your history of working with metal. No wheezing or crackles noted. Overall, your general condition seems stable, though we’ll want to investigate the elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur further. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. Sometimes a little tired, but… that’s just old age, I think. No chest pain. And… no swelling. My ankles are… okay. I wear socks, always. My wife says I need to wear socks. She worries about my feet. No swelling, Doctor. Mostly okay. Just… a little tired. And… I forget things. But that’s nothing new. What about my wife? Should she come in? For a check-up? She’s the one who… wants the baby.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And yes, it would be very beneficial for your wife to come in for a check-up as well. As you mentioned, she’s the one who would be carrying the baby, so it’s important to assess her overall health and discuss any potential risks or concerns. We can schedule an appointment for her right after this, if you’d like. Now, given your history and the slight elevation in your blood pressure, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us get a better understanding of your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and overall health. We’ll also do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm more closely. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is good. Blood tests… EKG… Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For the baby. And for my wife. She worries so much. Just… do what you need to do. And… when can she come in? For her check-up? She’s been… a little anxious, waiting for this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I understand completely. We can schedule your wife for a check-up tomorrow afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for her?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Yes, yes, that is good. 2:00 PM is fine. She will be happy. Very happy. She likes to plan things. She will write it down. In her little notebook. She’s very organized. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And… when will we get the results of my tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m glad we could get something scheduled for your wife. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. My nurse will call you both with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant changes in your condition, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You answered everything. Thank you, Doctor. You are very good. And… thank you for being patient with me. I forget things, you know. But you were very kind. And… tell your nurse… thank her too. She was very nice. I just want my wife to be happy. And… a baby would be nice. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was my pleasure meeting you. And I will certainly pass along your kind words to my nurse. We’ll do everything we can to help you and your wife achieve your goal. I wish you both all the best, and we’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00 PM for your wife’s appointment. .
