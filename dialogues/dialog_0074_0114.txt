DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Reisig. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. I have trouble when I lie flat. It feels like… like something is pressing on me. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I think. Not every night, but enough to bother me. I’d like to get it sorted, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. That sounds quite uncomfortable. Difficulty breathing when lying flat is something we want to investigate. So it's been happening for a few weeks, and not every night, you said. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s usually… after I’ve been eating, I believe. Not right away, though. Maybe an hour or two after dinner. And it seems worse if I’ve had a bigger meal. Though, truth be told, I don't always remember exactly when. I do try to eat a light supper, but… well, sometimes a little treat is nice. Does that make sense? It's not a constant thing, and I don’t keep a log, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's helpful to know it seems to correlate with eating, especially larger meals. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t keep a log – we’ll do our best to piece things together. You mentioned it feels like something is pressing on you. Can you describe that sensation a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a pain, exactly. It’s more… a heaviness. Right here, in the chest. Like something is sitting on me. And it makes it hard to get a good breath. Not like I’m choking, but… shallow, I suppose. I have to sit up to feel better. And then it goes away. It doesn’t happen when I’m sitting or standing. Just lying down. Is that clear enough? I hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Vanderwiele, you're explaining everything very clearly. A heaviness in the chest that’s relieved by sitting up is certainly something we need to explore. To get a better understanding, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, asthma, or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Let me see… Acid reflux, you say? I do sometimes get a bit of heartburn, yes. Nothing terrible, just… a burning feeling after a meal. I take those little antacids sometimes. Other than that… no, I don't think so. I had a touch of pneumonia when I was young, but that was a very long time ago. The doctor said I was fine after that. I had my gallbladder out many years back, but that was all straightforward. Otherwise, I've been reasonably healthy, all things considered. I've always been careful about what I eat, you know. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Vanderwiele. The history of heartburn and occasional antacid use is relevant, certainly. And it’s helpful to know about the pneumonia and gallbladder removal. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little blood pressure medicine, but that’s all. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And, like I said, those antacids when I need them. Nothing else. I've always been quite lucky, never been one for allergies.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some sort of heart trouble when he was older. He didn't take very good care of himself, always smoked. But I don't know the details. It was a long time ago. And my brother… he’s still living, thankfully. He’s healthy as a horse, as far as I know. He lives out in California, so I don’t see him often. I don't really have much information about their medical history, to be honest. Is that alright? I didn’t pay much attention to those sorts of things growing up.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. We work with the information we have. Knowing about your mother's high blood pressure and your father’s heart trouble is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were dreadful for your health, and she was right. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, a small glass. Nothing more. And I try to walk a little bit every day, when the weather is nice. It's hard sometimes, with the arthritis in my knees, but I manage. I used to be very active, but… well, age takes its toll, you know. I'm not as spry as I once was.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Vanderwiele. It’s good to hear you are mindful of your health and stay active when you can. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I don't mind the exam at all. Just… please be gentle with my knees, if you have to bend them. They do ache a little bit, you know. But other than that, go right ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a slight murmur, which is not uncommon, especially with age. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm listening to your lungs. Your breathing sounds clear, but a little diminished at the bases. Now, could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There. Is that alright? It feels a little tight in my chest sometimes, when I take a deep breath. Not painful, just… a little constricted. Like something is… I don’t know… holding it back. It's probably just my age, though. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know. I worry too much, I suppose. Is everything alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. I do hear a little wheezing on exhale, and your breath sounds are a bit diminished, as I mentioned. That, combined with the feeling of constriction you describe and the difficulty breathing when lying flat, suggests there may be some mild airway narrowing. It could be related to several things, including mild asthma, acid reflux irritating the airways, or even just age-related changes in the lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It will help us rule out any other possible causes and give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that’s fine. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I always try to do what the doctor tells me. I just… I hope it’s not anything serious. I don't want to be a bother to anyone. I’ve always been reasonably healthy, as I said. But I do appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ve been a little worried about this breathing for a while now. Where would I go to get this X-ray done? And will you tell me the results?
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Vanderwiele. It's my job to help you figure this out, and we're taking all the right steps. You can get the X-ray done at the imaging center across the street – they're very good there. I’ll send the order electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. The address is 123 Main Street, and their number is 555-1212, just in case. And yes, absolutely, I will review the results with you as soon as they come in. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, likely next week. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend continuing to take those antacids as needed, and try to elevate your head and shoulders when you lie down – perhaps with an extra pillow or two. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Elevate my head… yes, I've read that somewhere before. And the antacids, of course. I will do that. 123 Main Street, you said? I’ll have to write that down. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I suppose… there isn’t anything else I need to do right now? Just get the X-ray done, and then wait for the results? Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. I appreciate your time and patience. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, just by listening to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. And yes, for now, just get the X-ray done at your convenience, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – before your appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you today.
