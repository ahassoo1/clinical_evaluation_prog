DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Auelua, was it? Yes, that’s right. Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My daughter kept telling me I should get a check-up, said I’m getting to be an old woman and things start… failing. I don’t feel failing, but she worries. She booked this appointment for me, really. I haven’t been to a doctor in ages, not since… well, never you mind. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s wonderful that your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s never too late to start regular check-ups. A proactive approach is always best. So, even though you feel well, we can do a general assessment just to make sure everything’s as it should be. To start, could you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. Honestly, I feel… fine. A little tired, perhaps. But who isn’t these days? I get up, I make my breakfast, I watch my shows… I used to be very active, you know. Volunteered at the hospital for years. Surgical tech, that was my job. But my hands aren't what they used to be. Everything feels a bit… slower. It's just age, I suppose. I don't really do much anymore, so I can't say I'm feeling particularly unwell, just…old. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Calvery. It's good to know you’re feeling generally okay, and it’s perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older. And slowing down is completely understandable. The fact that you were a surgical tech for years is impressive! That’s a physically demanding job. You mentioned feeling a bit tired. Is this a new fatigue, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… gradual. Very gradual. It didn’t just happen one day, you know? Just… over time. I used to be able to get everything done, house cleaning, gardening, visiting friends… now, I find myself resting more. Taking naps, mostly. And not sleeping as well at night. It’s probably just… getting old. My husband always said I was a busybody. Perhaps I wore myself out. He’s gone now, of course. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been very active throughout your life, and it's natural to experience changes in energy levels over time, especially after a loss like yours. It’s important to investigate though, just to rule out anything that might be contributing to the fatigue and sleep issues. When you say not sleeping well, what does that look like?
PATIENT: Well, I don't fall asleep easily, for one. I lie there, and my mind just… races. Thinking about things. Old times, mostly. And then I wake up a couple of times during the night. Not because I need to, just… awake. And sometimes I have trouble getting back to sleep. It’s not every night, mind you. But often enough that it makes me tired during the day. It’s just… annoying, really. Not painful or anything, just… disruptive. I used to sleep like a log.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Difficulty falling asleep, waking during the night, and trouble getting back to sleep – that certainly sounds disruptive. We can definitely explore some strategies to help with that. Now, aside from the fatigue and sleep issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… My hands ache sometimes, but that's just arthritis, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little something for it, helps a bit. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, either. But that's just getting old, isn’t it? And… oh! I’ve been a little more forgetful lately. Not terrible, but… things slip my mind. Names, mostly. And where I put things. It’s probably just age, too. My daughter keeps telling me I need to write things down. Honestly, she worries too much.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're aware of some common changes that can come with age, and it’s good that you're paying attention to your body. It's always better to be proactive. The hand aches with arthritis, the eyesight changes, and some forgetfulness are all things we can discuss. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about any past medical conditions you've had, or any surgeries you've undergone?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a difficult question. It was so long ago, you know? I had my tonsils out when I was a child, of course. And… let me think… I had a hysterectomy, a long time ago. When I was still quite young, actually. And… I broke my wrist once, fell down the stairs. That was years ago, too. As for medical conditions… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years. The doctor put me on medication. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed. Yes, that was it. I think. It's all a bit of a blur. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s understandable that it’s hard to remember details from a long time ago. Tonsils out as a child, hysterectomy, broken wrist, and high blood pressure – that gives me a good starting point. Do you currently take any medications for your high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let me see… I take Lisinopril, one tablet every morning for my blood pressure. And…oh! And I take a little something for the arthritis, it’s called… Naproxen, yes. Two tablets a day when my hands are really bothering me. That's it, I think. Unless… Oh! Sometimes I take Tylenol for a headache, but that's just as needed. Not every day, just when I have a headache.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Calvery. That’s very helpful. Lisinopril for blood pressure, Naproxen for arthritis as needed, and Tylenol for headaches as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think... No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that's long gone. My daughter always asks me that, though. Says I should be careful. I think she worries too much. No, no allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Mrs. Calvery, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That's another difficult question. My parents are both gone now, of course. My mother… she had heart problems, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. Yes, that was it. And my brother… he had high blood pressure, like me. Honestly, I don't know much about it. My family didn't really talk about these things. It was a different time, you know? We just… dealt with it as it came. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mrs. Calvery. History of heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your father, and high blood pressure in your brother – that gives me a good starting point. It’s perfectly alright that you don't know all the details. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh, dear. Well… I don't really do much these days. I live alone, in the house my husband and I bought years ago. I watch a lot of television. I used to be very active, you know? Gardening, volunteering… but my hands aren’t what they used to be. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but… it’s hard when you live alone. Mostly, I just try to take it easy. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mrs. Calvery. It sounds like you've had a very full life, and now you’re enjoying a quieter pace. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a general assessment of how you’re doing. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose so. I haven't had a proper check-up in ages. It probably wouldn't hurt. Just… don't poke around too much, alright? My hands are sensitive enough as it is. I suppose you know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Calvery. I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower left side. I’m going to listen again after you take a few deep breaths. Still some crackling, but it's not significant at this point. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing concerning. Lastly, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the lower right quadrant. Any pain there when I press?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… yes. A little bit. It’s just… a dull ache. It comes and goes, really. I didn’t think much of it. Probably just… old age. Not terrible, but… yes. A little bit of pain there. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I suppose. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know. A dull ache in the lower right quadrant for a few weeks is something we should investigate further. It could be a number of things, and it's best to rule out anything serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to check for infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a urine analysis to check for any urinary tract issues. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… a CT scan… It sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I don't like tests. I always worry. What are you looking for, exactly? Is it something terrible? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but I really don't like the sound of a CT scan.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Calvery. It is a lot, and it's natural to be worried. I want to assure you that ordering these tests doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It simply allows us to get a more complete picture of what's going on and rule out any potential problems. The CT scan will allow us to see your organs in detail and identify the cause of the pain in your lower right abdomen. It could be something as simple as constipation or a muscle strain, or it could be something more serious, like an infection or inflammation. I know it sounds daunting, but the CT scan is a very safe and effective procedure. We will do everything we can to make you comfortable. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll write the orders now, and the lab will schedule you for an appointment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary… Just… please explain everything to me afterwards, alright? I don't understand all the medical terms. And… I get nervous easily. Yes. Write the orders. And please, explain everything afterwards. Slowly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Calvery. I will absolutely explain everything to you in detail, slowly and clearly. No medical jargon, I promise. We’ll go over the results together when they come back, and I'll answer any questions you have. I’ll also give you a written summary of the findings. Okay, I’ve just written the orders for the blood work, urine analysis, and CT scan. The lab will contact you to schedule the appointments. They’ll likely want to do the blood work first, then the urine analysis, and finally the CT scan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage the discomfort in your abdomen. It’s called Acetaminophen, and you can take it as needed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… yes. I think so. My daughter probably has some. Oh, and… will the CT scan… will it make me tired? I have a hair appointment on Friday, and I don’t want to be too tired to get it done. It's important, you know. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don't like waiting. Waiting makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen is a common pain reliever, and it should help manage the discomfort. And yes, your daughter likely has some. As for the CT scan, it shouldn’t make you significantly tired. You will need to lie still for a short period of time, but it’s generally a well-tolerated procedure. You should be able to go about your normal activities afterwards, including your hair appointment on Friday. The results usually take a few days to come back, typically 2-3 business days for the blood work and urine analysis, and a bit longer for the CT scan – around 5-7 business days. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mrs. Calvery?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… please explain everything clearly afterwards, alright? I don't want to be confused. And thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I'm just… a little nervous. But thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Calvery. I promise I will explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. That’s my priority. And you’re very welcome. It’s perfectly alright to be nervous. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here’s a copy of the orders for the tests, and the prescription for the pain reliever. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you for a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Have a good day, Mrs. Calvery, and please try to relax.
