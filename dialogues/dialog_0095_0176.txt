DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. Really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, more than two days of hiccups. That is bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started, I guess, after I had a really big laugh with some friends. We were reminiscing about old times, silly stuff, and I just… started. At first, I thought it would pass, you know? But it hasn't. They come and go, not really a pattern, but pretty frequently. It’s like… every few minutes, sometimes less.
DOCTOR: Alright. So they started after a bout of laughter, and they've been pretty consistent for over two days. Do you recall anything else happening around the time they started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing immediately comes to mind. We were eating… I had some lentil soup, and a little bit of spicy chicken. Oh! And I had a fizzy drink, a bright orange soda. Does that matter? It was really cold, too. We were outside, it was a warm evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, lentil soup, spicy chicken, and a cold, fizzy orange soda. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse or better?
PATIENT: No, not really. I tried holding my breath, like you’re supposed to, but that didn't do anything. Drinking water doesn't help, either. Actually… thinking about it, when I’m really distracted, like talking to someone, I forget about them for a moment, but as soon as I stop talking, they come back. It’s a bit odd.
DOCTOR: That is interesting – that they seem to lessen with distraction. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no feeling sick. Just… the hiccups. They’re tiring, honestly. It interrupts everything. I manage a little entertainment venue, you see, and I need to talk to people constantly. It's hard to explain to customers why I keep… interrupting myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other symptoms, just the persistent hiccups and they seem to be worse when you're not distracted. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Hmm… let me see. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been controlled with medication for a while now. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. Other than that, nothing major, just the usual things, colds and flu, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. What medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything the doctors have given me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Do you have any family history of… let’s say, any neurological conditions, or problems with swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some memory problems when she got older, but nothing specific diagnosed. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had something with his throat, a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know exactly what it was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, a bit of memory issues in your mother and swallowing difficulties in an uncle. And just to cover all bases, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don’t smoke. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. And I’ve never touched anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just quickly check your abdomen. It's just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don’t feel anything unusual. Everything sounds normal so far. It's likely this is a benign case of persistent hiccups, possibly triggered by something you ate or a bit of irritation to the diaphragm. However, since they’ve been going on for over two days, it’s good we’ve checked things out. We can try a few things. I’d like you to avoid fizzy drinks and spicy foods for a few days and see if that helps. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can definitely do that. No fizzy drinks or spice. That’s… actually quite easy, to be honest. I was getting tired of the spice anyway. Is there anything else? Anything I can take, or… will it just go away on its own? I really need to get rid of these hiccups. They’re driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can try a medication called Baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant and can sometimes help with persistent hiccups. It requires a prescription. I’ll write one for you. Start with 10 milligrams three times a day. If it doesn't help after three days, we can increase the dosage. However, I want to be cautious. While rare, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. If you experience any of the following, please go to the emergency room immediately: difficulty breathing, chest pain, or if you start vomiting. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Baclofen, 10 milligrams, three times a day. And if it gets worse – difficulty breathing, chest pain, vomiting – go to the emergency room. Got it. That sounds… reassuring, actually. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to look at me. Hopefully, this medication will do the trick.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Redeye. I hope so too. I’ll also give you a printed sheet with information about Baclofen and the warning signs to look out for. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to see how you're doing, if you'd like. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That's everything, really. A follow-up in a week sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor Vanochten. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll go home and try to relax… and avoid spicy food! .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the prescription and the information sheet. Get some rest, and avoid those triggers. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Redeye. .
