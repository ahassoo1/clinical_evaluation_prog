DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Bilstein, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Genette Bilstein. It’s… a pleasure to meet you, Doctor. Though I don't rightly recall making an appointment. Not that’s it’s a bad thing, mind you. Just… things slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. The details aren't always crucial. Let's focus on why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The legs. My legs have been… troublesome. At night, mostly. They just… ache. And clench up. It wakes me sometimes, you see. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More like a… hard knot. It’s been going on for… well, a spell now. I can’t say exactly how long. Weeks, I suppose. Maybe months. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Right. Aching and cramping in your legs, primarily at night. And you’ve noticed this for… some time. Do you find anything relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Well now… sometimes stretching helps a little. I try to wiggle my toes and point my feet, like my mother used to tell me. And getting up and walking around, that seems to loosen things up a bit. But it always comes back. It’s… persistent. I don’t know if that’s the right word, but it feels like it. I used to drink chamomile tea before bed, but I can’t recall if that did anything at all. It all just… blurs together.
DOCTOR: Persistent cramping… Alright. And is this cramping in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Usually both, I think. Though sometimes one is worse than the other. It’s not… predictable, if that makes sense. One night it’s my right leg, the next it’s my left. And sometimes they both bother me at the same time. It’s a little different each time, really. I wish I could be more specific, but… well, like I said, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. Both legs, intermittently. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I haven’t really paid much attention to that. Let me see… They don’t feel swollen, but… I suppose I haven’t been looking, either. Old bones don’t bother much with noticing such things, you know. Is that something I should be looking for? I truly haven’t noticed any difference in size.
DOCTOR: Alright. No noticeable swelling. And have you had any injuries to your legs recently?
PATIENT: Injuries… no, not that I recall. I try to be careful. I don’t go in for much running around these days. I haven’t tripped or fallen, not recently. Though… … there was that little stumble in the garden last spring. But that wasn’t a proper injury, just a bit of a wobble. I caught myself on the rose bush. No harm done, I think. Though it did prick my hand… but that healed right up. I don't believe it affected my legs.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant injury. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just a little something for my arthritis, now and then. When it flares up. It’s… ibuprofen, I believe. The white pills. Not every day, only when I need it. And sometimes a little something for sleep… just a half a tablet. But that’s not regular, either. I try not to take too much of anything, you know. It all makes me a bit… foggy. And that’s no good.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a sleep aid occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything… not that I recall. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, now that I think about it… that penicillin shot when I was a girl… I felt a bit… unwell afterwards. A little rash, maybe? But that was so long ago, I can’t be certain. It wasn’t anything serious, I don't think. Just a bit of itching. I don't believe I've had any serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible reaction to penicillin in the past. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam sounds perfectly reasonable. I haven’t had one of those in… well, a long time. I’m ready whenever you are. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start with your legs. I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. And I'll need to feel your pulses.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. This is… rather high, isn’t it? But I suppose I can manage. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'll try to be still. Though my old bones do creak a bit, you know. Don't mind that.
DOCTOR: Pulses are… present, though somewhat diminished bilaterally. Reflexes are… diminished as well, but not markedly. Any pain with palpation here?
PATIENT: Hmm… Oh, a little. Not sharp, you understand. Just… tender. A dull ache. Like a bruise, almost. It’s… uncomfortable, but I wouldn’t say it’s painful. It’s been like that for… well, a while now. Is that normal? I do tend to bruise easily, you know. Old age, I suppose. Though I try to eat my spinach.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation… Alright. Feet show… mild edema, consistent with diminished circulation. No obvious signs of injury. We'll need to run a few tests to rule out anything serious. I’m going to order a CBC, a CMP, and a D-dimer. Also, a lipid panel. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests… Are those… expensive? I’m not on insurance, you see. I wouldn’t want to be a bother. And what exactly are those tests looking for? I don’t mean to question you, Doctor, but… my husband always handled these things. I’m a bit lost, to be honest. Are they… necessary?
DOCTOR: They are necessary to rule out deep vein thrombosis, assess your kidney function, check your electrolytes, and evaluate your cholesterol levels. The cost… I can’t give you an exact figure, but I can have the billing department contact you with an estimate. And we can discuss options if the cost is a concern. For now, let’s just proceed with the tests. It's best to have a clear picture of what’s going on. A nurse will draw your blood shortly.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If you think it’s best. A clear picture… that sounds sensible. I do appreciate you explaining it, Doctor. And contacting me with the cost… that would be very kind. A nurse, you say? I hope they have a gentle touch. My veins can be… a bit shy. I’ll be ready when they are. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs when possible, and avoid prolonged standing or sitting.
PATIENT: .
