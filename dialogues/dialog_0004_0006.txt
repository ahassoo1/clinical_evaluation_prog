DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, I coughed up some blood. It scared me a little, so I thought I should come get it checked. It happened a couple of times now.
DOCTOR: A couple of times… alright. And when you say “coughed up some blood,” can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Um… it wasn’t a lot, Doctor. More like… streaks. Red streaks in my spit, when I cough. It’s… bright red. Not dark, you know? And it doesn’t hurt when I cough, not usually. Sometimes a little sore afterwards, but not a sharp pain. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. Bright red, no sharp pain… and how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe about a week now? It started small, and I thought maybe I scratched my throat, but then it happened again yesterday, and… well, that’s when I decided to come in. It’s just… worrying. I lost my husband last year, and I don’t want anything else to be wrong. Sorry, I didn’t mean to… get emotional.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Weichers. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, let's go through some basics. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he stopped years ago. He said it was bad for his health. I always told him so, too!
DOCTOR: Very good. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… a little high blood pressure, the doctor said. I take a pill for it, every morning. And I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that’s… old news, I think. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, walk every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication… and a cholecystectomy. Let’s see… what medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s called… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams. I take one every morning with my breakfast. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just a multivitamin. A regular one, you can get at the store. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I take some glucosamine and chondroitin. But not every day, just when they ache. Is that important too? I'm sorry, I don’t want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know everything, Ms. Weichers. Alright, glucosamine and chondroitin as needed. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little cold a few months back, but it didn’t last long. Just a stuffy nose and a sore throat. Nothing serious. I haven’t been sick in a long time, actually. That's why this blood… it’s so strange. Do you think it could be something bad, Doctor? I'm getting a little worried.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Weichers. Worrying won’t help. Now, any family history of lung problems, bleeding disorders, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… um. My mother had… she had some trouble with her lungs when she was older, I think. Emphysema, maybe? She smoked her whole life, sadly. And my grandfather… on my father’s side… he had some bleeding problem, but I don't know what it was exactly. It was a long time ago, and my father didn't talk about it much. I’m sorry, I wish I knew more. I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, but we’ll proceed. Alright, maternal history of emphysema, paternal history of unspecified bleeding disorder. Now, how about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? I… I'm not sure what you mean. Do you mean… like my hobbies? I like to garden, and I walk my dog, a little Shiba Inu named Kiko. He's very cute. I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven't been going since… well, since my husband passed. I mostly stay home now. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, I need to know about your exposure to potential irritants. Do you work in a dusty environment?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, I see. No, Doctor. I’m a physical therapist. I work with people in their homes, mostly. So, not really dusty. Sometimes a little pet dander, but nothing too bad. I try to keep things clean for my patients. It’s important, you know? I need to keep a sterile environment. I mostly help people with their exercises and mobility. It's a good job. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, as long as you give it to me! I really don't think I'm allergic to anything. I wish I could be more helpful with all this history. It's all a little blurry, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s move on to a physical exam, then. I need to listen to your lungs and check your vital signs. Please, sit back and relax. I'm going to need you to take a deep breath for me when I ask.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… good. I’ll try to relax. It’s just… a little scary, you know? But I trust you. Just let me know when you want me to breathe, and I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Your respiratory rate is within normal limits. Auscultation reveals… some mild wheezing in the lower lobes bilaterally. No crackles or rhonchi. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Your throat appears slightly irritated, but no obvious signs of infection.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? What does “wheezing” mean, Doctor? And what about the irritation? Is that why I coughed up blood? I’m getting a little anxious now. Is it serious? Should we do more tests?
DOCTOR: Let's not panic, Ms. Weichers. Wheezing indicates some narrowing of the airways, which could be due to a variety of factors. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. The throat irritation could be a minor inflammation, or simply a coincidence. However, given the hemoptysis – that's the medical term for coughing up blood – we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. We'll also check your coagulation factors, given the family history.
PATIENT: Okay… a chest X-ray and blood tests. That sounds… thorough. I appreciate that, Doctor. So, you think it could be something with my lungs? Or maybe my blood? I hope it’s not too serious. Where do I go for the X-ray? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The radiology department is just down the hall, room 204. They’ll need this order. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity. And if the hemoptysis worsens, or if you develop a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Room 204 for the X-ray, and avoid activity. 24 to 48 hours for the results. And go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I… I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any medication I should take? Or anything I should avoid eating?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Weichers, there is nothing else at this time. Just follow those instructions. We’ll discuss the results when they come in. I have other patients waiting. You’ll receive a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you again for your time. I will follow your instructions. I appreciate your help. .
