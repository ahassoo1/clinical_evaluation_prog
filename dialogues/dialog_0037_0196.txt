DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... right. Well, I've just been… tired. Really tired. For a long time now, I think. It's hard to say how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit foggy these days. It just… doesn't go away. I just want to feel normal again, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. Fatigue can be really disruptive, and it’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. It is helpful to try and pinpoint how long this has been going on, even if it's a rough estimate. Would you say weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear... months, I think. Definitely months. Maybe even... a year? It’s all blurring together. My husband, God rest his soul, he noticed it first, probably. He always kept track of things. I… I don't remember exactly when he started saying something, though. It was before… well, you know. I just feel… worn down. Like a battery that won't hold a charge. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. And I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s understandable that things feel foggy and difficult to recall right now. A year of fatigue is significant. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the fatigue a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. It… it’s just all-over, really. Not like I've been doing too much physical work. It's not muscle tiredness. It’s more… everything feels heavy. Like I'm dragging myself through mud, even when I’ve slept. And I’m still tired when I wake up, which is… frustrating, to say the least. I try to keep busy, you know? But even doing little things… makes me want to just sit down. I don’t have the energy for much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and not relieved by sleep, even with you trying to stay active… that's helpful information. Do you notice the fatigue is worse at a certain time of day, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… afternoons are the worst. Mornings are… okay. Not good, just… less bad. But by two or three o'clock… forget about it. I just want to nap. And sometimes I do nap, but it doesn't really help. It just makes me feel… groggy. Then I can't sleep at night. It’s a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: That’s a very common pattern, Ms. Licano. Afternoon fatigue and disrupted sleep… we definitely need to look into that. Besides the fatigue and sleep issues, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Oh, my joints ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. And I’ve been… forgetful. Worse than usual, anyway. I always misplace things. Keys, glasses… just yesterday I couldn’t remember what I went into the kitchen for! My appetite isn't what it used to be either. Everything tastes… bland. It's probably just old age, though.
DOCTOR: It's good you're sharing all of this with me, Ms. Licano, and it's definitely worth investigating, regardless of age. Joint aches, increased forgetfulness, and decreased appetite alongside the fatigue… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me see… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I was on something for that. Stopped taking it after a while, though. Didn’t seem to be doing much. Other than that… nothing major, I don't think. My husband always handled the medical stuff. I went to the appointments, but I didn’t pay much attention to the details. I'm on Medicare now, of course. I really wish he were here to answer these questions. He always remembered everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely alright, we'll take our time. Medicare is good to know. And don’t worry about not remembering specific details, we’ll work through it. You mentioned being on medication for high cholesterol, but you stopped taking it. Do you remember what the name of that medication was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… no, I really don't. It was a little white pill. That's all I remember. The doctor told me the name, of course, but… it’s just gone from my head. I'm so sorry. I'm not much help, am I? I just want to get to the bottom of this tiredness. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Ms. Licano. It's perfectly common to forget medication names. We can look it up in your records, if you’re comfortable with that. Let me quickly check the computer here… Okay, I see here you were prescribed Atorvastatin a few years back. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Atorva… Atorvastatin? Maybe… vaguely. Yes, that sounds right, I think. That was the one. I stopped taking it because… well, it didn’t seem to make a difference. And I didn’t like taking pills if they weren't going to do anything. Is that alright? I hope I wasn't supposed to keep taking it.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. It's good you were honest with your doctor about stopping it. We can discuss whether to restart it later, depending on what we find. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh, I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. Maybe twenty years ago? Something like that. And… I think I had a hysterectomy too. When I was younger. That’s all I can really remember. It was… a long time ago. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Ms. Licano. It’s alright to feel overwhelmed – we’ll take it at your pace. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and hysterectomy is helpful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble. She was in the hospital a lot when I was growing up. And my brother… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer. He passed away a few years ago. My father… I don't really remember him being sick with anything, to be honest. He died when I was young. It’s all a bit… hazy. It's hard to remember details sometimes. I really wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Ms. Licano. It’s alright that it’s difficult to remember. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your brother’s cancer is valuable information. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, I've never smoked. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. I always hated it. Made the house smell terrible. I try to eat healthy… mostly. I like my sweets, though. Can’t resist a good piece of chocolate. I just feel so… sluggish all the time. It’s hard to enjoy anything when I’m this tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, how would you describe your alcohol consumption?
