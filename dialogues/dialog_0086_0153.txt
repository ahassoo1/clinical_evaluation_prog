DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. Right, yes. Something about a… performance? A check-up for something, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I do a lot of ushering, ticket taking... lobby stuff. They said I needed a clearance. Is that right? I just want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: A clearance… yes, I see a note here about volunteer work. Right. Well, we need to make sure you're physically capable of doing what you’re planning. It's good you're being proactive. "Lobby stuff," as you put it, can actually be quite demanding. Let’s start with the basics. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… well, not constant pain. My knees get a little creaky sometimes, especially if I’ve been on my feet all day. And my back… oh, don't even get me started on my back. It just feels… old, I guess. But it's nothing I haven't dealt with for years. Is that what you mean by pain? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older?
DOCTOR: "Usual aches and pains" can still be important, Mr. Krahn. We need to understand what “usual” means for you. So, the knees and back… when do they bother you most?
PATIENT: Mostly when I’m… standing a lot. Or bending over to pick up dropped tickets, you know? It’s not sharp pain, it's just… a stiffness. And sometimes a dull ache. It eases up when I sit down and rest. Honestly, I don't pay it much attention. I’ve always just pushed through it. Is that… bad? I don’t really go to doctors much.
DOCTOR: “Pushing through it” isn’t always the best strategy, Mr. Krahn. Ignoring things can cause them to worsen. We'll get to the bottom of it. Alright, let’s move on. Besides the knees and back, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little… short of breath sometimes, especially if I have to run to help someone. But that’s just because I’m not as young as I used to be, right? And I forget things… a lot. Names, mostly. Dates. Just… little things. My daughter says I should see someone about that, but… well, you know. I just figured it’s part of getting old too. I don't know… am I supposed to list everything? It feels like a long list.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, you are supposed to list everything. Even if you think it’s insignificant. That's what helps me understand what's going on. Shortness of breath and memory issues are certainly worth discussing. Let’s start with the shortness of breath. When did you first notice this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… hard to say. A few years, I think? Maybe a couple? It started gradually. I just found myself getting winded easier. Like, climbing a flight of stairs would be harder. Or walking quickly to catch the bus. It hasn't gotten much worse, but it’s definitely there. I just try to take things slower. I’m not running marathons, if that’s what you’re thinking. Is it something I should be worried about? I really don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: “Not a bother” is irrelevant, Mr. Krahn. We are here to assess your health. Gradual onset is… concerning. Now, regarding your memory… you mentioned forgetting names and dates. Can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of examples. Just yesterday, a regular customer came through, lovely woman, I see her all the time, and I completely blanked on her name. I knew I knew it, I’d just… lost it. And last week, I forgot what day it was entirely. My daughter had to remind me. It's not like I don’t know who people are, it's just… the details slip away. And sometimes I have trouble remembering things that just happened, like what I had for breakfast. It’s frustrating, honestly. I worry I’m losing my marbles.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's see… I'm pulling up your records here… or what little there is. No prior history of cognitive assessment. Okay. Do you have any family history of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… my mother… she got a little confused towards the end, but we just thought it was old age. She wasn’t really diagnosed or anything. And my father… he was pretty sharp right up until he passed. No, I don’t think there’s a strong family history. It’s just… me. I always worried about becoming like my mother, but I didn’t think it would happen this soon. Is it serious, Doctor? Please be honest. I just want to know what I’m dealing with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, it’s difficult to say definitively without some further investigation. The shortness of breath and memory issues together… they warrant a closer look. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. I'd like to start with a physical exam. And I'm going to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and an exam. I just want to get this sorted out. Honestly, I’m just relieved you’re taking this seriously. It’s good to know I’m not just losing my mind. When can we do the exam? And is the blood work going to be… painful? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you feel that way. We'll start with the exam now. It’s fairly routine – I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. As for the blood work, there will be a small prick, yes, but it's very quick. And the phlebotomist is quite skilled. Alright, if you could just follow me over to the examination table… Please lie down. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure first, then. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. This table looks… sturdy. Hopefully it won't squeak. I hate squeaky tables. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Krahn. No need to worry about the table. I assure you, I've encountered far worse. Now, just breathe normally. One hundred and forty-five over ninety. A little elevated, but not alarming. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished, especially in the lower lobes. Nothing too concerning at this point, but we need to investigate further. Any chest pain, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: No chest pain, Doctor. Not currently. Sometimes a little… tightness, when I’m walking uphill, but I just figured it was my age. Or my weight. I’m not exactly a picture of health, you know? I haven't been as active as I should be. I used to walk a lot more, before my knees started acting up. Is something wrong? You're making it sound like something is very wrong.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I am not suggesting anything is very wrong. I am simply gathering information. Diminished breathing sounds can be caused by a number of things, from simple deconditioning to more significant issues. We need to rule them out. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. Is that alright? It's a little hard to focus, if I’m honest. I think my eyesight is getting worse too. Everything is a bit blurry these days. It’s probably just old age. Everything is falling apart, you know? It's like a house that's been standing for too long. Everything starts to crumble.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within the expected range for your age. Now, stand up slowly, if you can. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and you appear to have some difficulty with balance. Alright, Mr. Krahn, that's enough for the physical exam for now. The blood work will give us more information. We’ll also need to discuss some imaging – a chest X-ray and potentially an MRI of your brain. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Imaging… X-ray and MRI? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it really necessary? I don't like being stuck in those machines. Claustrophobic, you know? And I’ve heard they can be expensive. I’m not exactly rolling in money. Is there… anything else we can do? Perhaps just more blood work? Or a really thorough check-up with a specialist? I’m just not a fan of those machines. At all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your concerns. However, given your symptoms – the shortness of breath, memory issues, unsteady gait – and the findings from the physical exam, imaging is necessary to rule out serious underlying conditions. A chest X-ray is relatively quick and painless. The MRI is more involved, but we can discuss options for managing your claustrophobia – medication, an open MRI, or even breaking the scan into smaller segments. Regarding the cost, we can explore financial assistance programs and work with the billing department to find a solution. But I cannot, in good conscience, proceed without investigating the cause of your symptoms further. It would be irresponsible. Now, are you willing to proceed with the imaging?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Yes. Alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please… please do whatever you can to make it as quick and painless as possible. And… about the claustrophobia… medication would be good. Anything to make it bearable. I just… I don’t want to be stuck in a machine for hours. It sounds awful. When can we schedule it? And… will it tell us what’s wrong? Please tell me it will tell us what’s wrong. I just want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to take beforehand. As for the MRI, we'll schedule that for next week, once we've reviewed the X-ray results. The imaging will help us identify the cause of your symptoms. It won’t necessarily give us a definitive diagnosis, but it will narrow down the possibilities and guide our next steps. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work now, and then we’ll discuss the next steps in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. Thank you for taking this seriously. And for being patient with me. I’m not the easiest patient, I know. Blood work first, then. And the X-ray tomorrow. I guess I’ll just try to… prepare myself. Is there anything I should do to prepare? Or eat? Or… anything?
DOCTOR: You're not difficult, Mr. Krahn. Just… anxious, which is understandable. As for the blood work, nothing special. Fasting is not required. For the chest X-ray, wear loose, comfortable clothing. Avoid wearing any jewelry or metal objects. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. Try to relax. We'll take things one step at a time. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow.
PATIENT: .
