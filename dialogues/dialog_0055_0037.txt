DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… the breathing. It is making a whistling sound, especially when I try to do my exercises. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: A whistling sound, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… when you blow across the top of a bottle. But it comes from inside me, when I breathe. It is worse when I walk fast, or lift things. It did not happen before, only started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you mention this began a few weeks ago, coinciding with increased activity… exercises, specifically. Can you describe these exercises to me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I like to stay strong, you see. I used to be a trainer, long ago. Now I walk, and I do some lifting with small weights. Not much, just enough to keep my arms and legs from getting too weak. I also do some bending and stretching, to stay flexible. It's all very gentle, really. But even the gentle things make the whistling now.
DOCTOR: Gentle exercises… I see. And has this whistling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It is usually better when I am resting. If I sit quietly, it is… not there. But as soon as I start moving, even just walking to the kitchen, it can start. Sometimes it is just a little puff, and sometimes it is very loud. It makes me feel… tired, worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Tired, understandably. Now, Mrs. Kilton, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this whistling sound?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my chest feels a little tight. Not painful, just… squeezed. And I have been coughing a little more than usual. It is a dry cough, not much mucus. It doesn't keep me up at night, but I notice it more during the day now. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A dry cough and occasional chest tightness… it could be relevant. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I do not want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. We’ll begin with auscultation of your lungs. Just relax. …Alright. Breath sounds are… diminished bilaterally, with some scattered wheezing, predominantly in the lower lobes. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart.
PATIENT: Okay. Diminished… that does not sound good, does it? I am trying to relax, Doctor. It is hard when I worry about what you are hearing. Is it… serious? My husband always said I worried too much. But he is gone now.
DOCTOR: It is… not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, Mrs. Kilton. Reduced breath sounds can be indicative of several things. Now, let’s proceed. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Now, I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with this small device on your finger.
PATIENT: Okay. Oxygen… that is good to check. I do try to eat healthy, you see. Lots of fruits and vegetables. My daughter always tells me I eat too much garlic, but it keeps the sickness away, I think.
DOCTOR: …Oxygen saturation is 92 percent. That is… within an acceptable range, though perhaps a little low. I’d also like to palpate your chest to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. No significant tenderness noted. Alright, Mrs. Kilton. Based on my examination, your symptoms and decreased breath sounds suggest possible mild airway obstruction. It's likely a combination of age-related changes and perhaps some underlying inflammation.
PATIENT: Inflammation… like swelling? Is it my lungs? What does that mean, Doctor? I am a bit frightened now. Will I need… medicine? Or a hospital? My daughter would worry so much…
DOCTOR: Now, Mrs. Kilton, please try to remain calm. It does not necessarily indicate anything severe. “Inflammation” simply refers to a slight irritation of the airways. And no, a hospital is certainly not indicated at this time. Based on your age and history, it’s likely some degree of chronic bronchitis, exacerbated by your activities. I recommend a trial of an inhaled bronchodilator to help open your airways and alleviate your symptoms. We can also discuss some pulmonary rehabilitation exercises to help improve your breathing technique. I’m going to write you a prescription for albuterol. It’s a common medication, and should provide some relief. If your symptoms do not improve within a week, or if they worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. We may need to consider a chest X-ray at that time to rule out other possibilities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Albuterol… I do not think I have heard of that. Is it… a strong medicine? Will it make me feel dizzy? And pulmonary… what did you call it? I am a bit confused now, Doctor. Perhaps my daughter should come with me next time. She is very good at understanding these things. But I do want to feel better, you see. I miss my exercises.
DOCTOR: Albuterol is a relatively mild medication, Mrs. Kilton. It's an inhaler that delivers a small dose of medication directly to your lungs to help them open up. It doesn’t typically cause dizziness, though some people experience mild tremors. Pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a program of exercises and breathing techniques designed to improve your lung function. We can discuss referring you to a specialist for that. Look, it’s quite straightforward. I’m prescribing the inhaler. Use it as directed. If you don't feel better, then we will consider further testing. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but it's best to be cautious. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I have taken many things over the years, for headaches and little aches. Nothing ever bothered me. But… how do I use this inhaler? I have never used one before. And… when should I use it? Before my exercises? Or when I start to wheeze? I do not want to do it wrong and make things worse.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will demonstrate the proper technique before you leave. It’s quite simple. You shake the inhaler, exhale fully, and then inhale deeply as you depress the canister. Hold your breath for ten seconds. As for when to use it, use it before your exercises as a preventative measure. If you begin to experience wheezing, use it immediately. It's a rescue medication. Don't overdo it, though. More than two puffs every four hours is unnecessary. I’ve written out detailed instructions on the prescription slip. The nurse will review them with you. Are there any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. Thank you for your time. I do hope it helps. I miss my walking. Perhaps I will see you again soon, if the walking does not improve.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. Do not hesitate to contact the clinic if your symptoms worsen. Good day, Mrs. Kilton. .
