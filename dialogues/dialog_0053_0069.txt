DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiio. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. I’m here for a vaccination, if that’s right? I think it’s time for a booster, but I wasn't entirely sure which one, to be honest. I got a letter, but… well, you know how it is with paperwork.
DOCTOR: A booster, right. Paperwork is a nuisance. Let’s clarify, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I remember getting a few shots last year, and something about flu and… pneumonia, maybe? But I don’t recall exactly which ones were recommended, and I don't want to get one I don't need. Is there a record here?
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Ah, yes. It appears you received a flu vaccine – the high-dose variety – on October 28th of last year, and a pneumococcal 13-valent vaccine – Prevnar 13 – on the same day. So, you’re due for another flu shot this fall, naturally. As for the pneumococcal vaccine… it depends. There are two main types, and it looks like you only had the 13-valent one. Do you have any underlying health conditions, or problems with your immune system?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know, thank you for looking that up. No, nothing like that, Doctor. No problems with my immune system that I’m aware of, and generally pretty healthy, I think. Just… getting older, you know? So, what does that mean about the other pneumococcal vaccine? Do I need both?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, generally, for someone your age – 47 – and with no specific risk factors, the CDC recommends one dose of the pneumococcal 20-valent vaccine – Prevnar 20. It offers broader protection than the older 13-valent vaccine. It's a bit more comprehensive, covering more strains of the bacteria. So, it wouldn’t necessarily be wrong to have had the 13-valent one last year, but the 20-valent is the current recommendation. Are you wanting to go ahead and get that today, or would you like to think about it?
PATIENT: That makes sense. Broader protection sounds good. If it’s the current recommendation, then yes, let’s go ahead and do it today, if that’s alright. I’d rather just get it over with and not have to worry about it. Is there anything else I should be getting while we’re at it?
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s a quick injection, shouldn't be too uncomfortable. As for other vaccines… let me see. Considering your age and health history… have you had a Tdap booster recently?
PATIENT: Tdap? Hmm… I honestly can’t remember, Doctor. It was probably a long time ago. I think I got one when I was younger, maybe before a trip somewhere? But I’m really not sure. Would my records show that?
DOCTOR: Let's see… Ah, here we go. You received a Tdap booster on… February 15th, 2018. That means you’re due for another one. Tdap protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – whooping cough. It’s recommended every ten years, and is especially important to keep updated to protect those around you, particularly infants who are vulnerable. Would you like to go ahead and get that one today as well?
PATIENT: Oh, 2018! That feels like a lifetime ago. Yes, that makes sense to get it updated. Definitely want to protect others, especially babies. If it’s quick like you said, then yes, please, let’s do both today. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me if it’s going to sting!
DOCTOR: Alright. It will be a quick pinch – a small sting, yes, but nothing you won’t handle. And then we’re done. I’ll give you a card with the dates and types of vaccines you received today, just for your records. Now, if you’ll just expose your deltoid… There. All done. Just a little pressure with this cotton ball for a moment. Any immediate reaction?
PATIENT: Oof, okay, that was… a little sharper than I expected! But… alright, I’m okay. Just a little sting, like you said. No, nothing too bad. Just feels a bit sore already, but that's probably normal. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you getting me up-to-date on all this. Do I need to schedule anything else?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal. Some mild soreness, maybe a little fatigue, is common for a day or two. Avoid heavy lifting with that arm, just to be safe. No, nothing else is currently recommended, but we should schedule a general check-up in about a year, just to monitor your overall health. And, of course, come in sooner if you experience any unusual symptoms. Here's that card. Are there any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Pitmon. You’ve put my mind at ease. I’ll keep an eye on my arm and schedule that check-up. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Stay well, Mr. Paguiio.
