DOCTOR: Good morning, Courtnye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, it's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on one of those blood thinner meds, so I figured I should get it checked out. I don't want anything serious happening, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially being on a blood thinner. That’s very good of you to come in to get it checked out. To start, can you tell me a little more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, it started, I guess, maybe a week ago? Just little bumps, like I'd walked into something. But now... they're bigger, and they show up easier. I haven't even done anything to cause some of them, if that makes sense. Like on my arms, just… appeared. And they’re a bit sore, not awful, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Bruising appearing without any known injury is something we want to look into. When you say they “show up easier”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. Like, normally if I bump my arm, maybe I get a little mark, fades quick. Now, even just a light touch feels like it could cause one. And they seem to last longer, too. A week ago, a little bump would be gone in a day or two. Now? Still there, kinda purple-ish. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Courtnye. You’re explaining it very well. It sounds like the bruising is more significant and prolonged than usual for you. Just to get a clearer picture, are these bruises all over your body, or are they concentrated in certain areas?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and legs, I think. I haven't really looked everywhere, to be honest. I noticed them first on my forearms when I was washing dishes the other day. And then I saw a couple on my shins. Nothing on my stomach or back, as far as I can tell. I haven't checked my face, actually. Should I?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't noticed any on your face, but yes, it would be helpful to take a quick look, just to be thorough. And you’re right to be concerned, given you’re on a blood thinner. Now, let's talk about that medication. What blood thinner are you currently taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Okay, one sec... It's... Warfarin. 5 milligrams, one tablet every evening. I’ve been on it for about six months now, since my doctor in town diagnosed me with atrial fibrillation. He’s good, but he's been busy lately and hard to get an appointment with, which is why I came here. It's Doctor Halversen, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Halversen’s name is helpful, thank you. Six months on Warfarin is good to know. And you haven’t changed the dose at all in that time?
PATIENT: No, never. He started me on 5 milligrams, and that’s what I’ve been taking every night, same time, same everything. I'm really good about taking my pills, I promise. I set an alarm and everything. I know how important it is to be consistent with these things.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Courtnye. Consistency is very important with Warfarin. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No bleeding gums or anything like that. No nosebleeds. No weird headaches or dizziness. Just… the bruises. Oh! Wait. I have been a little more tired lately, now that I think about it. Just kinda run down, but I figured it was just the heat. It’s been really hot, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, the increased fatigue is good to note. And the heat definitely can contribute to feeling run down. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit more. Besides the atrial fibrillation, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was ages ago. And I have high blood pressure, but I take a pill for that too - Lisinopril, I think it's called. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy for my age. I try to eat right and walk when I can, but it's hard sometimes. Is this taking a long time, Doctor? I have a thing later.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t taking a long time at all, Courtnye. We’re just gathering information to get a clear picture. And it's important to know everything so we can make the best decisions. Just a few more questions, and then I’ll do a quick physical exam. You mentioned high blood pressure. Are you taking the Lisinopril consistently, and do you know your most recent blood pressure reading?
PATIENT: Yes, I take it every morning with my other pills. I haven’t had it checked in a while, though. Maybe a few months ago? Doctor Halversen checks it at my appointments. He said it was okay then, but I don’t remember the exact number. I'm terrible with numbers, honestly. Is that bad? Should I know that?
DOCTOR: It's okay not to remember exact numbers, Courtnye. We have your records from Doctor Halversen to refer to. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with bleeding disorders or a history of easy bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I know of, no. My mom had high blood pressure, like me, and my dad had diabetes, but nobody ever talked about bleeding problems. I have a lot of cousins, but I don’t see them much, so I wouldn’t know. I don’t think so, though. We're pretty tough people, Tongans. We don't usually complain much. Is this almost done, Doctor? I really do have to go soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And yes, we are almost done with the questions. Just a few more, then I’ll examine you. Now, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not every day. And I take Tylenol when my arthritis acts up. That’s it. I used to take something for heartburn, but I stopped because it didn’t seem to help much. And I drink a lot of herbal tea, different kinds. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the herbal tea. Some herbal teas can interact with Warfarin, so it’s good you mentioned that. Do you recall which kinds you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. All sorts! Chamomile, peppermint… sometimes ginger, especially when my stomach is upset. And I like hibiscus tea. I get them from the store, just regular tea bags. Nothing fancy. I don’t drink tons of it, but maybe a couple of cups a day. Does hibiscus tea do something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Hibiscus tea can potentially interact with Warfarin, so it’s good you mentioned it. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way. Okay, is that it? Can we get to the part where you look at me now? I really appreciate you seeing me so quickly, Doctor. It's a big help.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all the questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Courtnye. I appreciate you providing all of this information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then take a look at the bruising on your arms and legs. It will just take a few minutes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just please be quick, if you can. I really do have to be somewhere later.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Now, looking at the bruising… it appears to be mostly on your lower arms and shins, as you mentioned. The bruises are varying shades of purple and blue, and they feel slightly tender to the touch. There's no swelling or warmth around the areas. I don't see any signs of internal bleeding. Your bruising does seem more significant than what I would typically expect, especially given you’re on Warfarin. We’ll need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want to order a complete blood count and a Prothrombin Time test to check your blood clotting ability. We'll also check your liver function. Do you have any concerns about getting blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay. No, I don’t mind getting blood work, but I hate needles. Always have. But if you need to do it, you need to do it. It’s just… unpleasant. And how long will it take to get the results? I'm hoping it’s not too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your dislike of needles, Courtnye. We’ll get it done as quickly and gently as possible. The phlebotomist here is very good. The results typically take about 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury or bruising. And please let me know immediately if you notice any signs of excessive bleeding, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Okay, avoiding injury… got it. And I will call if anything… bleeds a lot. 24-48 hours... that's not terrible. Just hoping it's not anything serious. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… what could it be? Is it possible the Warfarin is just… not working right? I mean, is that a thing?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Courtnye. It is possible the Warfarin dosage isn’t quite right for you. The goal with Warfarin is to find the sweet spot where it prevents blood clots without causing excessive bleeding. Sometimes, it takes a bit of trial and error to get the dosage just right. However, there are other possible causes for increased bruising as well. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, an underlying medical condition, or even certain medications or supplements. That’s why we need to run the blood work to get a clearer picture. For now, let's not jump to any conclusions. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible and discuss them thoroughly. I'm going to write you a lab order for the CBC, PT, and liver function tests. You can go to the lab right down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. Do you think you’ll be able to get that done today?
PATIENT: Yes, I can go to the lab today. Right after this, actually. The sooner the better, right? Is there anything else I need to know before I go? Should I eat anything special beforehand? Or avoid anything?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Courtnye. The sooner the better is right. You don’t need to do anything special before the blood draw. You don’t need to fast, and there are no specific foods or medications to avoid. Just drink plenty of water beforehand, as that makes it easier for the phlebotomist to draw the blood. Here's the lab order, and the address is on the form. They’ll call me with the results when they’re available. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you experience any concerning symptoms while you’re waiting for the results. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me so quickly, even though I’m probably just being a worrywart. I’ll go get the blood work done now and hopefully we'll have some answers soon.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Courtnye. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, and I’m glad you came in to get this checked out. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon. Take care.
