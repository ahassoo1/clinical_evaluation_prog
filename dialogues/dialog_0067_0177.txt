DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pfennig, you say? Hmm. Well, it's... down there. Something's just... not right. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, but it's been... leaking. A little bit. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It's been going on... oh, I don't know, a while now. Maybe a week? Two? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jimmi, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things are quite common, and we’re here to figure out what’s going on and how to help. You said it’s been leaking for about a week or two?
PATIENT: Yeah, a week or two. Maybe longer. Like I said, I lose track. It's not painful, exactly. More... icky. And it smells a little funny. Not bad bad, just... not clean. I been tryin' to keep things extra tidy, but it just keeps happenin'. I don't know what's causin' it. I ain't been with anyone, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good information to know, thank you. And you're right to mention the odor – that can be helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing some vaginal leakage with a noticeable smell. To get a better understanding, could you describe the leakage?
PATIENT: Leakage? How to describe it… It’s not like when you pee, definitely not that. It’s… thinner than that. More watery, I guess. And kinda… yellowish. Not bright yellow, more… old yellow? Does that make sense? It’s not a lot, like I said. Just enough to make me feel… unclean. I been usin' those feminine washes, but they don't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, "old yellow" is a very helpful description, Jimmi. And not like urination, thinner and watery. You mentioned you've been using feminine washes. Have you noticed any irritation or burning with those, or any itching?
PATIENT: No, no burnin' or itchin'. Just... nothin' helps! I used to use a different kind, a perfumey one, but my niece, she said those are bad for you. Said they mess up your… your balance. So I switched to this plain one. It don't smell nice, but I figured plain was better. And it ain't helpin' none! Everything just feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: That's good you switched to a plain wash, that was a smart move. It sounds like you're experiencing some discharge, and it's understandable that you're feeling uncomfortable. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any previous vaginal infections, like yeast infections or bacterial vaginosis?
PATIENT: Vaginal… what now? Infections? Oh dear. I don't think so. I mean, I've had the usual lady problems, you know, when I was younger. But I don't remember any names for things. Back then, the doctor just gave you somethin' and you took it. I don't think I've had anythin' special lately. Just... this. It’s new. I haven’t been sick with anything else, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous diagnosed vaginal infections. That’s good to know. And just this new discharge. Have you had any changes in your menstrual cycle recently - anything different with the bleeding, the timing, or the amount?
PATIENT: Oh, the bleedin'. Well, I haven't had any bleedin' for… a long time now. Years. I'm way past that stage, honey. I’m too old for all that nonsense. It stopped a long time ago. So no, no changes, 'cause there ain't been any. Just this... leakin'. It's just… unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, you're postmenopausal, so no menstrual bleeding. That helps us narrow things down. Now, let's talk about your past medical history more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... My knees bother me somethin' fierce when it rains. And my back, always achin'. But that's just old age, I reckon. I had a little trouble with my heart a few years back, a flutterin' feeling. The doctor put me on a pill for it, but I stopped takin' it. It didn't seem to be doin' much, and I don't like takin' pills if I don't have to. Other than that... I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I eat my vegetables. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee and back pain, and a history of a heart flutter that you stopped taking medication for. That's helpful information. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no. Names just don't stick with me, honey. A little white pill, I think. Maybe a pink one? It was a long time ago. The doctor said it was for my heart, somethin' about it beatin' too fast sometimes. But it made me feel kinda dizzy, so I stopped. I figured a little flutter now and then was better than feelin' all woozy. I been doin' alright without it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white or pink pill for a heart flutter, stopped due to dizziness. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... I think I got a little itchy when I eat shrimp sometimes, but I love shrimp so much I usually ignore it. And I got stung by a bee when I was a little girl, and my arm swelled up somethin' awful, but that was years ago. Nothing serious, really. I don't think I'm allergic to anythin' important. Mostly, I just get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible shrimp allergy, and a bee sting reaction years ago. And feeling tired easily. Now, one last question about your history. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I take a little somethin' for my knees, a brown pill. I forget what it's called. And sometimes I take a vitamin D, when I remember. My niece says I need it for my bones. But I don't take anythin' regularly, not really. I mostly just try to get enough rest. And drink my tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brown pill for your knees and Vitamin D occasionally. Thank you, Jimmi, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, an exam? Well... alright, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. It's just... a little embarrassing, you know? But if it'll help figure out what's wrong, then go ahead. Just be gentle, honey. My bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take your blood pressure. After that, I’d like to do a pelvic exam to take a look at the source of the discharge. This will involve using a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can see inside. I’ll also collect a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A speculum? That sounds… pokey. And a sample? You mean… from down there? Well, I don’t know, honey. It all sounds a little scary. I ain't had anythin' done like that before. Will it hurt? And what are you lookin' for, exactly? I don’t want you pokin' around too much, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jimmi, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to make you comfortable. The speculum is gently inserted and opened to allow me to visualize the vaginal canal and cervix. It can feel a little bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. The sample collection will also be quick and may cause minimal discomfort. I'm looking for any signs of inflammation, irritation, or infection. The lab tests will help me identify the cause of the discharge, such as a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or a sexually transmitted infection. If everything looks normal, we can explore other potential causes. We can take things slowly and stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Would you like me to explain any of this in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… alright. If you say it won’t hurt too much. But I want you to be real gentle, honey. And if it does hurt, you stop right away, you hear? I don't want any pokin’ and proddin’. And tell me what you're lookin' for, exactly. I like to know what's goin' on. Explain it to me like I’m a little girl. Slow and easy, that's what I want.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi, slow and easy is exactly what we’ll do. I will explain every step as I go, and we'll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. Think of your vagina like a tunnel, and your cervix is the doorway at the end of the tunnel. The cervix protects your uterus. Sometimes, things can get a little irritated or infected in that tunnel, and that can cause discharge. The speculum helps me gently open the tunnel so I can see the doorway and look for any signs of irritation or infection. The sample I collect will be a small amount of fluid that I use to check under a microscope and see if there are any bacteria or yeast causing the problem. It's like checking for tiny bugs. I’ll start by having you lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I’ll use a warm speculum and plenty of lubrication to make it as comfortable as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Lie on my back, you say? And plenty of lubrication? That sounds… better. Still nervous, but… alright. Just be real gentle, honey. And tell me what you’re doin’ every step of the way. Don’t just poke around without warnin' me. And if it hurts, you stop. Promise?
DOCTOR: I promise, Jimmi. I will be very gentle and explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to gently insert the warm speculum into your vagina. It’s shaped a little like a duckbill, and it will gently open the vaginal walls so I can see your cervix. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m using plenty of lubrication to make it as comfortable as possible. Okay, Jimmi, I can see your cervix now. It looks a little… inflamed, a bit red. That could be causing the discharge. Now, I’m going to gently collect a small sample of the discharge using a swab. It will feel a little bit like a quick tickle. Okay, all done! I've collected the sample. Now I'll gently remove the speculum. That may have felt a little uncomfortable, but it's all finished now. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… that was a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… strange. It felt cold, even with the warm thing. And that tickle… yeah, that wasn’t pleasant. My insides feel… poked. But I’m glad it’s over. It's good you told me what you were doin' the whole time, honey. That helped. Now, what happens with that little swab? And what does "inflamed" mean, exactly? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I’m glad it's over for you too, Jimmi, and I appreciate you letting me know how you were feeling. It's perfectly normal to feel a little poked or uncomfortable afterward. The swab I collected will be sent to the lab, and they'll examine it under a microscope to see if there are any bacteria, yeast, or other organisms causing the inflammation. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. “Inflamed” means your cervix is a little red and swollen. It’s like when you scrape your knee – it gets red and irritated. It can be caused by a lot of different things, like an infection, irritation from feminine washes, or even hormonal changes. It's not necessarily bad, but we need to figure out the cause so we can treat it properly. I'm going to order some lab tests now to help us figure out what's going on. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding feminine washes and douching. Also, try to wear loose-fitting cotton underwear.
PATIENT: Loose cotton underwear, you say? Well, that don’t sound too bad. I always liked cotton. Better than those scratchy nylon things. And no more washes… good. I didn't like those anyway. They never really made me feel clean. So, just wait for the lab? How long will that take, exactly? And what if it’s somethin’ bad? You think it’s somethin’ bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. And honestly, Jimmi, I don't think it's anything serious. The inflammation could be caused by something as simple as an irritation or a minor infection, which is easily treated with medication. However, it’s important to get the lab results to confirm the cause and make sure we’re addressing the right problem. Do you have any other concerns or questions I can address right now?
PATIENT: Well… no, I don't think so. I’m still a little nervous, but you’ve explained everything pretty good, honey. Just try not to poke around too much next time, alright? And call me as soon as you know somethin’. I don’t like bein’ in the dark. Thank you, Doctor Pfennig. I appreciate you takin’ the time with an old lady like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. I’m happy to help. And I promise, I'll be as gentle as possible during any future exams. I understand your concern about being in the dark, and I'll be sure to call you as soon as the lab results are available. Here's some information on vaginal health you might find helpful. And here's my card with my number. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before I call with the results. Take care, Jimmi, and I'll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, honey. You take care too. Bye bye.
