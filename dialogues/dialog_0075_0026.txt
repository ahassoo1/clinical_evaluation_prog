DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Panjoj. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. I don’t have the energy I used to, and honestly, it's quite bothersome. I used to be a commercial diver, you know. Very active work, it was. Now… now I mostly just sit.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, alright. And it sounds like a significant change from your previous activity level as a commercial diver. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not just… feeling sleepy, if you understand. It’s like… everything takes so much effort. Even getting up from a chair. And my muscles… they ache sometimes, not all the time, but enough to notice. Honestly, I don't remember ever feeling this worn out before. Though, things aren’t as clear as they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is impacting your daily life quite a bit. And you mentioned muscle aches and some… difficulty with clarity?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, the clarity. It's not… well, it’s not like I'm losing my mind, but I forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I had for breakfast… things like that. It’s more annoying than anything. Though, my husband, bless his heart, has to remind me of… well, quite a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good you’re aware of these changes and that your husband is helping you. Both the tiredness, muscle aches, and memory concerns are things we need to investigate further. Let’s start with a review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… Well, I’ve had the usual things, I suppose. A bit of arthritis in my knees, the doctor said. Nothing major. And I had a nasty flu a few years back, but I recovered. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s just tiredness, isn’t it? I’ve always been a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis and a past flu. And you're right to be strong – it’s important to remember that. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder taken out, years ago. A long time ago. And… I think I had something done on my knee once, a small procedure. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, I can barely remember the details. I was younger then.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my parents are both… gone now, bless their souls. I had a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. He moved to America, you know. Very strange fellow. As for illnesses… I don’t really recall anyone having anything… serious. Maybe a bit of the heart trouble, on my mother’s side, I think. But nothing definite. Honestly, I wasn’t very close to them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I take a little something for my arthritis, you know, the usual painkiller. Ibuprofen, I think it's called. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take a little something for that too. A small pill, I get it at the drugstore. Not every night, just when I really need it. Can’t remember the name… Honestly, Doctor, I have enough trouble remembering what I had for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, more or less. Though, I don’t much care for broccoli, if that counts. But that’s a dislike, not an allergy, you understand? My husband is very careful about what he cooks, bless him.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, years ago, but he quit, thankfully. Dreadful habit, you know. Absolutely dreadful. Makes you smell awful, and it’s bad for your health. I always told him that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very small glass, you understand. Mostly red wine. My husband enjoys a beer now and then too. But nothing excessive, you know? We're not… those people. We have always been very sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your activity level these days?
PATIENT: Activity… Well, as I said, it’s not what it used to be. I used to be so active, diving and everything. Now… now I mostly sit. I potter around the house a bit, do a little gardening when the weather is nice. But I get tired very quickly, you see? Even just walking to the shops is a bit of an effort. Honestly, it's quite depressing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ardelle. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a basic neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, alright, I suppose. I don't much like being poked and prodded, but if it's going to help, then go ahead. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel like myself again. It’s dreadful feeling so… weak.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Not drastically high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, mostly on the lower lobes. This could be due to a number of things – fluid retention, a slight congestion… We'll need to investigate further. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which could be related to the tiredness you're experiencing. And finally, I'll just do a quick neurological assessment… Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, my. All those numbers and sounds… It’s a bit overwhelming, Doctor. Yes, yes, I can squeeze your hands. There. Is that alright? Honestly, Doctor, I just wish you could tell me what's wrong. It’s all this waiting and poking… It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. Thank you, Ardelle. And I understand your frustration – I want to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible too. Your grip is a little weaker than I’d expect, which is something else we'll need to consider. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The tiredness, muscle aches, memory concerns, and the mild crackling in your lungs could be related to a number of things, including a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, early stages of heart failure, or even something neurological. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. I also want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests? Honestly, Doctor, it’s just one thing after another. But… yes, alright. If it’s going to help, then go ahead. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? It’s dreadful feeling so… weak and forgetful. But... what exactly will these tests do? Do they involve a lot of poking?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, we’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests involve a small needle prick – just a few tubes of blood will be taken from your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and the lab technician will be very gentle. As for the chest X-ray, you’ll simply stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. No poking involved at all. The tests will help us identify any underlying issues that might be causing your symptoms. For example, a vitamin D deficiency can cause fatigue and muscle aches, while a thyroid issue can lead to tiredness and memory problems. The chest X-ray will help us rule out any lung infections or heart problems. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood tests and the chest X-ray. You can take it to the lab at the clinic, and they’ll schedule the tests for you. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It all sounds so… complicated. A requisition form? And the lab… Is it far? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with these things. My husband usually takes care of all the paperwork. But… alright. I’ll try. And the results… How long will that take? I don’t want to be waiting forever, you know. It’s just… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It is unsettling not knowing. The lab is right here in the clinic, just down the hall on your left. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to get your blood drawn, and the X-ray can be done immediately afterwards. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once they’re available, the lab will notify me, and my receptionist will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe weakness, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… 2-3 business days. That sounds like a long time, but alright. And no chest pain or shortness of breath, you say? I’ll remember that. My husband is very good at looking after me, so I’ll let him know. I suppose… I don't think so. That's all the questions I have for now, Doctor. Thank you for… explaining everything. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. It is a lot, and I'm glad I could explain everything a bit better. Please don’t hesitate to contact me or my receptionist if you have any questions or concerns. And remember to rest. Here’s the requisition form. Take your time getting to the lab, and don’t rush. I’ll see you in a few days when the results are back. In the meantime, take care of yourself. And please, if anything changes, don't hesitate to reach out. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bye bye.
