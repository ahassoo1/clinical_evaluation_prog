DOCTOR: Right, Ardelle Oitker… 81 years old. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… well, it's this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. Comes and goes, you see. Makes it hard to do… things. Honestly, I can’t even remember what things, exactly. It’s not like I’m doing a lot these days anyway. My husband, bless him, does most everything.
DOCTOR: Tiredness… okay. Comes and goes, you said. And you mentioned trouble remembering things... is that new, or has that been going on for a while now?
PATIENT: Oh, the remembering… it’s always been a bit… patchy. But it’s worse now, I think. Definitely worse. I used to be able to… well, I don't know what I used to be able to do. It's frustrating, you see. Very frustrating. I keep forgetting where I put my spectacles, even though they’re usually right on my nose!
DOCTOR: Alright. Patchy memory… and it’s become more noticeable recently. Do you notice any other changes along with the tiredness and memory issues?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. My muscles… sometimes they ache, terribly ache. Especially after… well, after I’ve been… moving. But I don’t do much moving, as I said. It’s just… a general weakness, I suppose. Like everything's made of lead. Is that what you mean by changes? Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches, weakness… okay. And when you say weakness, is that all over, or is it worse in certain parts of your body?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… mostly my legs, I think. Makes getting up and down a bit of a struggle. I don’t fall, mind you, but it takes… effort. And my arms feel it too, when I’m… when I’m doing… things. It's just… difficult. Everything is just difficult these days. My husband says I complain too much, but he doesn’t understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I always dislike doctors poking and prodding, you know. But if it will help… help me understand this tiredness… then yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 148 over 82, pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Thyroid feels normal. Now, a little strength check... could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is that alright? Not very strong, am I? Always been a bit weak, you know. My mother was the same. Delicate creatures, women. Now, my husband… he was a strong man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little weaker than expected, but not drastically so. And your reflexes… I'm going to tap on your knees a couple of times. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but again, not alarming. Overall, the exam is… fairly unremarkable, but it does point towards some generalized weakness and reduced muscle strength. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history... Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diagnosed… let me think. It was so long ago. The doctor… Dr. Patel, that was his name… he said something about my… my… something with my thyroid, years and years ago. But I think it was fine. They gave me some pills, and I took them for a bit, then stopped. Honestly, I can’t really remember what it was all about. And… well, I broke my wrist once, falling in the garden. But that was a long time ago, too. Is this important? All these questions… it's making my head spin.
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, but don't worry, we'll take our time. Previous thyroid issue… okay. And you stopped taking the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Stopped taking them. Dr. Patel said it was fine, said it wasn't serious. I remember him being very… rushed. Lots of patients, you see. Just a quick check-up, a few pills, and then on to the next one. Honestly, I didn't feel much different either way, so I just… stopped. My husband said it was a waste of money, too. He's very practical, you see. It’s all a bit hazy now. So many doctors over the years… they all look the same.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I get a bit of a rash sometimes, but that’s usually from… well, from something in the garden, I suppose. Roses, maybe. Or the lavender. It's not serious, you see. Just a little itch. Nothing to bother the doctor about. My husband is allergic to bee stings, terribly allergic. Has to carry a little… a little pen thing with him. But me? No. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the thyroid pills you stopped taking?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Nothing. I don't like taking pills, you see. They make me feel… foggy. My husband takes a few things for his… well, for his old age, he says. But me? Nothing. Just a bit of herbal tea sometimes, to help me sleep. Chamomile, mostly. But that’s not a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like we're dealing with generalized weakness, fatigue, and some memory issues. The previous thyroid issue needs to be investigated further, as it could be contributing to your symptoms. I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. We also need to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests. More poking and prodding? Honestly, I dread them. What exactly are you looking for? I don’t understand all these medical… things. What does a Vitamin D level even mean? My husband says I worry too much, but it's hard not to, you see. It's all so… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ardelle. The blood tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Vitamin D is important for energy levels and muscle strength – low levels can cause fatigue and weakness. The thyroid panel will tell us if your thyroid is functioning properly. It's just a routine check, really. We'll take it one step at a time. The lab is just down the hall; they're very good and gentle. And then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… one step at a time, you say? Alright. If you think it's necessary. But please, don't poke too much. And can my husband come with me? I get a bit… flustered, you see, on my own. He’s very good at asking questions, too. He understands all these medical… things. When should I go? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, your husband is welcome to join you. That's a good idea. You can go to the lab anytime this afternoon; it shouldn’t take more than half an hour or so. They’ll draw a small amount of blood. I'll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them. I'll have my nurse call you to set that up. In the meantime, try to get some rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, rest and hydration… yes, I suppose. It’s hard to rest, you see, when you’re feeling so… tired. And honestly, I don't understand why I'm so tired. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous. Just… existing. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… please, make sure they don’t poke too much. And thank you, doctor. Thank you for listening. I’m just… anxious, you see. Very anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. And I promise, we'll be gentle. My nurse will call you soon to schedule your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you feel any new symptoms or if things get worse, don't hesitate to call the office. Alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. New symptoms… I’ll try to remember that. Thank you again, doctor. You’ve been very kind. Now, I suppose I should go and find my husband. He’s probably wondering where I am. I hope these tests aren’t too expensive…
DOCTOR: We'll take care of everything, Ardelle. Don't worry about the cost. My nurse can help you with any billing questions. Have a good afternoon, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, doctor. That’s very kind of you. Alright. Have a good afternoon to you too.
