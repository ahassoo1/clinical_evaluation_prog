DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Boham, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Mikeisha Boham. It is nice to meet you, Doctor… Ruocco, yes? I am sorry, my memory… it is not so good these days.
DOCTOR: Ruocco is fine. Don't bother with formalities. Look, I have a rather full schedule, so let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Sorry. It is my sinuses, I think. They… they bother me. A lot of pressure, and… and it is hard to breathe sometimes. It has been going on for… a while now, I guess. I do not remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Right. Vague, as usual. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. I do not think so. I have not… taken my temperature. I do not feel hot, but maybe… maybe a little tired? It is hard to say. I just feel… stuffy, all the time. Like something is blocking my nose, you know?
DOCTOR: Stuffy. Okay. Any colored discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Colored…? Oh. Um… sometimes. A little bit of… yellow, maybe? Not always. Sometimes it is clear. It changes, I think. I am not sure. I do not pay very close attention, if that makes sense. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It makes it hard to… work. I work with the drills, you know, for the oil. It needs… focus. And when my head feels full, it is hard to focus. And… I get tired faster. My husband worries about me, too. He says I should come see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Oil drilling, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. It is… hard work. But good work. I have been doing it for… many years. But this sinus… problem is making it harder. It is very dusty where I work, maybe that has something to do with it? I do not know much about… these things.
DOCTOR: Dusty work. Well, no surprise there. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I do not think so. I have never… been told I have allergies. But maybe? Sometimes my eyes itch, and I sneeze a little. But everyone sneezes, right? I am not sure if that is allergies. My mother always said I was a strong girl, and never got sick much. But this… this feels different.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's just have a look at your nose. Open wide. And please, try to remember if anything specifically makes it worse.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, Doctor. I will try. It is hard to remember. Sometimes when it is cold, it feels worse. And maybe… maybe when I am very tired? I am not sure. I will try to pay closer attention.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Nasal passages are… congested, as expected. Some mild swelling of the turbinates. Nothing alarming. And your throat looks… reasonably clear. Lungs sound… fine. Honestly, it sounds like a common cold, probably aggravated by your work environment.
PATIENT: A cold? Oh. Well, that is… good? I mean, not good that I have a cold, but good that it is not… something worse? I was worried it was something serious. Is there… medicine for a cold? Something to help me breathe?
DOCTOR: Decongestants, saline nasal spray, rest. Standard stuff. I can write you a prescription for a decongestant if you like, but honestly, over-the-counter should do the trick. And try to avoid the dust. It's common sense. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Yes, a prescription… maybe that is best? Just to be safe. And… avoiding the dust… yes, I will try. It is hard, but I will ask my supervisor if there is anything I can do. My husband will be glad to hear I am trying. Is there anything else I should do? Any… special things I should eat or drink?
DOCTOR: Hydrate. Fluids. Eat… normally. Avoid strenuous activity until you feel better. Honestly, you're wasting my time with these questions. Here. Take this to the pharmacy. Next patient.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I guess that is all then? Thank you for your help. I will try to… hydrate. And avoid strenuous activity. I hope you have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Next!
