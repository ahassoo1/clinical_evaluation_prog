DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit hard to say exactly. My husband brought me in. He says… my speech hasn’t been quite right lately. I just feel… a little off, I suppose. I don’t really remember when it started, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: I see. It can be difficult to pinpoint when subtle changes occur. That’s quite alright. So, your husband has noticed a difference in your speech. Could you describe what he’s observing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He says I… slur my words sometimes? And that I stumble over them a bit. It doesn’t feel like I’m trying to say anything strange, it just… comes out wrong. It's not all the time, though. Sometimes I feel perfectly normal. It’s very… inconsistent, I guess you could say.
DOCTOR: Inconsistent, you say. That's helpful to know. And how long would you estimate this has been happening, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps… a few weeks? Maybe a month or so? It really is hard to say. My husband would have a better idea, I think. He notices everything. I just… don’t always remember noticing things myself. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal for memory to fluctuate, Ms. Swaby, especially with increasing age. And it's very common for spouses to notice subtle changes we might miss ourselves. A few weeks to a month is a useful timeframe to work with. Now, besides the speech changes, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. I've been feeling a bit… tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. And sometimes… just a little unsteady on my feet. Not falling or anything, but like I could stumble easily. I haven’t mentioned it to my husband, to be honest, because I didn’t think it was anything important. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Swaby, that is certainly relevant. Fatigue and unsteadiness, combined with the changes in speech, are all things we need to explore further. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not really, no. I still do a lot of work with my hands, you see – construction management, so I’m always on-site, checking things, making sure everything’s done properly. I haven’t noticed it being any harder to do my job. It’s just… everything feels a little… off, like I said. Hard to explain. Perhaps it's just the heat, we've been having such warm weather lately.
DOCTOR: The heat can certainly contribute to fatigue, but it's good we're considering other possibilities as well. Now, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I believe I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some medication for that, and it’s been under control, thankfully. And… oh, I had a bit of arthritis in my knees a few years back, but that’s mostly managed with some cream and gentle exercise. Nothing too serious, really. I have Medicare, if that’s important. Does that cover everything? My husband handles most of the insurance details, so I don’t always know.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful information, and we will certainly ensure all services are covered. Thank you for mentioning that. Regarding medications, are you currently taking any other prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Just the medication for the blood pressure… Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take some ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind, nothing prescribed. And… oh, a multivitamin every morning, my daughter always tells me I should. That’s it, I think. Do you need to know anything else? I feel like I’m forgetting something, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful list, Ms. Swaby. It's perfectly alright if things aren’t immediately clear. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult one. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart later in life, I believe. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he had a stroke, years ago. But that’s all I can really remember, to be honest. My family isn't really one for talking about medical things. We just… get on with it, you see. Does that help? I'm terribly sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. Any information is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My husband doesn't approve, and I wouldn’t dream of it. Always been very careful with my health, you see. Well, as careful as I can be, given everything. And… I don't drink much alcohol either. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. Mostly water, to be truthful. I find it keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Swaby, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your neurological function. This will help me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If it will help you figure out what’s wrong, then please, go ahead. Just… please don't rush. I get a little nervous with medical things. And… if it’s going to be uncomfortable, please let me know beforehand. I appreciate a gentle touch, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Swaby. I will explain everything as I go, and we will proceed at your pace. I will also ensure we take breaks if needed. Now, if you could please sit here on the table, we'll start with your vital signs. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Finally, I’d like to check your coordination and balance. Could you please stand and try to touch your nose with your finger, then touch my finger with yours?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit harder than it used to be, isn’t it? I feel a little clumsy, to be truthful. And… my arm feels a bit heavy. Is that normal? I’m terribly sorry, Doctor, I’m not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Swaby. You’re doing perfectly fine. And thank you for letting me know about the difficulty. That’s very important information. I noted some slight difficulty with coordination and balance, and a little weakness in your arms. Now, I'd like to briefly assess your gait, if you’re comfortable with that. Could you please walk a few steps forward and then backward?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s not very graceful, is it? I feel a bit… wobbly. And my legs feel a bit heavy, like they’re dragging. I don’t usually walk like this, Doctor. I’m terribly sorry, I’m making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Swaby. You're not making a mess of anything. It's very helpful for me to observe these changes. I noted some unsteadiness and a slight shuffling gait. Now, I'd like to review the results of the examination. Based on your history and the physical findings – the changes in speech, fatigue, unsteadiness, diminished reflexes, slight weakness, and unsteadiness with gait – I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but these symptoms could be indicative of several possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some further testing. This includes a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. Is it something terribly wrong, Doctor? I mean… is it something… curable? My husband… he’ll be very worried. And… will it be painful? I don’t like enclosed spaces, you see. I get a little… claustrophobic. I really don’t want to worry my husband unnecessarily, but I do want to know what’s going on. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Swaby. It's natural to feel anxious when faced with the possibility of something serious. Let me assure you, ordering these tests doesn't necessarily mean we've arrived at a diagnosis. They are simply a way to gather more information so we can determine the cause of your symptoms and develop the most appropriate treatment plan. The MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique, meaning it doesn’t involve any needles or surgery. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It is generally well-tolerated, but I understand your concern about enclosed spaces. We can discuss options to manage your claustrophobia, such as having a mild sedative or keeping the machine open during the scan. As for what it could be, there are several possibilities. One consideration is a vitamin deficiency, which can sometimes cause neurological symptoms. Another possibility is a minor stroke, although your symptoms don't entirely fit that profile. Rarely, it could be an early sign of a neurodegenerative condition, but it’s far too early to jump to any conclusions. The MRI will help us rule out or confirm these possibilities. I want to be transparent with you, Ms. Swaby. It’s important to consider all possibilities, but it’s equally important to remain optimistic and focus on gathering the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. We will discuss the results of the tests as soon as they are available, and I will answer all of your questions honestly and completely. Now, would you like me to explain the MRI procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me… everything. I need to know what to expect. And… what happens if it is something serious? Will I need… surgery? Or medication? And… will it affect my ability to… live a normal life? I do so much for my family, you see. I run the household, I help my daughter with the children… I don't want to be a burden. I’m terribly sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor, but I’m just… frightened.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Swaby. It’s important you understand everything, and it’s my job to provide you with the information you need. Let’s start with the MRI. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-shaped machine. It's important to remain still during the scan to ensure clear images. You’ll be able to communicate with the technician at all times, and you’ll be given earplugs to reduce the noise. We can also discuss a mild sedative if you're anxious about enclosed spaces. Regarding what happens if it is something serious, it depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it's a vitamin deficiency, treatment is usually straightforward with supplements. If it's a stroke, the treatment plan will depend on the severity and location of the stroke, and may include medication to prevent further clots, rehabilitation therapy, and lifestyle modifications. If, in the unlikely event, it turns out to be a neurodegenerative condition, the treatment options are more complex. However, there are many medications and therapies available to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. We would discuss all of these options in detail, and develop a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. I want to assure you, Ms. Swaby, that even with a serious diagnosis, it’s still possible to live a fulfilling life. Many people with neurological conditions continue to lead active and productive lives. We will work together to manage your condition and ensure you receive the best possible care. Now, I'm going to order the blood work and the MRI. The lab results usually take a few days, and the MRI may take a little longer to schedule. I will call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and… your kindness. It’s just… a lot to take in. I’ll… I’ll try to stay positive. And I’ll let you know if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results.
