DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re forty-one years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. It’s… well, it's a bit embarrassing to discuss, frankly. I have something going on in my mouth. It’s white, and it’s not going away. It’s making it difficult to eat, and my wife… she noticed it, which is never good.
DOCTOR: I understand. While I appreciate your directness, Mr. Schieber, a proper medical assessment requires detail, even with… sensitive issues. “Something going on in your mouth” is rather vague. Could you be more specific about the location of this whiteness?
PATIENT: Honestly? Everywhere. The tongue, the insides of my cheeks… it’s all covered. It looks like… cottage cheese, if that gives you an idea. It's disgusting, really. I've tried rinsing with mouthwash, but it doesn't help. And before you ask, no, I haven’t been… indulging in too much sugar. I maintain a very disciplined diet.
DOCTOR: “Everywhere” is still imprecise, Mr. Schieber, but the “cottage cheese” description is… helpful. Has this appeared suddenly, or has it been developing over time?
PATIENT: It's been a couple of weeks, I'd say. Started small, just a little patch on my tongue, and then it… spread. Like mold. It wasn’t painful at first, but now it’s starting to feel a bit rough, especially when I eat anything acidic. Look, are you going to ask me if I practice good oral hygiene? Because I assure you, I do. This isn’t some… common problem.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Schieber, a thorough medical history is paramount, regardless of one's personal hygiene habits. Let's proceed systematically. Do you recall any recent illnesses, even a minor cold?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Perfectly healthy, as I said. I haven't been sick in years. I take vitamins, eat well, exercise regularly… I lead a very sensible life. This is what happens when you're stressed, I suppose. My business has been… demanding lately. But I don't see how stress causes… this. Honestly, I suspect it’s something… unusual.
DOCTOR: “Unusual” is a subjective term, Mr. Schieber. Very well. Any family history of similar conditions?
PATIENT: No. My family is… robust. My father lived to be ninety, and my mother is still going strong at eighty-five. They’ve never had anything like this. And frankly, neither have I. I'm a practical man, Doctor, and I don’t waste time with frivolous ailments. This feels… serious. I hope we can get to the bottom of it quickly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to poke around too much. It's rather unpleasant. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: I shall be as efficient as possible, Mr. Schieber. Please open wide. Hmmm. The lesions are quite extensive and appear… somewhat adherent. No obvious signs of trauma, though. It appears to be covering a significant portion of your oral mucosa. Your salivary glands don't appear to be swollen, and there’s no noticeable lymphadenopathy.
PATIENT: Adherent? What does that mean? Is it… contagious? My wife and I… well, we share certain intimacies, you understand. And I wouldn't want to…transmit anything. Is this something I should be worried about? Look, just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it serious? I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, please refrain from unnecessary speculation. “Adherent” means the patches are somewhat firmly attached to the underlying tissue. As for contagiousness, based on the initial examination, it doesn’t appear to be a typical infectious process. However, it’s prudent to avoid close contact until we have a definitive diagnosis. Given the extent and persistence of these lesions, and the lack of a clear etiology based on your history, I believe a biopsy is warranted. This will allow us to determine the exact nature of the tissue and guide our treatment plan. It's the most responsible course of action, given your… concerns.
PATIENT: A biopsy? You mean… cutting a piece out of my mouth? Absolutely not. That sounds barbaric. And frankly, quite unnecessary. I’m a businessman, not a… laboratory specimen. Isn't there another way? Some sort of… medication? A stronger mouthwash, perhaps? I’m not going under a knife for this, Doctor. I simply refuse.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, with all due respect, your insistence on avoiding a straightforward diagnostic procedure is… unhelpful. While a stronger mouthwash might provide temporary symptomatic relief, it will not address the underlying cause. And a biopsy is a relatively minor procedure performed in-office under local anesthesia. It’s essential for ruling out more serious conditions, such as lichen planus, oral thrush, or even, in rare cases, premalignant lesions. Frankly, dismissing the possibility of a more serious etiology is… irresponsible. If you refuse a biopsy, I can prescribe an antifungal medication as a trial. However, I must strongly advise you that this is not a definitive treatment and may not resolve the issue. And without a diagnosis, we're simply treating symptoms, not the root cause. Would you prefer I refer you to a specialist?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! But I want it done quickly, and I want minimal discomfort. And I want you to explain everything beforehand, step-by-step. No surprises. I have a very important meeting next week, and I can’t afford to be… incapacitated. Just… get it over with. But I still maintain this is unnecessary. And if it’s just a simple fungal infection, I expect a full refund for this… ordeal.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I will schedule the biopsy for tomorrow afternoon. We will use local anesthesia, and the procedure itself should take approximately fifteen to twenty minutes. I will explain the process in detail before we begin. As for the cost, we will submit the claim to your insurance, if applicable. However, I must reiterate that a definitive diagnosis is crucial. And while I understand your concerns regarding disruption to your schedule, your health takes precedence. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to local anesthetics?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. But I do have a rather low pain tolerance. So, please, be gentle. And… if it bleeds a lot, just tell me. I don’t faint, but… I dislike surprises. And honestly, Doctor, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. But fine, let’s get it over with. Just… try not to keep me waiting. My time is valuable. And please, ensure your staff understands the importance of punctuality.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I will inform my staff to prioritize your appointment. I assure you, we will proceed with all due diligence and minimal discomfort. Please sign this consent form, confirming your understanding of the procedure and associated risks. We will see you tomorrow at 2 PM. Do you have any further questions before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get it over with. And try not to poke around too much. Good day, Doctor.
