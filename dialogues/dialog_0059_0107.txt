DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Umm... my heart. It feels... fast sometimes. Not always, but when it happens, it's like a bird flapping inside. It worries my wife. That's why I come.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Puder. It’s good that you’re here and that your wife is encouraging you to seek medical attention. Palpitations can be concerning, and it’s wise to get them checked out. When you say “fast,” could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Okay. Not like running fast, you know? More... shaky. And regular, but too fast. Like... thump-thump, thump-thump, thump-thump... really quick. It lasts a few minutes, maybe. Then it goes away. It happened three times last week, I think. I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Puder. "Shaky" and "too fast" are helpful descriptions. And the regularity is good to know. Three times last week… that's useful information. Do these episodes happen when you’re resting, or are you active when they occur?
PATIENT: Hmm... mostly when I rest. Like... after I eat dinner. Or before I go to sleep. Sometimes when I watch TV. I don't think it happened when I work. I work with... machines, you know? Big machines. Lots of walking, but not... running.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily at rest, particularly after meals or before sleep. And it doesn't seem to be related to physical exertion at work. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything else happening when these palpitations occur?
PATIENT: No... not really. I feel... a little weak, maybe? But that could be just because my heart is beating so fast. I don't get dizzy. No pain. No... sweating or anything. Just the fast beating. My wife says I look a little pale, but I don't know if I notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness, chest pain, or sweating – that's reassuring. A little weakness is understandable with a rapid heart rate, and we can certainly investigate that further. Now, let's go over some general health questions. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I never been sick much. Maybe a cold sometimes. When I was little, I had... the measles, I think. But that was a long time ago. My wife, she has... a little bit of high blood pressure, but I don't.
DOCTOR: Good to know you haven't had any significant medical issues in the past, Mr. Puder. And thank you for mentioning your wife's history; that's helpful context. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. No hospital. I break my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that's it. Just a cast.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good. Now, regarding your family history – are there any heart problems, sudden unexplained deaths, or arrhythmias – irregular heartbeats – in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... My father, he had... something with his heart, when he was old. He was very tired a lot. But I don't know what it was. He died when I was young. My mother, she was okay. No heart problems.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Puder. It's common to not have a complete understanding of family medical history. Knowing your father had heart issues, even without specifics, is helpful. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. I drink... sometimes. Maybe one or two beers with dinner on the weekend. Not every weekend. And no drugs. Never. I don't like them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or drug use, and only occasional alcohol. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just... water. I drink lots of water. My wife, she takes some pills for her blood pressure, but not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything. I go outside in the sun. I'm okay. My wife is allergic to cats, but I like cats.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Puder, to get a better understanding of what might be causing these palpitations, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you think is best. My wife says I need to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. When listening to your heart, I do not hear any murmurs, rubs, or extra sounds. Your lungs sound clear. I'm also palpating your thyroid and don't feel any enlargement. I'm going to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to record your heart's electrical activity. We should also check your blood levels of potassium, magnesium, and thyroid stimulating hormone. I'd also like to check your complete blood count. Do you have any concerns about these tests?
PATIENT: Okay... tests. That's okay. I trust you, Doctor. Blood... I don't like needles, but I can do it. What do the tests show? What are you looking for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Puder – many people aren't fond of needles. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. The EKG will help us see if there are any irregularities in your heart's rhythm or any signs of previous heart problems. The blood tests will help us rule out any electrolyte imbalances or thyroid issues that could be contributing to your palpitations. While we await the results, I want to assure you that palpitations can often be benign. However, it's important to investigate them to rule out any underlying causes. It’s also possible that you’re experiencing premature atrial contractions, or PACs, which are extra beats that don’t usually cause any harm. We’ll see what the tests show and go from there. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay... premature... what did you say? Is that bad? I don’t understand all the words. And how long for the tests? Can I still work?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Puder. It’s completely normal to feel worried when you don’t understand medical terms. Premature atrial contractions, or PACs, are extra heartbeats that originate in the upper chambers of your heart. They often feel like a skipped beat or a fluttering sensation. In most cases, they’re harmless and don’t require any treatment. However, we want to confirm this with the tests. The blood tests and EKG should be completed within the hour. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Yes, you can absolutely still go to work. There's no reason to avoid your usual activities while we await the results. However, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that clarify things a bit for you?
PATIENT: Okay... 24-48 hours. Not too bad. And work is okay. That's good. No chest pain, dizziness... I remember. Thank you, Doctor. You explain it very well.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, try to keep a log of when you experience these palpitations – note the time, what you were doing, and any associated symptoms. This information can be helpful when we review the results. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. I just want to go home and rest. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I'm glad I could help. I’ll have the nurse come in to get started. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before we hear back with the results.
