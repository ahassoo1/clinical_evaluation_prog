DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. It is about… the words. They do not come so easy now. It is… difficult to find them. I forget… what I want to say, sometimes. It is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Words not coming so easy.” Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And this has been happening… how long, exactly?
PATIENT: How long… that is… a good question. Not… recently, recently. But… a while. Perhaps… six months? Maybe longer. It is hard to say, truthfully. My memory… it is not what it was. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Six months… alright. And would you say it’s gradual, this difficulty, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Yes… gradual. Not… one day, poof, gone. It… slowly became harder. Little by little. I would… stumble over words, then… more and more. Now it is… like trying to catch smoke. It is there, but… you cannot hold it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Gyamfi, although I must say, metaphors aren't always the most precise way to describe medical symptoms. Now, are these difficulties with finding words constant, or do they come and go throughout the day?
PATIENT: Ah… yes, precise. I understand. They… come and go. Some days are… better. Some days, very bad. In the morning, usually… a little easier. But… as the day goes on… they get harder. And… when I am tired… much, much harder. It is… exhausting, to try and find the right words. I try to… slow down, but it does not always help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this difficulty limited to finding words, or are you having trouble understanding what people say to you as well?
PATIENT: Understanding… hmm. No, not so much. People… I can hear them. I understand what they say, usually. It is… saying what I mean that is the problem. Like… the thought is there, but the words… they hide. They do not come forward. It is very… strange. I do not know how to explain it better.
DOCTOR: Well, it sounds… frustrating, certainly. We'll need to rule out a few things. Now, have you had any recent head injuries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No head injuries. Not recently, or… ever, that I remember. I am… careful. I do not… fall, or anything like that. I was always… a steady man. My wife… she used to say I was too careful, even. She is… gone now, though. But no, no injuries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. No… not that I am aware of. I wear glasses, you see. Have for many years. The doctor… the eye doctor… checks them every year. Last check… everything was fine. I do not… see any differently. Things are… blurry without the glasses, of course. But… that is normal. No changes, no.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions - high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes… I do. I have… the blood pressure. High, the doctor says. I take the pills… every day. For many years. And… my wife… she had the diabetes. I do not… have it myself, but… sometimes I worry. I have… Medicare, you see. They check me… regularly. But… the blood pressure, yes. That is… the one thing. Is that… bad? For the words?
DOCTOR: It can be a contributing factor, Mr. Gyamfi. High blood pressure, if poorly controlled, can affect blood flow to the brain. Do you know what your most recent blood pressure reading was?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. I… I do not know. The doctor… she tells me. But I do not… remember the numbers. I try to… take the pills, like she says. Every day. But… the numbers? No. I am sorry, Doctor. I am not very good with… numbers. Is it… very high? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We can check your records. Now, have you had any strokes or transient ischemic attacks – what they call “mini-strokes” – in the past?
PATIENT: Strokes? No! No, I have not had a stroke. Oh, dear, no! My wife… she had a stroke, many years ago. It was… very bad. But I have not had one. I would… know if I had a stroke, would I not? I feel… everything is working. My arms, my legs… everything. No, Doctor, no strokes. That is… a very frightening thought.
DOCTOR: Yes, you would likely know. Alright. Now, let’s move on to medications. Besides your blood pressure medication, are you taking anything else – over-the-counter drugs, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Just the pills for the blood pressure. And… sometimes, for my knee. It aches, you see. Sometimes I take… the ibuprofen. The white pills. Over-the-counter, I think. Not… a prescription. Just when it hurts. And… sometimes, a little vitamin D. The doctor… she said I was low. But… that is all. Just the blood pressure pills, the ibuprofen, and the vitamin D. Nothing else. I try to… keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No alcohol. Not at all. My wife… she did not like it. And… I do not care for it myself. Never have. Just… water, mostly. And… sometimes, tea. But no alcohol. Not a drop. I do not… drink. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Gyamfi, it’s not a problem. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No! Never. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife… she did, for a time, when she was young. But I… I always said no. A terrible habit. No, Doctor, never smoked. Not a single one. I am glad. It is… good to be healthy, is it not?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. Now, I think it's time for a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I am… a little unsteady, sometimes. Old age, you see. But I can stand. Just… be careful, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes seem… normal. Strength is adequate, though a bit diminished. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I can feel that. A little… tingling, perhaps? But I can feel your touch. Here… and here. Is that… normal? It is… a strange sensation. Not painful, just… different. Like pins and needles, a little.
DOCTOR: Repeat after me: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”
PATIENT: “The… the quick… brown… fox… jumps… over… the… lazy… dog.” It is… harder than it looks. I… I had to think about each word. It did not come easily. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to check your gait. Can you walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am… a little unsteady, as I said. Old age, you see. And… my knee. It aches sometimes. I try to… be careful. Is that… alright? Am I doing it correctly?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's enough. It seems we have enough information for now. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing early signs of cognitive decline. It’s likely not anything dramatic at this stage, but we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? What… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Am I… losing my mind? My wife… she had… problems, later in life. Is that… what this is? Please, tell me. What is happening to me?
DOCTOR: Now, now, Mr. Gyamfi, don’t panic. “Cognitive decline” is a broad term. It simply means that some of your cognitive functions – memory, thinking, language – aren’t working as well as they used to. It could be due to a number of factors – age, high blood pressure, even vitamin deficiencies. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “losing your mind,” as you put it. We need to rule out other causes first. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other basic markers. I also want you to get a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to rule out any structural problems. Finally, I’d like you to see a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – for a more thorough evaluation. I’m also going to recommend a cognitive assessment – a series of tests to measure your memory and thinking skills. This is just to get a baseline, Mr. Gyamfi. Don’t worry, it’s a fairly straightforward process. Here’s the referral for the neurologist and the requisition form for the blood tests. I’ll have the nurse schedule your scan.
