DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Pitmon, was it? Yes, well, it’s about this…letter. For a pet. Honestly, the whole thing is just a bit silly, if you ask me. People and their animals… It's for my niece, actually. She's moving, you see, and they need a letter saying I approve of her having one. Something about the landlord? I don’t really follow these things.
DOCTOR: A letter…for a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A letter! Saying I think she’s…responsible enough. It’s rather ridiculous, isn’t it? She’s a grown woman, perfectly capable of looking after a little…fluffy thing. But apparently, they need official paperwork these days for everything. Honestly, the world is going mad. I just need you to…sign something, I suppose? If you can. I don’t even know what they expect me to say in it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, this isn't exactly within the scope of a medical practice. I’m a physician, I provide healthcare... not character references for pet ownership. I'm afraid I can't simply sign something like that. It sets a rather…unprofessional precedent, and frankly, it's not what I trained to do. Do you have any actual medical concerns today?
PATIENT: Well, excuse me? I came here on the recommendation of a friend, who said you were… accommodating. I specifically asked if you did these kinds of letters! And now you’re telling me it’s “unprofessional”? Honestly, it’s a simple signature. A few words about responsibility. It’s not like I’m asking you to perform surgery on a hamster. It's just… frankly, I don't have time for this. Are you sure you're a doctor? This is the sort of thing a helpful person would do. It's just a small favor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am a doctor, and a rather good one, I might add. And my time is valuable. I’m trained to diagnose and treat illness, not to validate someone’s ability to care for a pet. It's a matter of professional ethics and appropriate use of medical resources. You mentioned a friend recommended me… perhaps they were misinformed about the services I provide. I can, however, offer you a referral to a notary public who can assist with your document. Or, with all due respect, I suggest you find another professional more suited to your needs. Is there anything medical I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. A notary? Really? It’s just a letter! And I suppose I could list something… just to get this over with. A little back pain, perhaps? It’s been acting up. Though it’s nothing serious. Just…old age, I suppose. Can you write something about that? Something generic, so I can get this letter signed? It’s just…a lot of hassle, and frankly, I don’t have the energy for a proper examination.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I find this increasingly… problematic. You are asking me to fabricate a medical complaint to justify a letter for a pet. That is unethical and potentially illegal. However… ...if you are experiencing back pain, I can document that. But it will be a truthful account of your symptoms, as you describe them, and it won't be a detailed assessment. And it will not be contingent on getting this letter signed. It will be a medical record, nothing more. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, “fabricate”? Such a strong word. It’s just… embellishing a little. It’s not like I’m claiming a broken spine. A little discomfort, a bit of stiffness… perfectly reasonable. Yes, yes, document the discomfort. That’s all I ask. Perfectly reasonable. Just…make it sound…official. And preferably, something that would imply responsibility. You know, taking care of oneself, being able to manage one’s health… things like that. Is that so much to ask? Honestly, doctors these days…
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am not going to “embellish” or fabricate any medical information for your convenience. I will document what you tell me about your back pain, objectively and truthfully. I will not add any language implying responsibility or suitability for pet ownership. It’s a breach of medical ethics, and I will not compromise my professional integrity. Now, if you can describe your back pain – location, severity, what makes it better or worse – I will document it. Otherwise, I suggest you seek medical attention elsewhere, or consult a legal professional regarding your letter.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. Such a fuss over nothing. It's… lower back, mostly. A bit achy, especially after sitting for too long. Standing helps, walking around. Lifting… well, I try to avoid lifting heavy things. Honestly, it’s probably just old age catching up with me. Really, it's nothing to write a novel about. Just…document that it’s there. And perhaps add something about me being… generally capable? Is that too much to ask? It’s for my niece’s peace of mind, you see. She worries too much. .
