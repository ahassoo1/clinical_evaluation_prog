DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning to you too, Doctor. Right, well… it's my head, mostly. I keep gettin’ these… bad headaches. And I get really sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda races, you know? It’s… unsettling. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like it’s been a while though.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, sweating, and a racing heart. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a while, but you’re not sure exactly when it started. That’s alright, we can try to narrow it down. First, let's talk about the headaches themselves. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe the pain… right. It’s… it’s not like a normal headache, if that makes sense? It’s… throbbing, I guess. And it’s usually on both sides of my head, kinda feels like a band is squeezin’ it really tight. Sometimes it’s just at the front, though. It’s hard to explain. It feels… awful, obviously. Does that… help? I don’t know much about headaches, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that helps, actually. Throbbing pain on both sides, sometimes just at the front, like a tight band… and you said it’s quite severe. Okay. And how long do these headaches typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That’s a good question. I… I don’t really keep track of time when I’ve got one, to be honest. It feels like hours, definitely. Maybe a few hours, maybe longer? It’s hard to say. It kinda just… fades away eventually. I usually just try to sleep it off, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, several hours, and you tend to sleep it off. Do anything specific trigger these headaches, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: Trigger? Not that I've noticed, really. I mean, work's pretty stressful sometimes, bein’ on my feet all day… but I’ve been doin’ that job for a while now. It doesn’t always bring one on. Sometimes it happens when I’m just relaxin’ at home, watchin’ TV or somethin’. I honestly don’t see a pattern, if there even is one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no obvious triggers. Let's talk about those other symptoms - the sweating and the racing heart. Do they happen with every headache, or only sometimes?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, they always happen with it. Like, whenever my head starts hurtin’ bad, I start gettin’ all sweaty and my heart starts thumpin’ like I’ve just run a marathon. It’s… scary, to be honest. It makes me feel really weak, and kinda dizzy sometimes. That's why I figured I should probably get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sweating and racing heart consistently accompany the headaches, and they cause weakness and dizziness. That’s important information. Have you noticed any changes in your vision during these episodes – like blurred vision, spots, or flashing lights?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe? I get these… kinda wavy lines sometimes, when the headache's really bad. It’s not all the time, and it doesn’t last long, but yeah, I think I do see some weird stuff with my eyes. It’s hard to explain, it’s just… like lookin’ through water, maybe? I always figured it was just from strainin’ my eyes, lookin’ at things all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, wavy lines, like looking through water, during the headaches. Noted. Have you ever had a headache like this before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. I’ve had headaches before, plenty of them. But… not like this. Not with the sweaty palms and the racing heart and the wavy vision. This feels different. It started… well, I still can’t really say when, but it definitely wasn't somethin’ I used to get. It’s… more intense, I guess. Worryin’, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, this feels different and more intense than headaches you’ve experienced in the past. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I’ve always been pretty healthy, or so I thought. I mean, I’ve had colds and the flu, like everyone else, but nothin’ serious. I don’t take any regular medication, either. I got divorced a couple years back and… well, health insurance was the last thing on my mind then.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and no regular medications. Divorced two years ago, and without insurance since then. That’s good to know. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… That's a good question. My mum had headaches sometimes, but just normal ones, she said. Nothing like this. My dad… he had a bad heart, but that wasn't headaches. I don't really know much about my grandparents' health, to be honest. We weren't very close. Sorry, I'm not much help on that one. I don't really keep track of that kinda thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no strong family history of similar issues. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never really been much of a smoker. I'll have a beer with friends sometimes, maybe a couple on a weekend, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested. I try to stay pretty clean, honestly. Just tryin’ to get by.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. Alright, Jaxston, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I need to, to figure out what’s goin’ on with my head. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes and coordination. It shouldn’t take long. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 145/90. That could be from the anxiety of being here, or it could be something else. I'll repeat it later. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. And lungs are clear. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head.
PATIENT: Okay, follow your finger… Right. I'm tryin'. Is that okay? It feels kinda… weird, keepin' my head so still.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re doing fine. It is a little strange. Okay, good. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and tell me if you can feel anything when I touch your face. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel that. Yeah, I can feel it. Is it supposed to feel… different?
DOCTOR: No, that's good. It should feel normal. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you keep your legs relaxed?
PATIENT: Yeah, relaxed. Did I do okay? It kinda startled me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's normal to have a reaction. Okay. Your reflexes are a little more active than I’d like to see. Now, finally, I’m going to listen to the blood flow in your neck. Okay, Jaxston, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, your symptoms – the headaches, sweating, racing heart, wavy vision, and elevated blood pressure and reflexes – are concerning. I'm not going to jump to a diagnosis right now, but I want to rule out a few possibilities. I want to get some blood work done, and I think a CT scan of your brain would be a good idea. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Wow, that sounds… serious. Is it somethin’ really bad? Blood work, I can handle, sure. But a scan… I don't know. What are you lookin' for, exactly? I mean, I just thought it was bad headaches.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jaxston. It does sound serious, and I apologize for alarming you. A CT scan is just a precaution. It allows us to get a clear picture of your brain to rule out any structural problems – like an aneurysm, a bleed, or a tumor. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer. The blood work will help us check your overall health, rule out any infections, and assess your electrolyte levels, which can sometimes contribute to headaches. I want to be thorough and make sure we identify the cause of your symptoms. It’s possible it’s something relatively minor, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood work and CT scan?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. Okay… if you think it’s necessary… then yeah, do whatever you think is best. I just… I don’t really like bein’ poked and prodded, if I’m honest. And a scan sounds… scary. But I guess it’s better to know, right? So, yeah, blood work and the scan. Just… tell me what to expect, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything step-by-step. For the blood work, a phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and you might feel a slight pinch. For the CT scan, you will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s completely painless, and you won’t feel anything. The machine takes a series of X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. It will take about 15-20 minutes. We will give you instructions on what to wear and if you need to remove any jewelry. I’ll also need to ask you a few more detailed questions about your symptoms while we wait for the results. Have you noticed anything that makes the headaches worse, like stress, certain foods, or changes in the weather?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… Stress, yeah, definitely. Work gets really busy sometimes, and that always seems to make it worse. And… bright lights, maybe? I get a really bad headache sometimes if I'm out in the sun too long. And… sometimes if I skip a meal, I think. I'm not really good at eatin' regular, if I'm honest. Just kinda grab whatever's easiest. But I don't know if that's it, really. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress, bright lights, and skipping meals can potentially worsen the headaches. That’s helpful information. Now, just one more question. Have you experienced any recent changes in your vision – like double vision, blurred vision that doesn’t go away, or loss of vision in one eye?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the wavy lines during the headache. My vision's been normal otherwise, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses, but my prescription hasn’t changed in a while. I had my eyes checked a couple years ago, and everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's helpful to know. Alright, Jaxston, I’m going to order the blood work and the CT scan now. The phlebotomist will come in shortly to draw your blood. I'll also have the radiology department schedule the CT scan for you. In the meantime, I want you to try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. If your headache becomes severe or you experience any new symptoms – like fever, stiff neck, weakness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything. Just… try to rest, avoid stress… and watch out for bad stuff. Right. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen. Hopefully, it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to let me or my staff know if you have any concerns or questions along the way. The phlebotomist should be here any moment now. I’ll check back with you after the blood work and once the radiology department has scheduled your CT scan. For now, just try to relax. We'll take it one step at a time. .
PATIENT: .
