DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's about my…well, my stool. It’s black. Like really black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis, all the time. I’ve been taking them for years. Is that what’s doing it? I just want to know if it’s serious, because I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Dawnetta. Black stool, or melena as we call it, can certainly be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. You mentioned the pain pills for your arthritis – those are important to know about. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about the stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you want to know about it? It’s…dark. Sticky, I suppose. And it smells…well, like stool. What else is there to say? It’s not diarrhea, if that’s what you’re getting at. It’s…formed. Mostly. Look, I’m not a doctor, I just know it’s not right. And I take Ibuprofen, a lot of it. Every day. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dawnetta, that’s helpful. Sticky and formed, not diarrhea… that’s good to know. And yes, you’re right to mention the Ibuprofen; that’s very important. The fact that it’s consistently dark is what we need to investigate further. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well, I’m seventy-three years old, things change. What do you expect? I mean, I don't go as often as I used to, naturally. And sometimes it’s harder to…pass. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Honestly, I don’t spend my days examining my…output. I have better things to do. Is this going to take long? My husband is expecting me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dawnetta, and I certainly don’t expect you to spend your days analyzing things. It’s perfectly normal for things to change with age, and you’re right, that’s important context. To clarify, when you say not as often, about how many times a week are you typically having a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Maybe…three times a week? Sometimes less. It varies. And like I said, it’s not always easy. I don’t want to get into details, but sometimes I have to…strain. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m even telling you all this. It’s embarrassing. And it’s probably just the Ibuprofen. I bet it is. Everyone takes Ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Dawnetta, and you're doing the right thing by sharing this information with me. It’s all very helpful. And you’re right, many people take Ibuprofen, but it can sometimes cause issues like this, and we need to rule out other possibilities as well. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any blood in your stool, even if it’s just a small amount?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. I would know if there was blood. That would be serious. I haven’t seen any blood. Not a drop. I told you, it’s just black. Like…tar. And it’s probably the pills. It has to be the pills. I’ve been taking them for years! Are you going to give me a lecture about taking too much Ibuprofen? My doctor back home always said it was fine. He was a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dawnetta, and I assure you, I'm not here to lecture you. It's good to hear you haven't noticed any visible blood. And it's helpful to know your previous doctor felt the Ibuprofen was acceptable. To be thorough, and to help determine the cause of the black stool, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking for any signs of tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. A physical exam? Really? I came in here about my stool, not for a full check-up. Look, I’m a busy woman. My husband is waiting. I suppose if it will get me out of here faster…fine. But don’t poke and prod too much. And be gentle. I have sensitive skin. Honestly, I don’t see what good it will do, but if it’s what you need to do… go ahead. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Dawnetta. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and it won’t take long. I’m just listening to your abdomen to see if everything sounds normal. Please lie back on the examination table when you’re ready. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline, then I’ll focus on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Breathe normally for me, Dawnetta. Everything sounds clear so far, but I’m going to gently press on your abdomen now to check for any tenderness. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort in any particular spot.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is ridiculous. Poking and prodding an old woman. I can feel everything. And it’s cold! Is this necessary? I’m telling you, it’s just the pills. I’ve been taking them for years! And my husband is going to be furious if I’m much longer. He made me a roast. A roast. It’ll be ruined if I’m not home soon. Just get it over with. And be careful! I bruise easily, you know. Honestly, doctors these days… all poking and prodding. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta, and I apologize for any discomfort. I’m being as gentle as possible, and I’m only doing this to rule out any other possible causes for the black stool. I’m not finding any significant tenderness at this time, which is good. Your abdomen sounds normal, but I’ll just check one more thing. I’m going to gently press on this area now. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts! Right there, on the left side. It’s a dull ache, but it’s definitely there. See? I told you something was wrong! It's probably my colon. My mother had problems with her colon. This is what I get for taking those pills all these years. Honestly, I should have known better. Just…stop poking around. It’s making it worse. And get me a blanket! I’m freezing. This is a terrible experience. Truly terrible. My husband is going to hear about this, you know. He warned me about coming to a new doctor. He said they always poke and prod. He was right. Absolutely right.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the pain, Dawnetta. I didn't mean to cause you any discomfort. The fact that you're experiencing pain in that area is significant, and it's good you pointed it out. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms, the black stool, and the pain in your left side, I'd like to order some blood work to check your complete blood count and liver function. I also recommend a stool test to check for blood and any signs of infection. And, to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your colon, I think a colonoscopy is the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Are you serious? No! Absolutely not! I’m not sticking anything up there! That sounds dreadful. I’ve heard stories… it’s invasive and uncomfortable and… and just no! I came in here about my stool, not for a full-blown medical procedure! Blood work, fine. A stool test, maybe. But no colonoscopy! Absolutely not! I'm seventy-three years old! I don't need all those tests! It's probably just the pills! I keep telling you! This is ridiculous. I want a second opinion. And I want to go home. Now. My husband is waiting. And the roast is getting cold. Honestly, this has been the worst experience of my life. I’m going to tell my husband everything. He was right about coming here. Absolutely right. .
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Dawnetta, and I respect your decision. I certainly wouldn't want to proceed with anything you're not comfortable with. However, given your symptoms and the pain you're experiencing, I strongly recommend you discuss this further with another physician. A colonoscopy is the most effective way to rule out any serious underlying causes. I can provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist in the area, and I’m happy to share the results of the blood work and stool test with them. In the meantime, I'll order the blood work and stool test as we discussed. And please, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting – please go to the emergency room immediately. Here is the referral information. I apologize again for any discomfort or stress I’ve caused you today. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find the answers you’re looking for.
