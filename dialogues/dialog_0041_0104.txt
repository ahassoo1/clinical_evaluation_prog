DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor...Polczynski, is it? My throat. It hurts. Been hurting for...a bit. I don't really have time for this, if we're being honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. A sore throat, got it. And you said it's been hurting for a bit… can you tell me a little more about that "bit"?
PATIENT: Honestly? I can't recall exactly. A few days, maybe? It's just...a pain. A dull ache. I work with…machines. Big, loud machines. Perhaps it’s from yelling over the noise? Though, I doubt it. It's probably nothing serious. I just need something to make it stop hurting, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of a dull ache. And you work with loud machines, so there’s a possibility it’s related to straining your voice. I understand you’d like something for the pain quickly, and we'll definitely get to that. Let me just pull up your record here… Tammie Ottaviani, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, I haven't been to a doctor in…years. Not since my husband…well. It doesn't matter. Just please, let's not spend all day on paperwork. I have shifts. And I really don't enjoy being sick. It slows everything down.
DOCTOR: I understand. No need to worry about a long history today, we'll focus on getting your throat feeling better. Okay, I see you haven't been in for a while. Just to be thorough, and to help me understand what's going on, could you tell me if you have any other symptoms besides the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I feel…tired, I suppose. Working long hours does that to a person. And maybe a little…off. But honestly, Doctor, everyone feels "off" sometimes. Is this necessary? I thought we were here to fix the pain, not list every minor discomfort I've experienced.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, and I apologize if I'm taking too long. It is about getting to the pain, but other symptoms can help me understand why it’s there. "A little off" is good to know. Are you having any fever, chills, cough, runny nose, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Definitely not. I don’t get sick like that. A cough…sometimes, when the dust is bad at the factory. Runny nose…no. And difficulty swallowing…well, it's a little uncomfortable, yes. But nothing a strong lozenge couldn’t fix. I just want something strong, Doctor. And quickly. This is really wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, mostly just a little discomfort swallowing and a bit of a cough when the dust is bad. Alright. Let's just take a quick look at your throat, okay?
PATIENT: If you must. But be quick about it. I don’t like having things poked at. And please, don’t tell me it's just a "virus". I know my own body, and it’s not that. Probably just irritated. From the yelling. Or the dust. Or…something. Just hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, open wide and say "ahhh." ... Alright. Hmm… your throat is a little red, and I see some slight swelling of your tonsils. No visible pus or anything concerning, but it is inflamed. Let's listen to your lungs quickly, just to rule anything out.
PATIENT: Inflamed? See? I told you. It’s irritation. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I work in a factory! Of course my throat is irritated. Are you going to give me something or not? Because I really don't have time for a full examination. I have a shift starting soon. And I expect you to be efficient.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. Okay. Your lungs are good, which is reassuring. It does sound like irritation, as you suspect. However, even irritation can sometimes lead to a secondary infection. To be on the safe side, and because you haven’t been to a doctor in a while, I'd like to do a quick strep test, just to rule that out. It’s a simple swab, won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Absolutely not. I don't like things being poked around in my throat. I've already told you it’s irritation. This is ridiculous. I'm a grown woman. I know what’s wrong with me. Just give me something for the pain and let me go. I don't have time for tests and procedures. This is a waste of my valuable time. Honestly. I’m starting to regret coming here. Just…the pain. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I respect your feeling that you know your body. However, strep throat can sometimes present with very mild symptoms, and it's important to rule it out to prevent complications. If it is bacterial, it needs antibiotics. Since you are adamant about not wanting a swab, and you are otherwise well, I will prescribe a course of a soothing throat lozenge with benzocaine, and recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen as needed. However, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, have difficulty breathing, or can’t swallow – please seek immediate medical attention. This is important, Tammie. It’s always better to be cautious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Lozenge. Pain relievers. Just…get it done. I need to get back to work. And don't expect me to come back if it doesn't work. This has been…a thoroughly unpleasant experience. I should have just dealt with it myself. .
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm prescribing a strong benzocaine lozenge, to be used as directed on the packaging. And over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain relief, if needed. Here you go. And please, if things get worse, don't hesitate to seek care. It was nice meeting you, Tammie, and I hope you feel better soon. Take care. .
