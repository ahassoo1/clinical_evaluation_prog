DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, good to meet you. I see you're 85 years young. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it’s about this… discoloration. My skin, you see. It’s darkening. And frankly, I’m terribly fatigued. It’s quite bothersome, and I haven’t the time for these sorts of things. I'm a busy man, even at my age. Let’s get this sorted quickly, shall we?
DOCTOR: Discoloration and fatigue, alright. And you say it’s…new?
PATIENT: New? Honestly, Doctor, I can scarcely recall. Things…blur. It’s been happening for a while, I suppose. A few months, perhaps? It's difficult to say precisely. I work with iron, reinforcing bars…very physical work, you understand. Perhaps it’s that. Though I’ve been doing that for decades. It's probably nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right. And where exactly are you noticing this discoloration?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Really. Mostly on my arms, I think. And my face feels…dull. Not vibrant, you understand. Though I assure you, I used to have quite the complexion. Not that it matters now. It's just…unsettling. Are you going to examine me, or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. A quick examination will be helpful. If you don’t mind, if you could roll up your sleeves, and we'll take a look at your arms. Then, we’ll have a look at your face. Just so I can get a better understanding of what’s going on. It's standard procedure, you know.
PATIENT: Procedure, procedure… Honestly. Very well. But do hurry. I have things to oversee. And please be gentle. My skin is rather…delicate, you see. Though I’ve handled rougher materials in my time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see some hyperpigmentation here. And the skin does feel a bit thin. No obvious lesions, no swelling. Do you notice any itching, burning, or pain in these areas?
PATIENT: Itching? Good heavens, no. I wouldn’t tolerate itching. A bit of…tiredness, perhaps. A general malaise. But no, no itching. As for burning…well, everything burns eventually, doesn’t it? Life itself is a burning sensation. But not specifically here. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t have time for frivolous sensations.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some similar discoloration on your face, along with some… age spots, as expected. Any history of excessive sun exposure, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Sun exposure? Doctor, I’ve worked outdoors for the better part of my life! Reinforcing iron doesn’t happen in a darkened room, you know. Of course, there’s been sun exposure! I'm not a recluse. Though I prefer sensible clothing, I assure you. Long sleeves, a wide-brimmed hat… precautions were always taken. I’m not a fool. Though, frankly, I don’t recall precisely how much sun I’ve had. It's been many years. Do you need a detailed account of my entire life?
DOCTOR: No, no detailed account needed. Just trying to gather information. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, as I mentioned, fatigue. A general feeling of… depletion. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Though, frankly, the food these days… it lacks substance. But I don’t go around complaining. That’s hardly a symptom, is it? Just the natural decline of age, I suspect. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to wonder if this visit was necessary. Are you going to tell me something useful, or just continue asking questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll run a few basic blood tests, Mr. Drahota. To check your iron levels, kidney function, liver function, and a complete blood count. Just to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and discoloration. It's a standard procedure, and it will help me get a clearer picture of what's going on. It will also help to rule out any deficiencies. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More poking and prodding. Very well. As long as it doesn't take all day. And I expect a clear explanation of the results. No jargon, Doctor. I'm a practical man, not a medical student. And if it's nothing serious, I trust you won’t keep me here unnecessarily. Now, let’s get this over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take care of the blood draw. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. Once that’s done, you can come back, and we'll discuss the next steps. I will, of course, explain the results in plain language, Mr. Drahota. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to.
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes, you say? Very well. But I expect efficiency. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, no unnecessary questions from your…phlebotomist. I've already answered quite enough for one day.
