DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t much time for this. It’s… well, my skin. It’s darkening. And I tire easily. It’s quite bothersome, really. I’ve been… working, of course. Always working. But it seems worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and increased fatigue. We’ll certainly look into that. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the skin darkening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? That’s… difficult to say. It’s been gradual, you see. A little here, a little there. Years, perhaps? I don’t concern myself with such trivialities. It’s the doing that matters, not when something began to… fade. Is this really necessary? It's just a bit of colour, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota, and I appreciate you coming in despite that. Even small changes can sometimes indicate something important, and it's my job to rule things out. “A bit of colour” can be caused by many things, some of which we want to address. If pinpointing a specific time is difficult, that's alright. Has it been getting worse recently – noticeably darker or spreading to new areas?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, it has been getting worse. On my hands, mostly. And… well, my face, I suppose. Though I don’t spend much time looking at myself. A working man doesn’t have time for vanity. It’s not spreading, not exactly. Just… deepening. A muddier shade, if you must know. Honestly, the fatigue is the greater concern. I used to be able to work all day, now… I need a rest after a few hours. It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so darkening on your hands and face, and increasing fatigue. And the fatigue is more recent and impacting your ability to work. I appreciate you clarifying that. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about where you typically work?
PATIENT: Reinforcing iron. Rebar. Construction sites, naturally. I’ve been doing it for… a very long time. Decades. It’s honest work. Though, these days, the young men aren't built like they used to be. All soft hands and complaining. It's dusty work, of course. And hot. Very hot. Is that relevant? Because I assure you, I take all necessary precautions. As much as one can on a construction site.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very relevant, Mr. Drahota. Working with iron and being exposed to dust and heat gives me some initial ideas. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the darkening and fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No… not particularly. Perhaps a bit of aching in my joints, but that’s to be expected at my age. A working man accumulates wear and tear, you understand. And… sometimes my appetite isn’t what it used to be. But I put that down to the heat. It’s hard to eat much when it's sweltering. Really, I’m not one for complaining about minor discomforts. What does any of this matter, Doctor? Are you going to find some ailment I haven't already lived with for years?
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Drahota. We're not necessarily looking for a new ailment, but rather trying to understand why you're experiencing these changes. Joint aches and decreased appetite are helpful pieces of information. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you suggesting… something untoward? I assure you, my digestive system is perfectly… functional. And weight loss? I may have lost a little, but that’s hardly unexpected. I’m not a young man anymore! And frankly, I find these questions… intrusive. I came here because my skin is darkening and I’m tired. Let's focus on that, shall we? I have work to get back to. Is there something you can do about it, or are we simply going to catalogue my declining years?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to be concerned about the focus, Mr. Drahota, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It's simply my job to rule out anything serious. We will focus on the skin darkening and fatigue. Given your profession and the symptoms you’ve described, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’d like to check your skin more closely, listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps check your joints. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with then. But be quick about it. I haven't got all day, you know. And please, try not to poke too much. I’m a working man, not a laboratory specimen. Just… do what you have to do. And tell me what you find, quickly. I have steel to bend.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your skin is noticeably darker, particularly on the dorsal surfaces of your hands. It feels slightly rough to the touch, and the temperature is within normal limits. Heart sounds are normal, although your heart rate is a bit on the slower side. And your joints have some mild tenderness, especially in the knuckles, but no signs of inflammation. I'll just take your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. All right, that completes the quick physical exam. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, of course. What else? Fine. Get them done. But I expect a quick turnaround. I haven't got time for endless waiting. Just tell me what you need to know. And, if you don't mind, a simple explanation. I don’t have a medical degree, you know. Steel and rebar, those I understand. This… less so. And I'd prefer if the needles aren't too large. Honestly, the things a working man has to endure.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Drahota. I'll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, iron studies, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check your iron levels, and rule out any thyroid issues. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist uses a smaller gauge needle. It will take a couple of days to get the results back, but I'll call you as soon as they’re available. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial physical exam, we'll need to discuss possible causes for your symptoms. The darkening of your skin, along with fatigue and decreased appetite, could be related to iron deficiency, or potentially a thyroid condition. However, it’s also important to rule out any other underlying medical issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Thyroid… whatever that is? Honestly, it sounds like a lot of trouble for a bit of colour and a bit of tiredness. I work hard, that's all. And I eat what I can when I can. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get the tests done. And call me when you have a proper answer. I haven't got time for speculation. And I'd appreciate it if this was all kept confidential. A working man doesn't want people talking about his ailments. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have steel to bend. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand. Your privacy is of utmost importance to me, and I assure you, all your medical information will be kept strictly confidential. I’ll get the lab orders processed immediately, and we’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Thank you for coming in today. .
