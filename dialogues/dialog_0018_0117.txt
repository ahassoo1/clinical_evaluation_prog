DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. Good morning. Doc, right? Look, I ain’t got a lot of time. Been coughin’… and there’s… stuff. Blood, I think. In the… when I cough. I smoke, you know. A lot. That’s gotta be it, right? Been happenin’ a couple weeks now, maybe longer. Hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, “Doc” is fine. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Reyno. I understand you’ve been experiencing a cough, and you’ve noticed some blood when you cough. You mentioned you smoke, and have for quite some time, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, a long time. Since I was… young. Don’t rightly know how many packs a day, honestly. Too many to count. Used to work out at the power plant, lots of stress. That’s when it really got bad. Now I just… dispatch. Less running around, but still… things. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. It’s not always easy to quantify these things. Thank you for sharing that information with me. The stress from your previous work environment is helpful to know as well. Could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? Uh… it’s… rough. Deep. Like somethin' stuck. And it burns. Mostly in the mornin', when I first wake up. Lately, it’s been… more. More often, and… wetter. And, you know, the blood. It ain't a lot, usually. Just… streaks. Sometimes. Other times nothin’. I just… figured it was the smokin'.
DOCTOR: I see. A deep, rough cough that’s worse in the morning, and you’ve noticed an increase in frequency and wetness, accompanied by streaks of blood. And you attribute it to your smoking history, understandably. To help me get a clearer picture, Mr. Reyno, could you tell me if you've experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. I get tired, easy. More than usual, I mean. And… maybe a little short of breath. But I’m… not a young man anymore, so. I ain’t exactly runnin’ marathons, y’know? I’ve lost a bit of weight too, I guess. But I been tryin’ to lose weight for years. Hard to say if that’s… new.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue, some shortness of breath, and unintentional weight loss. It's good that you're aware of these changes, Mr. Reyno. It's helpful for me to have this information, even if it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. Now, have you had a fever, chills, night sweats, or any chest pain associated with the cough?
PATIENT: Fever? Not that I know of. I haven’t taken my temperature or nothin’. Chills… sometimes I get cold, but that’s just the AC bein’ too high. Night sweats… maybe? I sleep pretty hot, always have. And chest pain… not really. Just… a tightness, sometimes when I cough real bad. Like somethin’ stretched.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills are likely related to the air conditioning, possible night sweats, and chest tightness with severe coughing. Mr. Reyno, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems – that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Lung problems…? Not that I know of. Doc said somethin’ about… mild somethin’ when I was younger, after I started workin’ at the plant. Said it was from the dust. But it didn’t seem bad. Never bothered me much. Diabetes… no. Heart… no. I go to the clinic for check-ups now and then, gettin’ older, gotta. They tell me I’m… okay. For my age.
DOCTOR: I see. So, some mild lung irritation noted in the past, potentially related to your work environment, but nothing significant diagnosed. And you generally receive routine check-ups with your primary care physician. Now, Mr. Reyno, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. That was a long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once after a fall at the plant. Broke my arm. That was… bad. Lots of pain. Other than that… no, not really. Mostly just… doctor’s visits for colds and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, an appendectomy in childhood and a previous hospitalization for a broken arm. Now, Mr. Reyno, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mom… she died when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. My dad… he smoked too. A lot. He got… somethin’ bad in his lungs, later in life. That’s why I started coughin’, I think. I always figured it was gonna happen to me. My sister… she's okay, I think. Don't see her much anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your mother passed away from heart trouble, and your father experienced lung issues, likely related to smoking. And your sister is currently in good health, as far as you know. Now, Mr. Reyno, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any allergies you may have, and what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Not really. I get itchy sometimes, but that’s probably just the dust. Medications… Just some stuff for my blood pressure. The doc gave it to me a couple years back. And… sometimes I take somethin’ for my arthritis. Keeps the joints from gettin’ too stiff. Can’t remember the names right now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Reyno. We can look those up in your records. So, no known allergies, and you're currently taking medication for blood pressure and arthritis. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me about your smoking history a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specific…? What do you wanna know? I started when I was… young, like I said. After high school. Started with a couple a day, then it just… got more. I’ve tried to quit a few times. Didn’t work. Been smokin’… probably a pack and a half a day, for… most of my adult life. Maybe two packs on bad days. It’s a bad habit, I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Reyno. It takes courage to be honest about these things. So, approximately one and a half packs a day for most of your adult life, with increases during times of stress. Alright, Mr. Reyno, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you gotta do. Just… get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno, I’m listening to your lungs now. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes, and some scattered wheezes. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, but these findings could indicate some degree of airway obstruction or inflammation. Your heart rate is 78 beats per minute, which is within a normal range. Your blood pressure is 142/90, which is slightly elevated. Now, let's take a look at your throat… Your throat appears mildly irritated, but there are no signs of acute infection. Alright, Mr. Reyno, thank you for your cooperation. Based on my examination and your history, I'm concerned about the possibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, given your long smoking history and the findings on auscultation. However, we'll need further testing to confirm this.
PATIENT: COPD…? That sounds… bad. Is that what my dad had? What kinda tests? And how long is this gonna take? I really need to get goin’.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Mr. Reyno. COPD can be a serious condition, but it’s also manageable with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. It’s possible that’s what your father had, yes, although I don’t have his medical records to confirm. The tests I’d like to order are a chest X-ray to get a clearer image of your lungs and a pulmonary function test, or PFT, which measures how well your lungs are functioning. The PFT involves breathing into a device that assesses your lung capacity and airflow. Both tests are relatively quick and non-invasive. The X-ray should only take a few minutes, and the PFT will likely take about 30-45 minutes. We can schedule those tests for you today. The scheduling department is just down the hall. Would you like me to call them now while you're still here, or would you prefer to handle it yourself later?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… Okay, fine. Just call ‘em. Get it over with. I ain’t got the energy to deal with more paperwork. Just… tell ‘em to make it as quick as possible. And… is this gonna cost a lot? Medicare covers stuff, right?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Reyno. I understand your concerns. Let me go ahead and call and schedule those tests for you. "Hi, this is Dr. Stilaire’s office. I have a patient, Devin Reyno, date of birth… [I state Mr. Reyno’s date of birth]. I’d like to schedule a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test for him as soon as possible. He is covered under Medicare… Yes, please let me know what the copay will be and what documentation is required." Okay, Mr. Reyno. They were able to schedule you for a chest X-ray this afternoon at 2:00 PM, and the pulmonary function test is scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The copay for both tests is $50, according to Medicare. They will require your Medicare card and a photo ID. While you're waiting for your tests, I recommend that you avoid smoking as much as possible. It will help with the accuracy of the results. Do you have any questions about the tests or the scheduling process?
PATIENT: $50… Okay, I can handle that. Two o’clock, tomorrow at nine… No, I think that’s it. Just… get this over with. Hopefully, it’s nothin’. Just old age, or somethin’. Thanks, Doc.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Reyno. I understand your concerns, and we will do everything we can to get a clear diagnosis and develop a plan to help you. I will send the test results to my office as soon as they are available. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever—please seek immediate medical attention. Here's a printout with the scheduling information and instructions for your tests. Take care of yourself, Mr. Reyno. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: .
