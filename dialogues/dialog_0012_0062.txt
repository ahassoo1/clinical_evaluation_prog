DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Yoshino. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here regarding a matter with my work. Specifically, a request concerning the masks they now require. I'm hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or perhaps alternative arrangements.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, this is related to the new mask requirement at your workplace, and you're looking at options like an exemption or alternatives. That makes sense. Before we get into that, just to get a good overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. I try to stay as healthy as I can. I work as a Protective Service Worker – out in the field, mostly. It keeps me moving, which is good. I don't have any major illnesses, Doctor. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I do have my Medicare, of course, and I see the doctor when I need to – regular checkups, that sort of thing. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active with your job. Protective Services is important work! And it’s helpful to know you don’t have any major medical issues. Just to be thorough, have you been diagnosed with any conditions that might affect your breathing – like asthma, COPD, or anything else lung-related?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven't. Never been diagnosed with any breathing problems at all. I can hold my breath a good long time, even. Used to swim a lot as a boy. Nothing that would make it hard to breathe normally, or anything like that. I assure you, it's not that. It's… well, it’s more a discomfort with the masks themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. So it sounds like the issue isn’t a respiratory condition, but more about the masks themselves causing you discomfort. Can you tell me more about what kind of discomfort you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s…difficult to explain. It isn't so much hard to breathe, it’s more… a feeling of being closed in. A tightness. It brings on a bit of anxiety, truthfully. Makes me feel… trapped. I've tried different kinds – the paper ones, the cloth ones – and they all feel the same. It’s just… the sensation of something covering my face for long periods. I work with people, Doctor, and I need to be calm and clear-headed. This makes it hard to focus, and… it’s unsettling. It reminds me of things… difficult things.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really challenging, and it’s good you're recognizing how it's affecting you – both physically and emotionally. It's perfectly valid to feel anxiety and discomfort with something like that, especially given your profession requires you to be calm and focused. The feeling of being closed in and the association with difficult experiences... that makes a lot of sense. Have you experienced panic attacks or significant anxiety in the past, even unrelated to the masks?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything like that, no. But… yes, I have had times when I’ve felt… overwhelmed. Tightness in my chest, trouble thinking clearly. Mostly during times of great stress. When I was younger, after… difficult situations with my work. It would pass, eventually. I always figured it was just the stress. Never sought treatment for it, if that makes sense. I’m a fairly stoic person, I suppose. Try to handle things on my own. This feels…similar, but triggered by the mask.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, and it's helpful to know about those past experiences. It sounds like you’ve dealt with stress and anxiety before, and this is perhaps a re-emergence of those feelings, triggered by the mask requirement. It's completely understandable. Given your history, and the discomfort you're experiencing, I think it would be good to explore some options. First, let's do a quick physical exam just to rule out any underlying physical causes for the tightness you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be perfectly alright, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and considering my history. A physical exam sounds sensible. I want to be thorough, and I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are. Perhaps we could discuss what alternatives might be available after, if you think that's appropriate? I’m concerned about maintaining my work, and I really don't want to compromise my ability to help people.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take things one step at a time. And yes, we will definitely discuss alternatives after the exam. Your work is important, and we want to find a solution that allows you to continue it safely and effectively. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Good. 130 over 80. Not bad. And your pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Just take some deep breaths in and out for me… Deep breath… and again… Sounds clear. No wheezing, no crackles. Everything looks clear in your throat and ears as well. And finally, I'll just check your chest for tenderness. Take a deep breath… Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain or discomfort. Just the usual tightness when I think about having something over my face for a long period. It’s… anticipatory, I suppose. It's not a physical pain, as such. I’m glad to hear everything else sounds clear. I appreciate your thoroughness. Is there anything else you need to check?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and it helps to clarify things. The fact that the tightness is anticipatory—triggered by thinking about the mask—is significant. It reinforces the idea that there's a strong psychological component to this. Alright, physically everything seems normal. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you’re experiencing anxiety related to wearing a mask, possibly triggered by past experiences, and exacerbated by the feeling of being constricted. Now, let's talk about options. There are a few things we can consider. One is to explore different types of masks – looser-fitting ones, or masks made of different materials. We could also discuss relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, or progressive muscle relaxation – to help manage the anxiety. And, if those don't provide enough relief, we can talk about a referral to a mental health professional – a therapist or counselor – who can help you address the underlying anxiety and develop coping strategies. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: Those all sound like reasonable options, Doctor. I am willing to try different masks, certainly. It can’t hurt to explore that. I am… hesitant about a referral, if I am honest. I’m not one for talking about my feelings, as you might have gathered. But I am willing to try the relaxation techniques. Deep breathing, mindfulness… those I could practice on my own, perhaps. Would you have any resources you could recommend? Something to get me started? I’d prefer to avoid medication, if at all possible. I’m more inclined towards practical solutions I can implement myself.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. I respect your preference to start with practical solutions you can implement yourself, and I understand your hesitation about a referral. It takes courage to explore those options, and you’re right—starting with relaxation techniques is a great first step. I have a few resources I can recommend. There are some excellent guided meditation apps – Headspace and Calm are popular ones. They offer free introductory courses, and a variety of meditations tailored to different needs, including anxiety and stress reduction. I can also print out a handout with some simple deep breathing exercises and mindfulness techniques you can practice at home. Here you go. This handout covers diaphragmatic breathing, box breathing, and a simple body scan meditation. I suggest practicing these techniques for 10-15 minutes each day. I also want you to know that the referral option is always available if you find you’re struggling. There are therapists who specialize in anxiety and trauma, and they can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings. I can provide a list of providers in the area if you’re interested. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. The handout is very helpful, thank you. I will definitely try the exercises. I appreciate you respecting my preference to start with those, and for offering the referral option without pressure. I think I’d like to try the exercises for a couple of weeks, and see how I feel. Perhaps then I’ll be in a better position to decide about a referral, if needed. Is there anything else I should be doing, or any warning signs I should watch out for? I want to be proactive about this, and ensure I can continue my work effectively.
DOCTOR: That's a great attitude, and taking a proactive approach is exactly what I recommend. As you practice the relaxation techniques, pay attention to your body and your emotional state. If you experience any of the following, please contact me or seek immediate medical attention: Severe shortness of breath: This is different from the tightness you’ve described. Chest pain or discomfort: Dizziness or lightheadedness: Panic attacks: Sudden episodes of intense fear or anxiety, accompanied by physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat, sweating, and trembling. Difficulty concentrating or functioning in your daily life: Otherwise, monitor your anxiety levels and see if the exercises help to manage the discomfort. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a couple of weeks to discuss your progress and adjust the plan if needed. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I will certainly monitor for those symptoms, and I appreciate you outlining them so clearly. A follow-up appointment in a couple of weeks would be excellent. I think that gives me enough time to practice the exercises and see how they work. Thank you very much for your time, Doctor Yoshino. You have been very understanding and helpful. I feel much better equipped to handle this now. I truly appreciate your respect for my autonomy, and your practical approach. It has been a very positive experience. I will see you in two weeks, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I'm glad I could help, and I commend you for taking the initiative to address this. Remember, you’re doing great. And please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Have a good day.
