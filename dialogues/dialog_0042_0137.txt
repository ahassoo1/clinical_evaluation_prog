DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place for old people? My son, he want me to go there. He say I need… check-up first? To make sure I okay for live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Abdollahi. A check-up is a great idea before making a transition like that. It’s good your son is thinking ahead. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… lately? I feel… old, mostly. But is okay. I walk a little slow now. And sometimes… forget where I put my glasses. Like now! But nothing too bad. I eat okay, I think. And sleep… mostly good.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal at 72, Ms. Abdollahi. We all experience changes as we get older. It’s good that you’re able to articulate that and are aware of things changing. You mentioned walking a little slower and some forgetfulness – those are common concerns. Can you tell me a little more about the forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Is not… every day. Sometimes I forget what I eat for breakfast. Or… a name. A name of someone I see on TV. Not important names! My family names, I remember those. And… things like how to make my coffee, I still remember that! Is just… small things. Is worry my son, he say. He say maybe is something bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your son is looking out for you, and it’s always best to investigate when there's a concern. Forgetting names or recent events occasionally can be perfectly normal, but we want to rule out anything else that might be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your memory that are worsening or interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Worsening…? Hmm. I… maybe. I used to… I bake a lot. Cakes, cookies, for my grandchildren. Now… I follow the recipe, but sometimes… I put too much sugar. Or… forget the eggs! Small things, yes. Is not like I forget how to bake, I just… make mistake more. And… I get confuse sometimes when I drive. Not lost, but… take wrong turn. Is scare me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Ms. Abdollahi. The changes in baking and the occasional confusion while driving are worth paying attention to. It sounds like it is more than just typical age-related forgetfulness. We should do a thorough check-up to get a clearer picture. Let’s start with a review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical? Let me think. I have… the pressure. High pressure, the doctor say. Many years ago. I take the pills for that. And… my hip. I fall last year, break the hip. They fix it with… metal, I think. That was… pain! But now is okay. Mostly. Not too much pain. I think that is all. Oh! And… sometimes my leg swell. Like… big. But go down with the pills too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, a hip fracture repaired with metal, and swelling in your leg that comes and goes… That’s good information. Are you still taking medication for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every morning. Little white pill. And… the water pill, for my leg. I take that in the afternoon. My son, he make sure I take them. He put them in the… little box, with the days. I would forget, I think, if he not do that.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, it's good to have that support system. Do you know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, Doctor. I just take the pills. My son, he get them. He know the names. I… I not good with the names. Is too much for my old brain, I think! They little white one, and the other one… is blue. I think. Small blue pill. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. We can look those up in your records, or your son could let us know the names when he's able. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything! Sometimes… my skin itchy. But is the heat, I think. The sun. My skin is… old skin. Not like before. No… I don't think I have allergies. I never… get bad sick from food. Never. Maybe a little tummy ache, but everyone get that.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… family. My mother… she get sick. Old sick. She… forget things too. Like me. She go to the hospital, a long time ago. I was small. My father… he strong! No sick. And my brother… he got the pressure, like me. And… my sister, she get the sugar sickness, they say. Diabetes? Is that what you say? She need… shots. Yes, she need shots.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of memory problems in your mother, high blood pressure in your brother, and diabetes in your sister. That’s useful information. Now, to get a better picture of things, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor! Never. Bad for you. My mother, she smoke. But I… never. Too bad for the lungs. I like to breathe!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Abdollahi. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just… a little glass of wine. With my dinner. Not every day. Just… when I feel sad. Or… happy! Not too much, Doctor. I not… drinker. Just… little relaxing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wine occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s talk about your current symptoms. Besides the memory problems and the confusion while driving, are you experiencing any other symptoms – things like headaches, dizziness, weakness, changes in your vision, or difficulty with speech or balance?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… my head hurt. But is just… old head. Like the pressure. And… sometimes I feel dizzy when I stand up too fast. Maybe is the pressure too. And… my eyes… not so good anymore. I need glasses. Like now! But… no trouble talking. And… I think I balance okay. I not fall so much. Just… that one time last year. With the hip.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, occasional dizziness when standing, and some vision problems. We’ll definitely check those out during the exam. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. You check me good. I want to make sure I okay for the old people place. My son, he worry too much. But is good, he love me. You check good, yes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Abdollahi. I will do my best. We'll start with your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and then I’ll check your neurological function – your balance, reflexes, and memory. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m not hearing any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. Now, let’s do a quick balance test. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I close my eyes. Oh… a little dizzy. I open them. Is hard! My son, he say I need more… what you say? Strength? For my legs.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It's good you let me know. It's helpful to see. It is okay to have some difficulty. Let's move on to a quick cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today… Is August. August… Two? Yes! August 2nd. I think. Is Tuesday, right? My son, he tell me. He good with the dates. I not so good.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Ms. Abdollahi. You remembered the date and day of the week. Now, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… The year…? Is… Is… a long time ago! I forget. Sorry, Doctor. Is too many years, maybe? I not remember the year. My brain… is old brain.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi. Don’t worry about it. We'll get a clearer picture with some further testing. Okay, based on this initial exam, we have some findings – a little elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, some balance issues, and some difficulty with short-term memory. I'd like to order some blood work to check your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. And I'd also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to get a better look at your brain. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Brain scan…? Is that… bad? Is something wrong with my brain? My son, he not like… hospital things. He say is scary. I don’t want scary. Blood work is okay, yes? But brain scan… is that necessary, Doctor? I just want to go to the old people place. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s completely natural to feel anxious about these things. A brain scan isn’t necessarily indicating that something is wrong, it’s simply a way to get more information so we can understand what’s going on and provide the best possible care. It helps us rule out things like small strokes or other conditions that could be affecting your memory and balance. It doesn't mean we've found anything. We can certainly discuss it with your son. He’s right to be concerned, and we want to make a decision together that you're all comfortable with. For now, let's focus on the blood work. We'll get those results back quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work is okay. Yes. My son… he come with me next time. He good with the doctors. He ask the right questions. Maybe he talk to you about the brain scan. I just… want to feel safe. And not so… forgetful. Is scary when you forget.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Abdollahi. It's perfectly normal to feel that way, and you are not alone. We will take things one step at a time and do everything we can to help you feel safe and comfortable. I’m going to write an order for the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a small amount of blood, and it shouldn’t take long. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results, and your son can come with you then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound good. Follow-up… with my son. I think I can find the lab. Is just down the hall, you say? Good. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind. I go do the blood work now. And… I see you next time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was lovely meeting you. Don't hesitate to ask the lab staff if you have any questions, and we’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Here’s the order for the blood work and my card if you need to reach me. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. .
