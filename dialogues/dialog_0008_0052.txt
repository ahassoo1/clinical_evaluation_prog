DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, really. Been happening most mornings for the past… oh, must be about a month now, I’d say. It’s not awful, but it's enough to ruin my breakfast, and when you’ve got a heart that doesn’t work quite right, you need your breakfast, don't you?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re absolutely right about needing breakfast, especially with a heart condition. I see here you have a history of… ischemic cardiomyopathy, is that correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s the one. Ischemic cardiomyopathy. Sounds frightening when they tell you, doesn't it? It’s been… well, it's been a few years now since they first told me. I take my pills, try to watch what I eat, though a bit of shortbread never hurt anyone, eh? But this nausea… it's new, and it’s got me a bit worried. It just comes on, usually after I’ve had a few mouthfuls of toast or something. Doesn’t matter what it is, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you’re keeping up with your medications and diet. It's smart to be cautious when something new develops. Can you describe the nausea a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's not like… violent sickness, you understand? No actual throwing up. It's more of a queasy feeling, right in the pit of my stomach. And it comes on fairly quickly, like I said, after I start eating. It doesn't last long, maybe 20 minutes or so, but it's enough to make me lose my appetite for the rest of the morning. Sometimes I feel a bit lightheaded with it, but that’s not every time. And there’s no pain, not a twinge, nothing. Just… unsettled. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No vomiting, queasiness with a bit of lightheadedness... and it’s related to eating. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Now that you mention it… my ankles have been a bit more swollen than usual. Not terribly, mind you, but I’ve noticed I’m having to loosen my shoes a bit more at the end of the day. And I’ve been a wee bit more breathless walking up the stairs, but I put that down to the heat we’ve been having, honestly. It’s been a scorcher these past few weeks. I didn’t think to connect it to the nausea, though. Could that be…?
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing those details. Swelling in the ankles and increased breathlessness could certainly be related. Let’s take a look at your current medications. Are you still taking the lisinopril, metoprolol, and furosemide as prescribed?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Every morning, same time. I’ve got a wee pill organiser, so I never miss one. Lisinopril, metoprolol, and the furosemide… that’s right. I’ve not changed the doses or anything, I assure you. I’m a bit of a stickler for routine, you see. Doctor told me how important they were, and I’ve stuck to it. Though sometimes the furosemide makes me… well, need the bathroom a bit more often, if you catch my drift! But I can live with that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand about the furosemide. That’s a common side effect. Okay, Mr. Benic, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles to assess the swelling. Then we can discuss some possible causes and next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm happy to be poked and prodded if it'll get to the bottom of this. I trust your judgement. Just try not to make a fright of me, eh? I’m not as young as I used to be!
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Benic. I’ll be gentle. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Your heart rate is a bit fast, and I’m hearing a slight murmur, which we know about from previous assessments. Take a few deep breaths, please. Lungs are clear, but with some mild diminished sounds at the bases. Now, let's check your blood pressure… 150/90. A little elevated. And finally, let’s examine your ankles. I do notice some swelling, and it does appear to be pitting edema – meaning there’s fluid retention. Alright, Mr. Benic, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like your nausea could be related to fluid overload secondary to your heart condition. The elevated blood pressure and swelling support that. We need to rule out other causes, though.
PATIENT: Fluid overload, you say? Is that… serious? I mean, I know my heart isn’t the strongest, but I’ve been managing, haven't I? And what does “rule out other causes” mean, exactly? Are we talking tests? I don't mind tests, but I’ve never been fond of hospitals, if you understand. I just… I’d like to know what we’re looking at, if you wouldn't mind explaining it in plain English, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s good to be proactive. Fluid overload means there's too much fluid in your body, putting extra strain on your heart. It can be serious if it's not managed, because it makes your heart work harder and can worsen your symptoms. And yes, "rule out other causes" means we'll need to do some tests. I’m not overly concerned at this point, but it's important to be thorough. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check your kidney function and rule out infection, a basic metabolic panel to assess electrolytes and kidney function, and an EKG to look for any changes in your heart rhythm. We should also do a chest X-ray to see if there's fluid in your lungs. These are all relatively quick and painless tests, and we can do them right here in the clinic today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye… tests sound sensible. A wee bit unsettling, but sensible nonetheless. Kidney function… is that… is something wrong with my kidneys? And the chest X-ray… is that because you think there’s fluid in my lungs? I can feel a bit breathless sometimes, like I said, but I just put that down to getting older and the weather. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, go ahead. Just… explain everything as you go, eh? I don't like surprises. And how long will these tests take? I’ve got a bit of gardening to do this afternoon, if the weather holds. A bit of weeding, nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic. No, the tests aren't because I think anything is necessarily wrong. They're just to get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out other possibilities. The CBC and BMP will tell us how well your kidneys are functioning, and the chest X-ray will help us see if there's any fluid buildup in your lungs that might be contributing to your breathlessness. The tests themselves shouldn’t take too long. The blood draw will be a few minutes, and the EKG and chest X-ray will each be very quick – probably around 5-10 minutes each. The radiographer will need a few moments to position you correctly for the X-ray. All in all, I’d say it will take around 30-45 minutes. We can get them done right away, and I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious, and we can adjust your medication accordingly. After the tests, we can discuss next steps and see if you're able to get back to your gardening this afternoon. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… much better. 30-45 minutes, and then you’ll look at the results. That’s manageable. And adjust the medication… so you think it might be something to do with the pills, then? I’ve been taking them religiously, as you know, but maybe the dose needs tweaking. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get these tests done. Best to get it over with, eh? And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a wee bit. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Benic. We’ll start with the blood draw. Our phlebotomist, Susan, is just down the hall in room 3. She’s very skilled and will make you as comfortable as possible. After that, we'll move on to the EKG and chest X-ray. I’ll be right here, and I’ll review the results as soon as they're available. Don't hesitate to let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point. And remember, we're just gathering information right now. We’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan together. Let’s get started.
PATIENT: Right, then. Susan in room 3, you say? Lead the way, Doctor. And thank you again. It’s good to know someone’s looking after an old man like me! Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Still, best to be safe, eh?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. That’s what we’re here for. And you’re not old! Just… experienced. Susan’s just through this door. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Just let her know if you have any concerns. Here we are. We’ll talk through everything once you’re finished, alright?
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Experienced, you say? Aye, I suppose I am. I’ll see you in a bit.
