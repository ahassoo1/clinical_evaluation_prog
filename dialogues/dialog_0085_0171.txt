DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Devetta Lahn, and I’m one of the family medicine doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Mornin’. It’s… somethin’ with my nails. They just… look funny. Not sure what to do ‘bout it. They ain't been lookin' right for a while now. I don’t remember exactly when they started, though. A long time, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something with your nails.” And you’ve noticed this for a while now, a long time. Can you describe what “not right” looks like?
PATIENT: Well… they’re kinda… discolored. Like, not your normal pink. More… yellow-ish? And thick. Real thick, see? Makes it hard to… clip ‘em, even. And one of ‘em… feels kinda loose, like it's gonna fall off. I don't know why it's doin' that, though. Never happened before. I don't really pay much attention to these things, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discoloration – yellowish – thickening, making clipping difficult, and one nail feeling loose. That’s helpful. And this is all on one nail, or multiple?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly on my big toe nail, the one on my right foot. Maybe a little bit on the other one, but not as bad. I think. Honestly, they all kinda look the same to me these days. I don’t really look at my feet much, you know? Too far down there. I just noticed this one ‘cause it feels… wobbly. Like it's not stickin' on right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to overlook things like that. So, primarily the right big toe is the biggest concern, with maybe some mild changes on the left. Has anything happened to that toe recently?
PATIENT: Hm… not that I remember. I… I don’t go shoppin’ much anymore. Not like I used to. Maybe I stubbed it on somethin’? I don’t know. I’m always walkin’ around the house barefoot, so probably. But I don't recall anything specific. It just… is like that. Is that bad? Should it be bad? I'm not sure why I'm here, honestly. Medicare told me to come, somethin' 'bout checkin' things.
DOCTOR: Medicare is wise to have you come in for a check-up. It's good to get things looked at, even if you're not sure what's going on. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad, but it’s worth investigating. It sounds like this has been gradual. Okay. I'd like to take a closer look at your toes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Sure, I guess. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? My feet are kinda sensitive. And… don’t expect me to know much about what you're lookin' at. I just wanna know if it’s somethin’ I gotta worry 'bout. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be very gentle. And don't worry about medical terms – I'll explain everything clearly. We'll just take a look, and I'll tell you what I think. Okay. I'm seeing some significant thickening of the nail, with a yellowish discoloration. There’s some debris under the nail as well, and it is lifting slightly from the nail bed. It doesn't appear to be acutely inflamed at the moment, but there’s definitely some change to the nail itself. It looks like we're dealing with a fungal infection of the nail, what we call onychomycosis. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Onico… what now? No, that don’t sound familiar at all. Is that… bad? I don't like fancy words. Is it somethin' I caught? From where? I keep my house clean enough, I think. It sounds awful if it's somethin' I brought home. And will it… spread? To my other toes? Or worse? My grandkid comes over a lot... I wouldn't wanna get him sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break that down. "Onychomycosis" is just the medical name for a fungal nail infection. It’s very common, actually. It's not a sign that you're not keeping a clean house. It can happen to anyone. It thrives in warm, moist environments, and often starts with a tiny injury to the nail, like a small cut or even just repeatedly wearing shoes that are a bit too tight. It’s not something you catch like a cold. It's more about the fungus finding a place to grow. And while it can spread to other nails, it's not highly contagious, especially with good hygiene. The risk to your grandchild is very low, especially if you’re both washing your hands regularly. We can definitely talk about ways to prevent it from spreading further, though. Do you have any other concerns right now?
PATIENT: Okay… so it ain’t my fault, exactly. That’s good. I don't like bein' blamed for things. And it won’t hurt the baby? That’s the main thing. But… what do we do about it? Can you just… take it off? Like a hangnail? That’s what I do with the ones on my hands. And will it come back? 'Cause I don’t wanna keep comin’ here if it's just gonna happen again. I have better things to do with my time, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it's absolutely not your fault. And it’s wonderful that you’re thinking about your grandchild. You're a good grandma. Now, about treatment. Unfortunately, it’s not as simple as just removing it like a hangnail. The fungus lives underneath the nail, so just trimming it won’t get rid of it. Plus, removing the entire nail can be painful and take a long time to grow back. There are a few options. We can try topical antifungal medications, which you apply to the nail like a polish. These work best for mild cases, but they can take many months to show results, and they don’t always work. The other option is oral antifungal medication, which is more effective, but it does have potential side effects that we need to discuss. We’d also need to do some blood tests to make sure it’s safe for you to take. It can come back, unfortunately. Fungal infections are stubborn. But there are things we can do to prevent it, like keeping your feet clean and dry, trimming your nails properly, and wearing breathable socks. What are your thoughts on those options?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests? That sounds… awful. I don’t like needles. And months of polishin’ my toe? That’s a lot of work for an old lady. I’m not sure I wanna deal with all that. Is there… anythin’ else? Maybe somethin’ I can just… put on it? Like a cream? I used to use a cream for my hands once, and it helped a little bit. It wasn't a cure, but it made it feel better. I don’t want anythin' too complicated. And I definitely don't want no needles! Is it gonna hurt if I just leave it alone? Will it… get worse? Or will it just stay like that?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns. Needles aren't fun, and months of treatment can be a lot. And you're right, there are some topical creams available that contain antifungal ingredients. They're not as effective as the oral medication or prescription polishes, but they might provide some relief and prevent the infection from spreading. They're a good starting point if you're hesitant about other options. If you leave it alone, it’s unlikely to disappear on its own. It might stay roughly the same for a while, but it could also thicken, become more discolored, and become painful. It also carries a small risk of spreading to other nails or even to the skin around your toes. Let me quickly check your medical history for any other conditions or medications that might affect treatment options. Okay, good. No major contraindications. So, we could try an over-the-counter antifungal cream for now. I can recommend a few brands. We’d apply it daily, and it will likely take several weeks to see any improvement. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to see how it's progressing. If it's not improving, we can discuss other options at that time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright, I guess. Better than needles. And I can do polishin’. I used to paint my nails all the time when I was younger. What kind of cream are we talkin' about? And where do I get it? Is it expensive? Medicare cover that? I don't wanna be payin' a lot of money for somethin' that might not even work. I'm on a fixed income, you know. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try my best. Just no needles, okay? I'm serious about that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no needles, I promise. We’re sticking with the cream for now. There are a few different brands that contain ingredients like clotrimazole or miconazole. They’re available at most drugstores – Walgreens, CVS, even Walmart. They’re relatively inexpensive – usually around $10 to $20 for a small tube. Here’s a handout with some brand recommendations and instructions on how to apply the cream. It’s important to trim your nails regularly and keep your feet clean and dry while you’re using it. As for Medicare, over-the-counter medications aren’t usually covered. But I can write you a note explaining the situation in case your insurance offers any partial coverage. I want you to monitor it closely. If you notice any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus, or increased pain – please call us right away. And if it doesn't start improving after a few weeks, we can discuss other options. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds like a plan. I guess I can try that. I'll get the cream and start polishin'. And I'll remember to call if it gets worse. I'm pretty good at takin' care of myself, you know. I don't wanna bother you unless I really need to. Thank you, dear. You been very helpful. And no needles! I appreciate that very much. I think that’s all I needed. I can go now, right?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lacreasha. I’m glad I could help. And absolutely, you can go now. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here for you. Have a good day, and I'll see you in three months.
