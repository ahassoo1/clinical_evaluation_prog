DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time, Doctor. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he passed, and I want a baby, but I don’t want any of this… trouble. You know? I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. That’s a perfectly reasonable desire, and a very important one. It’s good you're thinking about this now. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and wanting to build a family is a natural feeling. “Easy” is… often a tricky word in medicine, unfortunately, but we can certainly explore options to make things as smooth as possible. To get a better understanding of where we stand, could you tell me a little more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, I don't really keep track of all that. I went to the doctor when I had to, you know? Usual woman stuff. I had my babies with my husband, no problems then. I think. It was a long time ago. I have private insurance, if that matters. I just… I don’t want anything complicated. And I definitely don’t want to be poked and prodded endlessly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Carmaleta. We’ll try to keep things as straightforward as possible. It’s helpful you have private insurance, that gives us more options. Let’s see… to get a clearer picture, even with a history of uncomplicated pregnancies, it’s good to do a basic check-up. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Not recently. Honestly, I mostly just… ignore things until they become a problem. Is that bad? My sister always goes, gets everything checked, but I just… I don't like doctors, if I'm being honest. It's just… unpleasant. Can't we just… start with some pills or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. Many people aren't fond of doctors! And you're not alone in that. While pills are an option we can discuss, it’s important to have a baseline understanding of your overall health before starting any treatment. It’s like building a house – you need a solid foundation. A quick exam allows us to check things like blood pressure, weight – which I see is 130 pounds, and a general check of your well-being. Would you be willing to let me do a brief physical exam today?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But brief. And no… poking. Seriously, Doctor, I mean it. Just the basics. Blood pressure and… whatever you need to weigh me. That’s it. I have things to do, you know? This is taking up my whole afternoon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. Brief is exactly what we'll do. No poking, I promise. Just the basics as you requested. First, let's check your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I don’t even understand why we need to know my blood pressure. It’s probably fine. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: It’s just a routine check, Carmaleta, to make sure everything is working as it should. It gives us a good starting point. Okay… your blood pressure is 135 over 85. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. It could be situational – perhaps you’re a little anxious about being here, or have had caffeine today?
PATIENT: Caffeine? Maybe. I had a coffee this morning. It was a long morning. Does that matter? Look, Doctor, are we getting anywhere or are we just going to sit here and talk about my blood pressure all day? I really need to know if I can just… take something to get pregnant. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: You're right to want to focus on that, Carmaleta. Let’s talk about options to help you get pregnant. To give you the best advice, though, it would be helpful to know a little bit more about your menstrual cycle. Are your periods regular?
PATIENT: Regular? Honestly, I don’t really keep track. They come… eventually. Sometimes a little early, sometimes a little late. It varies. I’ve never really had problems with them, not like some women I know. Is that important? I just want a baby, not a detailed analysis of my… cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Irregular cycles can sometimes make it a little harder to conceive, but it’s not necessarily a barrier. To get a better idea of what’s going on, and to see if there are any underlying reasons for the irregularity, it would be helpful to do a simple blood test. It can check your hormone levels and rule out any potential issues. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A blood test… Ugh. Fine. But can we please hurry? And don't tell me it's going to be painful. I hate needles. Honestly, Doctor, you're making this whole thing much more stressful than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Carmaleta. I'll do everything I can to make it as quick and painless as possible. It's just a small prick, and it will be over before you know it. We'll just need a small sample of blood. I'll tie this little tourniquet around your arm to make the veins easier to find. It might feel a little tight, but it won’t hurt. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And don't poke me too much. Seriously. This is ridiculous. I've had babies, you know? I think I can handle a little blood test.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Carmaleta. Having had babies proves you're very capable! This is just a precaution to get a baseline understanding. Okay, this will just feel like a quick pinch. Deep breath... All done! See?
PATIENT: Ugh. That wasn’t pleasant. And it stings. How long until I can leave? And when will I get the results? I really don’t want to come back here again if I can help it.
DOCTOR: You did great, Carmaleta. It will stop stinging in a few minutes. Just keep gentle pressure on it. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We can either have them sent directly to you, or I can have my nurse call you with the results. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Just call me. I don't want to have to deal with paperwork and labs. And please, make sure it's a nurse who understands I don't want a lot of medical jargon. Just… tell me if I can take something to get pregnant. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I’ll make sure my nurse understands your preferences. She’ll contact you directly with the results and focus on discussing potential treatment options. In the meantime, it might be helpful to start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. That can help prepare your body for pregnancy. You can find them over-the-counter at any pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. Just… call me when you have something useful to tell me. Honestly, this has been a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. You have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
