DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, actually. I've been having some pain… down there. It’s hard to explain. I don't usually… talk about these things. It started a little while ago, and it’s been… bothering me. I apologize for being so vague. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Stepro. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time. “Down there” – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, of course. It’s… in my groin, I suppose. And… well, it’s in my testicles. One of them… aches. It’s not constant, but it comes and goes. I really don’t know what brought it on. Honestly, I’m a bit confused about the whole thing. I work with wood all day, so maybe it’s something to do with that? It's just a thought.
DOCTOR: Groin and testicular pain. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Stepro?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Let me think… it feels like… several weeks, perhaps? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Time… it slips away these days. I would say at least a month, maybe longer. It wasn't terribly bad at first, just a mild discomfort. But it's been getting… more noticeable lately. I apologize for not being more precise.
DOCTOR: A month or so. And is the pain constant, intermittent, sharp, dull… can you describe the quality of the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Quality… that’s a difficult one. It's not sharp, exactly. More… a dull ache, I think. A heavy feeling. And as I said, it’s not always there. It comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, it’s enough to make me sit down. It’s… uncomfortable, more than anything. And sometimes, it sort of… radiates. Does that make sense? It feels like it travels up into my lower abdomen a little.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, intermittent, radiating to the lower abdomen. Alright. Have you noticed any swelling or a lump in either of your testicles?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked closely, to be honest. I don't usually examine myself like that. I… I don't know if there is. I suppose I could check, but… I'm not sure I’d know what to look for, even if I did. It doesn’t feel swollen, if that makes any sense. But I haven’t actively checked, no. Perhaps that's something you should do? I’m happy to, if you'd like.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll certainly do a physical exam. That’s the next step. Before we do that, have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. No fever, no nausea, certainly no vomiting. Everything has been… normal, as far as that goes. And my urination is… well, it's the same as always. No pain, no changes in frequency… nothing like that. I’m relieved it’s not more than just the pain, if that makes sense. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Having something ache down there.
DOCTOR: No systemic symptoms, normal urination. Alright. And finally, have you experienced any recent trauma to the groin area, like a fall or injury?
PATIENT: Trauma… hmm. No, not that I recall. I work with wood, as I mentioned, so there are little bumps and scrapes sometimes, but nothing… significant. No major falls or injuries. I haven’t had any accidents, thankfully. I try to be very careful. I'm usually quite steady on my feet. Unless… last month, I did stumble over a stack of lumber. It wasn't a hard fall, just a little wobble. But I didn't think anything of it at the time. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: A minor stumble last month. Alright. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table for me. I need to examine your abdomen and then we'll take a closer look at the groin area and testicles. It’s best to be thorough, Ms. Stepro.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, Doctor. If you think it’s best. It feels a bit strange, but… I trust your judgment. Please let me know if there is anything I should do or if I need to adjust my position. I apologize in advance if I’m not very cooperative. I'm not used to these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I'm just going to palpate your abdomen first. This will help me check for any tenderness or masses. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly painful. No obvious tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to examine the groin area and testicles. Please let me know if anything causes you discomfort. Right testicle feels normal in size and consistency. Left testicle… …feels slightly enlarged. There is a small, firm nodule on the upper pole. Not acutely tender, but definitely present. No signs of acute inflammation or epididymitis. Scrotal skin is normal. I’ve identified a small nodule on your left testicle. It’s not acutely painful, which is good, but it does warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A nodule? That doesn't sound… good. Further investigation? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I must confess, I'm getting quite anxious now. My heart is racing. Is it… could it be… cancer? I apologize for asking such a dreadful question, but… my mind is going to the worst possible place.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, it’s understandable to be anxious. A nodule can be concerning, but it does not automatically mean cancer. Many things can cause a testicular nodule – cysts, inflammation, benign growths. We need to determine the cause, and the best way to do that is with a scrotal ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. We will also order a urinalysis to rule out any infection. I want to be clear: we are not jumping to any conclusions. But because of the nodule, we need to be thorough. I'm going to write an order for these tests. The ultrasound can be done at the imaging center across the street, and they usually have same-day appointments. We’ll get the results back within 24 to 48 hours. Until then, avoid strenuous activity and support your scrotum with close-fitting underwear. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a urinalysis. Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose that’s the only way to know for sure. Close-fitting underwear… yes, I can do that. I think I understand. Will the ultrasound… will it hurt? And… if it is something serious, what are the… what are the options? I apologize for being so blunt, but… it’s best to know, isn’t it? I prefer honesty, even if it's difficult. And… who should I tell? My family… I don’t want to worry them unnecessarily, but…
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is completely painless, Ms. Stepro. It uses sound waves to create an image, so there's no radiation or discomfort involved. As for your other questions… if it is something concerning, there are very effective treatments available, particularly if caught early. Surgery is often the first line of defense, and there are other options like radiation therapy, depending on the specific diagnosis. We’ll discuss all of those options in detail if necessary, after we have the results of the tests. Regarding who to tell… that is entirely your decision. It’s perfectly acceptable to wait until you have more information before sharing anything with your family. It’s important to protect your own emotional well-being, and you should only share what you’re comfortable sharing. However, having a support system can be very helpful, so consider if there’s someone you trust who could provide emotional support during this time. Here are the orders for the ultrasound and urinalysis. The imaging center’s number and address are on the form. I want you to schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Once you have the results, please call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment, and we’ll discuss them together. Do you have any other questions before we conclude for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for being so… thorough and honest with me. You have put my mind at ease, a little, at least. Knowing what to expect… it helps. I will schedule the ultrasound right away. And I will call your office as soon as I have the results. Thank you again, Doctor Paulino. I appreciate your kindness. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we're taking this one step at a time. I'll see you soon. Goodbye. .
