DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Well, it’s about my… well, my business. You know, when a man gets to my age, things aren't always what they used to be. I noticed some… red in the bowl this morning. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to bother a fella. It’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Changes like that can be unsettling. So, you noticed some blood in your stool this morning?
PATIENT: Blood, yes. Not like a gushing wound, thankfully. More like… streaks. And it wasn’t just this morning, come to think of it. A couple of times last week too, though I figured it was just something I ate. You know, beets or something. Though I haven't had beets in ages... Honestly, I don't keep track of all that nonsense anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said this has happened a couple of times over the last week?
PATIENT: Well, maybe not exactly a week. Time gets away from you, doesn’t it? More like… a few times since I was visiting my daughter in Seattle. Awful city, if you ask me. Too much hustle and bustle. Though, that's neither here nor there. Point is, it started around then. It's not constant, mind you. Just… occasional.
DOCTOR: Seattle… alright. And has there been any change in your bowel habits alongside this, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What’s that mean, exactly? I go when I need to go, same as always. Though, now that you mention it… it’s been a little… thinner, maybe? Not watery, just not as… substantial as it used to be. I blame the food these days. Everything's so processed, full of… I don't know… chemicals. Makes a man’s stomach work overtime, I tell you what.
DOCTOR: Thinner stools, and the blood… alright. And have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting alongside this?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... a bit of a rumble in the belly, sometimes. Nothing to write home about, just a little discomfort. Like when you’ve eaten something that doesn’t quite agree with you. No vomiting, though. I haven't thrown up in… well, a long time, thankfully. I’m not one for a lot of fuss, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. And do you have any family history of colon cancer or other digestive issues, if you’re aware?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, God rest her soul, she had… something. Stomach trouble, I think. Spent a lot of time in bed. But it was ages ago, before all this fancy medical stuff. They just gave her tonics, I believe. My father was a strong man, never a sick day in his life. Though he did enjoy his whiskey… could have been that, I suppose. Don’t rightly know. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your abdomen and overall health. And then, given your symptoms and age, I think it would be prudent to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood and possibly a blood test to rule out any other issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmph. Tests, eh? Always with the tests. Seems like all doctors do these days. Fine, fine. Get it over with. Just don’t poke and prod too much, alright? I’m an old man, my bones aren't what they used to be. And I’m not keen on giving up a bunch of… fluids, if you know what I mean. Though, if it gets me out of here quicker… alright. Do your tests.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle as possible. The stool test is quite simple, and the blood test is just a small sample. If you could just lie down here, and we’ll get started. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and then gently press on it to check for any tenderness. Afterwards, I'll explain the results as soon as they're available.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect me to be comfortable. And please, try to be quick about it. I've got a perfectly good afternoon nap waiting for me. . Don't go poking around too much, you hear?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Just breathe normally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: A little… right there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Been feeling that off and on for a couple of days now, come to think of it. You're pressing right on it now. Careful, you're poking!
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Rowbottom. Just noting that tenderness. And any pain radiating anywhere else – to your back, for example?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… a bit of a twinge in my lower back. Nothing serious, just a little ache. I blame the garden, mostly. Been trying to keep the weeds down, but it's hard work for an old man. Used to be able to do it all myself, but now… well, things aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s all for the physical exam. I’ve noted the tenderness in your lower left abdomen and the twinge in your back. Now, I’m going to order a stool test to check for occult blood, and a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. The lab will need a sample, and the nurse will provide you with instructions on how to collect it. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Occult blood… fancy words. Fine, fine. A sample. Just tell me exactly what I need to do, and don’t make it complicated. I’m not good with all this… modern nonsense. And I expect clear instructions, mind you. No mumbo jumbo.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. The nurse will give you a kit with a special collection container and instructions. It will involve collecting a small stool sample after your next bowel movement. The instructions will be very clear, and she can walk you through it if you have any questions. It's important to avoid red meat and certain medications for 72 hours before collecting the sample, as they can affect the results. The nurse will provide a detailed list. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Seventy-two hours, eh? No red meat… Good grief. That's half my diet! And what medications? I take a few things… for my joints, mostly. This is getting complicated. Alright, alright. Just… write it down for me, will you? A list of everything I can’t have. And don’t expect me to remember it all. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Here's a detailed list of the medications to avoid and the dietary restrictions for the stool test. The nurse will also go over it with you. We’re mainly looking for hidden blood, which can indicate a number of things, and the blood test will help us rule out other possibilities. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any immediate questions about the list or the procedure?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Aspirin… Ibuprofen… That’s most of what I take for my aches. And no red meat… This is a terrible inconvenience. So, no steak, no burgers… what can I eat? This sounds like a diet for a rabbit.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not ideal, I agree. But it’s only for a few days, and it’s important for accurate results. You can still eat plenty of chicken, fish, vegetables, fruits, and other non-red meat protein sources. The list has a more detailed breakdown of what's acceptable. And the nurse can help you with meal suggestions if you like. We’re just trying to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and this will help us do that. Once we have the results, we can adjust your medication and diet accordingly. Now, the nurse will be in shortly to collect a sample for the blood test and give you further instructions. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Chicken and fish... It's not steak, that's for sure. And what about… about beer? Can I still have my beer? It's good for the… for the circulation, you see. A man needs his comforts.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Rowbottom. Moderate alcohol consumption is generally acceptable, but it’s best to avoid excessive amounts while we’re looking into this. Perhaps limit yourself to one or two beers a day. The nurse can provide more specific guidance if you're concerned. We don’t want to interfere with the test results. Now, is there anything else I can clarify before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: One or two… barely enough to wet my whistle. Humph. Well, I suppose it’s better than nothing. No, I don’t think that’s all. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long, alright? I’m an old man, and I tire easily. And please tell that nurse to speak clearly. I’m not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns, and I’ll do my best to expedite things. We appreciate your patience. I’ll leave you to rest until the nurse arrives. If you need anything in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call. Thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: Finally. Now, if only they hadn’t taken so long… Blood tests, stool samples… what have I gotten myself into?
