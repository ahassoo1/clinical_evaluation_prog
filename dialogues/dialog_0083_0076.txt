DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s these… bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda sore. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. “Bumps on your legs, mostly on your shins, red and sore.” Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these bumps?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was probably… oh, maybe a month ago? Started with just one or two, and I didn't think much of it. Thought maybe I bumped into somethin’. But then more kept showin’ up. Now there’s quite a few.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, starting with one or two and gradually increasing in number. And are they itchy, painful, or both?
PATIENT: More painful than itchy, I’d say. Not a sharp pain, but kinda… achy, you know? Especially if I brush against somethin’ or wear certain pants. It’s not constant, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy pain that’s aggravated by contact. And have you noticed anything that makes them better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, to be honest. Maybe when I rest my legs, it’s not so bad. But I’m on my feet a lot for work, so restin’ ‘em isn’t always easy. They don’t seem to get better on their own, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. So they don’t improve with rest, and are worsened by activity. Have you tried any creams, lotions, or home remedies to try and alleviate the pain?
PATIENT: You know, I put some regular lotion on ‘em a few times. Just regular stuff, keeps my skin from gettin’ too dry. But it didn’t really do anything, to be honest. Didn’t make ‘em better or worse, just… lotion. I haven't tried anything special for ‘em, no. I figured I’d come see you before messin’ around with stuff I don’t know about.
DOCTOR: That was wise of you. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Well, I got high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it every day. And my knees, they bother me sometimes, gets a little stiff. But other than that, nothin’ too serious. My wife keeps after me to eat better, but you know how it is.
DOCTOR: I do understand. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee stiffness. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to a pill before. I can eat just about anything. My wife says I eat too much, maybe! But no allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for my blood pressure. That's it. I try to keep it simple, you know? Don’t like takin’ a whole bunch of stuff if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the medication for your high blood pressure. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my arm playin’ baseball. But other than that, nothin’ serious. Haven’t needed much doctorin’ in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in childhood and hospitalization for a broken arm. And do you have any family history of skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had… some kinda rash sometimes, when I was growin’ up. I don't know what it was, she just said it was a skin thing. My wife thinks my brother had somethin’ similar, but I’m not really sure. Nobody ever talked about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible family history of a skin condition. And lastly, regarding your social history, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or work in a profession that exposes you to certain chemicals or irritants?
PATIENT: Nah, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but I don’t much anymore. And I’m a laborer, you know? Moving freight, stock, stuff like that. Mostly just… dirt and dust, I guess. Sometimes I work with cardboard, if that counts. Nothing too fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and a job involving manual labor with exposure to dirt and dust. Alright, Mr. Aluia, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to take a look at your legs, if you don't mind. Could you please sit on the examination table and I’ll take a look at the bumps?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, no problem. Go ahead and take a look. Hope they're not too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see several erythematous papules and nodules on your bilateral shins. They range in size from approximately 0.5 to 1.5 centimeters. There is some mild surrounding inflammation, but no signs of open sores or drainage. They appear to be somewhat firm to the touch. Do you experience any pain when I palpate them?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that’s a little tender. Not awful, but… yeah, definitely feel it when you press on ‘em. Like a bruise, kinda. Not as bad as a real bruise, but similar.
DOCTOR: Alright, tenderness to palpation noted. Based on the appearance and your history, these bumps are highly suggestive of stasis dermatitis, also sometimes referred to as venous stasis dermatitis. It's often caused by poor circulation in the legs, leading to inflammation and skin changes. It is common in patients with a history of high blood pressure. To rule out other possibilities, like cellulitis or a deep vein thrombosis, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a D-dimer test. We will also check your ankle-brachial index to assess the blood flow in your legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Whoa, okay… stasis dermatitis? Poor circulation? Is that… serious? And those tests… are they gonna hurt? I don't like needles much, Doctor. What does all this mean? Is this somethin’ I need to worry about? I just wanna get rid of these bumps, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Aluia, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. Stasis dermatitis isn't necessarily serious in the sense of being life-threatening, but it is a sign that your circulation isn’t optimal, and we want to address that. Left untreated, it can lead to skin ulcers and other complications, which is why we’re taking it seriously. The blood tests are fairly routine. The CBC will help us rule out any infection, and the D-dimer test will check for blood clots. As for the ABI, it’s a non-invasive test where we measure your blood pressure in your ankles and arms. It doesn’t involve any needles at all. A technician will simply place cuffs around your legs and arms, similar to when we check your blood pressure. It’s important to remember that we’re gathering information to make the best possible diagnosis and treatment plan for you. We'll start with these tests and go from there. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a little better, I guess. No needles for the ABI is good. So, you're saying it's not like, a bad infection or anything? Just my circulation bein’ bad? And skin ulcers… that doesn’t sound good. What can I do about it? Can I put somethin’ on ‘em to make ‘em feel better while we’re waitin’ for the test results?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It’s not currently indicative of a severe infection, but the CBC will help us confirm that. And you’re right to be concerned about skin ulcers. That's why we want to get this under control. While we await the test results, you can take a few steps to help manage the symptoms. I recommend keeping your legs elevated whenever possible, especially when you’re resting. This helps to reduce swelling and improve circulation. Compression stockings, specifically 20-30 mmHg, can also be very helpful. Do you currently wear compression stockings?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Never have. Compression stockings… those are like, really tight, right? Don’t think I could stand that. Is there anything else I can do? Like a cream or somethin'? And… what if they do find somethin’ bad? What happens then? I’m gettin’ a little worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Mr. Aluia. Compression stockings can feel tight at first, but they’re a very effective way to improve circulation. We can start with a lower compression level if you’re concerned, and see how you tolerate them. The technician will help fit you properly. For the bumps themselves, a topical corticosteroid cream can help reduce inflammation and itching. I’ll write you a prescription for triamcinolone 0.1% cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for one week. If the tests reveal a blood clot, you may need medication to thin your blood. If it’s just poor circulation, we’ll focus on managing your blood pressure, lifestyle modifications like regular exercise and a healthy diet, and keeping your legs elevated and compressed. We’ll discuss all the options in detail if that’s the case. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first, and then we’ll have a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… a cream sounds good. I can handle that. And I guess I can try the stockings… if they're not too tight. Tests first, then see what happens. Alright, let’s get the tests done. What do I need to do? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The technician will be in shortly to draw blood for the CBC and D-dimer. After that, they will perform the ankle-brachial index test right here in the examination room. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes in total. Once the results are available, my nurse, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. She’ll also provide you with instructions on how to obtain the compression stockings. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… try to make it quick, okay? And tell Sarah to be gentle with the needle. Alright, let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll let Sarah know to be as gentle as possible. I’ll step out now and let her come in. It was good speaking with you, Mr. Aluia. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
