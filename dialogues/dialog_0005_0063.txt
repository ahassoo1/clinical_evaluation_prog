DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Well, my back… it really hurts. Bad. It started a few weeks ago, but it’s gotten worse and worse. It’s a different kind of hurt than I’ve had before, you know? I had cancer a while back… and I’m worried it might be that again.
DOCTOR: Okay, “different kind of hurt” is good to know. And understandably, with a history of cancer, that's the first place your mind goes. We'll definitely figure this out. Let's start with this back pain. Can you tell me exactly where it hurts?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not just one spot. It’s… low down, in my back. But it feels like it goes all the way around, kinda. Like a big band. And sometimes it shoots down my legs. Both legs, but the left one is worse. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. "A big band" is a good way to put it. So, low back pain radiating around, going down both legs but worse on the left… alright. And when did you first notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was after I helped my niece move some boxes. Big, heavy boxes. She just had a baby, so she couldn’t lift anything. I felt a little pull then, but I didn't think much of it. Just thought I strained something. But then, a few days later, it started hurting more and more. That was… maybe three weeks ago? Around the first of July, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around July 1st, after lifting boxes for your niece. And it’s been progressively worsening. You said it’s a different kind of pain than you’ve experienced before… can you describe what this pain feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… not a sharp pain, exactly. It’s more like a… ache. A deep ache. And sometimes it feels like pins and needles. Especially in my left leg. It’s… hard to sleep. I keep tossing and turning. And when I try to stand up after sitting for a while, it’s really hard. Like my legs are gonna give out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Deep ache, pins and needles in the left leg, difficulty sleeping, and trouble standing after sitting. Okay. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. You mentioned cancer previously – what type of cancer was that, and when were you treated?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Um… it was breast cancer. I was diagnosed about… eight years ago. 2017, I think. I had surgery, and then… radiation. No chemotherapy, thank goodness. They said it was caught early, so I didn't need it. I've been going for check-ups ever since. Everything was good last time, but… like I said, I get worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, breast cancer diagnosed in 2017, treated with surgery and radiation, no chemotherapy, and regular follow-ups with everything clear. Good. And besides the breast cancer, do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but I lost some weight and it went away. Now it’s normal. Just… old age, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but… that’s it. I try to stay active, you know? Walk when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, so controlled blood pressure now, otherwise generally healthy. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up – just ibuprofen. But I don’t take it very often. Not every day or anything. Just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. My mom always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. That’s a good start. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your back, legs, and reflexes. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s causing this pain. And if it’s… something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, I'm going to gently feel along your spine. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender or painful. …Alright, and how does that feel right here?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a little sore. Right there, on the left side. Not sharp, but… definitely uncomfortable. It feels… tight. Like a knot. And when you push on it… it kinda shoots that pain down my leg a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tenderness on the left side of your lower back with some referred pain down the leg. Now I'm going to have you bend forward, backward, and to each side. Just see how that feels. Don't push yourself if it's too painful. …Alright, go ahead and bend forward now.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… hard. It hurts in my back, and my legs feel kinda weak. I can’t go all the way down, it’s too much. And it’s… tight. Like something is blocking me. It feels better standing straight, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited forward flexion. Now, I’m going to have you lie on your back. We’ll do a straight leg raise. I'm going to lift your leg up, keeping it straight. Let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. …Alright, just relax your leg, and I’m going to lift it slowly. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Okay… It’s okay so far. But… wait. Yes! There it is! When you lift it up… it shoots that pain down my left leg again. Not all the way, but… definitely there. Like a… electric shock. It’s worse when my leg is straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, positive straight leg raise on the left side, reproducing radicular pain. That tells us something. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Just a quick test. …Alright, can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Both of them. It's a little hard, but… I can do it. They feel kinda… numb, though. Not completely, but… like pins and needles. And my left leg feels weaker than my right leg, I think. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy – meaning a bulging disc in your lower back is pressing on a nerve, causing pain to radiate down your leg. The numbness, weakness, and positive straight leg raise are all consistent with that. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean you need surgery. Most people improve with conservative treatment, like physical therapy, pain medication, and anti-inflammatories. However, I want to get an MRI just to confirm the diagnosis and see the extent of the herniation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that’s fine. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. I just want to know what’s going on. And… if it is serious. Like… the cancer again? I mean, is this something I should be really scared about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're asking. While the symptoms can be similar, this feels very different from what you described with your breast cancer. Cancer rarely presents with this type of radicular pain and neurological findings. This is much more likely a mechanical issue – a problem with the structures in your spine. The MRI will help us visualize that. We'll also rule out any other causes for your pain. I'm going to order the MRI, and I'll also write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant and some ibuprofen to help manage the pain in the meantime. I'll also give you a referral to physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and improve your range of motion. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… muscle relaxants and ibuprofen… and physical therapy. That sounds… good. I guess. But… how long will it take to get the MRI? And… will the physical therapy hurt? I'm already in so much pain. And… what if it is something really bad? What then?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions. The MRI usually takes a few days to schedule, depending on availability. I'll have my nurse call you tomorrow to set that up. As for the physical therapy, it can be uncomfortable at first, but a good therapist will start slowly and tailor the exercises to your pain level. They’ll focus on gentle stretches and strengthening exercises. It’s not meant to exacerbate your pain, but to relieve it over time. And regarding your concern about something more serious… we'll know more once we have the MRI results. If it's a more complex issue, we'll discuss all your options, including specialist referral if necessary. But right now, let's focus on getting the MRI and starting conservative treatment. We'll take things one step at a time. I'm going to print out some information about lumbar disc herniation for you to read, and I’ll also give you a prescription for the medication. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write that prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Okay… no allergies. And… information about the disc thing… good. That will help me understand. And… will the nurse call me tomorrow about the MRI? What time should I expect the call? I don’t want to miss it. I have to be home.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will call you tomorrow. She usually starts making calls around 10 AM, but it could be a little later depending on how busy she is. Just keep your phone handy, and if you don’t hear from her by the afternoon, feel free to call the clinic and ask. Here are those printouts about lumbar disc herniation, and here’s the prescription for the muscle relaxant and ibuprofen. Take them as directed, and if you experience any side effects, don’t hesitate to call us. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained everything really well. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you listening to me. It’s just… scary, you know? But I feel a little better now. I’ll wait for the nurse to call tomorrow.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand it’s scary, and I’m glad I could ease some of your worries. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before the nurse calls. Have a good day, and I’ll see you after we have the MRI results.
