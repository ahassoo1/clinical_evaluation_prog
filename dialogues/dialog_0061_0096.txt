DOCTOR: Bula and good afternoon, Arbin. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Kimm, it's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this light sensitivity thing. It's been bothering me for a bit now, and figured it was best to get it checked out. It's just… everything seems so bright, you know? Even indoors sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, light sensitivity, or photophobia, that’s good you’re getting it checked out. And yes, I understand – it can be really disruptive when everyday lights become uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it probably started… oh, around April, I’d say. Maybe a little before that. It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually things felt a bit too much. I didn't really pay much attention at first, thought it was just being tired, to be honest. It’s gotten worse lately though, that’s why I made the appointment. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like I need to squint all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually around April and has been worsening recently, causing you to squint frequently. Is the sensitivity to light consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly consistent, yeah. But some days are worse than others. Cloudy days are definitely better. And… direct sunlight is the worst, obviously. But even the lights in the grocery store, or my phone screen sometimes… they bother me now too. It’s not painful, exactly, just… really irritating and makes my eyes feel strained.
DOCTOR: Alright, so consistent sensitivity, worse with direct sunlight, but also affecting indoor lights and screens, and causing eye strain. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the light sensitivity?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Now that you mention it, my eyes have been a bit dry lately. Not constantly, but I find myself blinking more, trying to get them to feel comfortable. And… I guess I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but with everything going on… it’s hard to say if that’s related. Oh! And a couple of times I’ve felt a little bit of a headache, a dull ache behind my eyes. Not bad, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes, increased fatigue, and occasional dull headaches behind the eyes. Have you had any changes in your vision – blurry vision, seeing spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My vision feels… normal. I wear glasses for reading, have for years, but the prescription hasn't changed recently. Everything still looks clear, just… brighter than it should. No spots or blurriness, thankfully. That would be worrying.
DOCTOR: Good to hear your vision itself hasn’t changed. And you haven't had any recent injuries to your eyes or head, have you?
PATIENT: No, no injuries at all. I'm pretty careful, honestly. Nothing like that. I haven’t bumped my head or anything, and no chemicals or anything near my eyes, I promise. I work as a dental assistant, so we're very careful about safety there too.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s managed with medication. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. Lost my wife a couple years back, but that was… unrelated. Aside from that, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Do you need to know what medication I'm on for the blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Knowing the name of your blood pressure medication is important. Also, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry. It's Lisinopril. I take 20mg every morning. And allergies… hmm. I’m allergic to penicillin, makes me break out in a rash. Nothing else that I know of. No food allergies, thankfully. And I haven’t had any reactions to any other medications recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and a penicillin allergy. Have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that’s about it for surgeries. And I had the flu pretty badly a few years back, but nothing else serious. No major illnesses or anything like that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Lots of water, try to eat right…
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a bout of the flu a few years ago. And lastly, is there a family history of any eye conditions, migraines, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. My mother had… cataracts, I think. She needed surgery for them when she got older. And my aunt, on my father's side, she had terrible migraines. Really bad ones. I don't think anyone else in the family had any eye problems or autoimmune diseases that I know of. It's a pretty big family, so it's hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of cataracts and migraines. Thank you for that information, Arbin. Now, I’d like to do a quick eye exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your vision, pupils, and looking at the back of your eye. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Absolutely, go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking straight ahead… can you read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Let me adjust my glasses… Okay, um… E… F… P… Z… uh… K… and… C. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in both eyes. That’s slightly reduced, but not drastically so. Now, I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes to get a look at your retinas. This won't hurt, but it might be a little bright. The retinas look healthy, no signs of bleeding or swelling. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Your eyes appear generally healthy, but the photophobia is concerning. Given the gradual onset, the headaches, and the slightly reduced visual acuity, I'm suspecting either early cataracts developing, or possibly a migraine-associated photophobia. It could also be related to a side effect of the Lisinopril, although that’s less common.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Early cataracts… that explains the blurry vision a little. I hadn’t even thought of that. And I suppose the headaches could be migraines. The medication thing is a bit worrying, though. I don’t want to have to stop taking it if I can avoid it. What do we do next? Is there a test we can do to figure it out?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair concern, we definitely want to explore all options before changing your medication. To help clarify the cause, I'd like to order a few tests. Firstly, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying inflammation. Secondly, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, as Lisinopril can affect that. And finally, I'd like to schedule you for a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They can perform a more detailed assessment of your lens and retina, and determine if cataracts are developing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Whatever tests you think are best, I’m happy to do them. A more detailed eye exam sounds good too, just to be sure. Blood work and seeing a specialist… alright, that’s fine. How do we go about scheduling those? And will my insurance cover everything? I have Medicare, I believe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a referral for the ophthalmologist and an order for the blood work. The lab is just across the hall, and they take Medicare, so there shouldn't be any issues there. I'll also have my nurse print out a list of ophthalmologists in the area who accept Medicare, and their contact information. As for the ophthalmologist appointment, you’ll need to call their office directly to schedule. They will be able to confirm your coverage. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to manage your blood pressure with the Lisinopril as prescribed. And in the meantime, to help alleviate the light sensitivity, I suggest wearing sunglasses outdoors, even on cloudy days, and minimizing screen time when possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very clear, thank you. Sunglasses and less screen time… I can definitely manage that. It’s good to know we’re being thorough with the tests and the specialist appointment. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so well, Dr. Kimm. I feel a lot better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could ease your mind. We'll get these tests done and see what the ophthalmologist says. If anything changes before your appointment, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s the referral and lab order. My nurse will also bring you that list of ophthalmologists shortly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for everything, Dr. Kimm. I’ll go get the blood work done and schedule the appointment with the specialist. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
