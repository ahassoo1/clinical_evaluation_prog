DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a little embarrassing, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's… different than it usually is. I can't really describe it, just that it's not right.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor, you say. I understand it can be disconcerting when something feels… off. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay. Um, it started maybe a week or two ago? It’s not worse, exactly, just… different. Like, usually I don’t smell much of anything at all, you know? I shower every day, deodorant, everything. But now, even after showering, there’s this… almost sweet smell? It’s faint, but I can definitely notice it. And my daughter mentioned it, so it’s not just me.
DOCTOR: A sweet odor… that is noteworthy. And it’s persistent even with your usual hygiene routine, and your daughter has also detected it. Very well. Now, Ms. Purtee, have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No major illnesses, not even a cold. I have been a little more tired than usual, I guess. Just… generally feeling run-down. And my appetite’s been a bit off, not eating as much as I normally do. But honestly, I just figured that was from the heat. It’s been so hot lately. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and decreased appetite can be relevant, Ms. Purtee, particularly in conjunction with the change in body odor. Let’s explore this a little further. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, even unintentional?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yes. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes have been feeling a little looser. Not a lot, but enough that I noticed it. I just thought it was the heat making me sweat more and maybe shrinking things! It's probably not much, maybe a couple of pounds, but definitely some.
DOCTOR: A couple of pounds of unintentional weight loss, along with the fatigue, decreased appetite, and altered body odor… this warrants a more thorough investigation. Ms. Purtee, I’m going to need to ask you a few questions about your medical history. First, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. High blood pressure a few years ago, but the doctor put me on a little pill and it’s been fine ever since. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? No diabetes or anything like that. I get my yearly check-ups. They haven’t mentioned anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Very good. And you mentioned a medication for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I've been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now? It keeps everything under control. I haven’t changed the dosage or anything. I get it refilled automatically, so I always have it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, ten milligrams daily. That is noted. Now, Ms. Purtee, let's discuss your family history. Are there any instances of diabetes, cancer, or other significant illnesses in your immediate family – your parents, siblings, or children?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure too, just like me. And she had arthritis, really bad. My father… he had heart problems, I think. Something with his cholesterol. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of the details. And my sister is healthy as a horse, always been very active. No cancer that I know of, thankfully. Nothing else really stands out.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Purtee, to complete the picture, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical work. Lots of bending, lifting, being on my knees. It keeps me moving, though. I live alone since my divorce about ten years ago. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a month. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes it's hard when I’m working long hours and just grab something quick. I don’t really have a lot of hobbies right now, just mostly relaxing when I get home.
DOCTOR: Physical work, living alone, occasional wine… I see. Now, Ms. Purtee, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Maybe a little bit of night sweats, but it is so hot. I thought that was just the weather. And sometimes my skin feels a little itchy, but again, could be the heat. Nothing major, definitely not enough to mention to the doctor. I haven't noticed anything else unusual. Do you want me to keep thinking?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. Even seemingly minor details can be relevant. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… now that you mention it, yes. A little. I’ve been… more constipated than usual. It’s not terrible, but it’s definitely not as regular as it used to be. I thought it was just my diet, you know? Not enough fiber or something. I haven’t really paid much attention to it. Is that… important? It's embarrassing to talk about, I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: It is helpful that you shared that, Ms. Purtee. Given the constellation of symptoms – the altered body odor, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, night sweats, constipation – I believe a physical examination is warranted. Would you be comfortable with me proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I will begin with listening to your heart and lungs, and then we will proceed with a general abdominal examination. Please inform me if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper quadrants. No palpable masses or organomegaly detected. No acute abdominal findings, but the tenderness warrants further investigation. Now, Ms. Purtee, I’d like to check your thyroid.
PATIENT: Okay. That's fine. It doesn't hurt, just feels a little strange. I haven't really had anyone check my neck before.
DOCTOR: There appears to be a slight enlargement of the thyroid gland, although it’s subtle. Lymph nodes are not significantly enlarged, but there is a slight tenderness to palpation in the anterior cervical region. Given the findings of the examination – the thyroid enlargement, tenderness, and the constellation of symptoms you’ve described – I believe it is prudent to order some laboratory tests.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… serious? What kind of tests? And what do you think it could be? I'm getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It is not necessarily serious, Ms. Purtee, but it warrants investigation. We need to rule out certain possibilities. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a free T4 test. These tests will help us assess your overall health, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infections or metabolic imbalances. It could be a number of things, from a simple thyroiditis to something more complex. It's premature to speculate without the results. I will also order a urinalysis. We must be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay. That's… a lot of tests. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? And how long will it take to get the results back? I have work tomorrow, and I don't know if I can take a lot of time off. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: The tests are standard procedure, Ms. Purtee. For the blood work, you should fast for at least eight hours beforehand – no food or drinks other than water. The urinalysis requires a simple urine sample – you will receive a container from the nurse. As for the results, it typically takes 24 to 48 hours for the laboratory to process them. I will contact you as soon as they are available. I understand you have work commitments, Ms. Purtee, but your health is paramount. If the results are concerning, you may need to take some time off to undergo further evaluation.
PATIENT: Okay. Fast for eight hours, and a urine sample. I can do that. I’ll call work and see if I can get something arranged, just in case. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. Do you have any other instructions for me before I leave?
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Purtee. For now, simply follow the instructions for the laboratory tests. Avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, severe fatigue, or difficulty breathing – please contact my office immediately. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork for the laboratory and answer any further questions you may have. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
