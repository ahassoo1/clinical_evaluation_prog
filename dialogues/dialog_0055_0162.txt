DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re forty years of age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's my stomach, okay? Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a beach ball. It's been...a while. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Just…bloated. And uncomfortable. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: “A while,” is…not particularly helpful for medical assessment, Mr. Kristofik. But, alright. Bloated and uncomfortable. Can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's just…full. Like, really full. Pressure, I guess. Not painful, exactly. Just…there. And it doesn't go away. I eat, I don't eat, doesn't matter. It's always…present. I don't know what you want me to say? It's a stomach. It's bloated. Look, I work hard, okay? Pile driving all day, don't have time to worry about…feelings.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Mr. Kristofik. However, a comprehensive understanding of your symptoms is crucial for proper care. When did you first notice this fullness?
PATIENT: Honestly? No clue. Months, maybe? Look, my wife...she took care of all this stuff. Appointments, remembering dates… everything. It’s been…a while since then. Before that, I didn’t pay attention. It just…gradually got worse, I guess. Probably around…spring? Maybe? Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, "around spring." And has anything specifically worsened it?
PATIENT: Worsened it? Look, everything worsens it. Eating, not eating, standing, sitting… being alive, probably. I dunno. Certain foods maybe? Greasy stuff doesn't help, I guess. But I eat what I can when I can. It's not like I'm sitting down to a gourmet meal every night. Does it really matter? It's always there.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Kristofik. Diet can be quite indicative. Do you experience any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Look, you're asking a lot of questions. Nausea, no. Vomiting, no. Diarrhea… sometimes? Constipation… also sometimes? I mean, it's a stomach, right? Things go in, things come out. It's not exactly a predictable science, is it? I'm not a doctor, I just live with it. Can we just get a pill or something? Stop wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will need to palpate your abdomen. This will allow me to assess the extent of the bloating and identify any areas of tenderness.
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just…try not to poke too hard, alright? I've got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I’m going to press gently here. Let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Not pain, exactly. Just…full. Like pushing on a water balloon, I guess. It's always like that. Not specifically here, but everywhere. Stop, stop. You're pressing too hard. Seriously. It's uncomfortable, okay? I told you.
DOCTOR: Apologies. Alright. And here?
PATIENT: Same. It's all the same. Full. Pressure. Ugh. This is pointless. You're just poking my stomach. Look, I've been doing this job for twenty years. I've taken a few knocks, okay? Maybe it's just…old injuries? Or something? Can we just skip to the part where I get something for it?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is distended, with generalized fullness upon palpation. No acute tenderness to palpation, though patient reports discomfort. Auscultating bowel sounds now. Bowel sounds are…present, though somewhat diminished. Alright. I’m going to need to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And a stool sample is required as well. We'll check for any underlying inflammation or infection.
PATIENT: Blood work and…stool samples? Seriously? Look, I’ve got work tomorrow. I don’t have time for all this. Is this really necessary? Can’t you just give me something for the bloating and be done with it? This is ridiculous. . I'm leaving. I’ll just deal with it myself.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but a proper diagnosis is essential. Simply masking the symptoms without addressing the underlying cause could be detrimental to your health. While I appreciate your time is valuable, I strongly advise against dismissing these tests. Refusal of diagnostic testing could lead to a delayed and potentially serious diagnosis. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and stool sample. You can get these done at the lab across the street. I will need the results before I can formulate a treatment plan. However, I respect your autonomy. If you insist on foregoing the tests, I can offer a recommendation for an over-the-counter antacid, but please understand this is a temporary measure, and I advise you to return if your symptoms worsen. .
