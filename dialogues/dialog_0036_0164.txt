DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling quite unwell after eating fava beans. My skin and eyes have gotten really yellow, and I just feel… weak, generally. It started a few days ago, and it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mande. Feeling unwell after eating fava beans, with yellowing skin and eyes, and general weakness. That is concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when this started exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It was… last Friday, I believe. I had a small portion with dinner. Nothing huge, just as a side dish with some grilled fish. By Saturday morning, I started to feel a bit tired, but I didn’t think much of it. Then, yesterday, my husband noticed my skin looked… off. That’s when I really started to worry, and we decided to come in. It's definitely gotten worse since yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began last Friday with a small portion of fava beans, then fatigue on Saturday, and the yellowing of your skin became noticeable yesterday, and has been worsening. And just to confirm, is this the first time you’ve experienced this after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And… yes, it is the first time. I’ve eaten fava beans before, many times, actually – my grandmother used to grow them. Never had anything like this happen. It’s quite a shock, to be honest. It’s just… never happened before.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. A first-time reaction is significant. The yellowing of your skin—that’s jaundice—and the weakness, combined with the fava bean ingestion, is raising a concern for a condition called favism. However, we need to rule out other causes as well. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve always been fairly healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. I don’t have any ongoing conditions like diabetes or heart problems, and I haven’t been hospitalized for anything significant. I do take a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. I had my yearly check-up last November and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No significant medical history, just a daily multivitamin, and a normal check-up last November. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no other hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years, but nothing that required a visit to the hospital. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. It’s just… this is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit harder. My parents both passed away several years ago, and I wasn’t really close to my extended family. I know my father had some stomach problems when he was older, but I don’t know what exactly. And my mother… I think she had high blood pressure, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in their medical care, I'm afraid. I don’t know of anyone else with any serious illnesses. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mande. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. We’ll work with what we have. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, which is why this whole thing with the fava beans is so puzzling. I've never had a problem before. I've always been quite robust, honestly. This is very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to confirm, you mentioned a daily multivitamin. Can you tell me the name of it, or what's in it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s just a basic one, from the pharmacy. Let me see… it’s called “Daily Essentials,” and it has the usual things – Vitamin C, Vitamin D, B vitamins, zinc, things like that. Nothing specific, it’s just a general health supplement. I can bring the bottle in tomorrow if you’d like. I think I have the box somewhere…
DOCTOR: That's helpful. No need to bring the box in tomorrow unless you want to. Okay, Mande, thank you for that information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your skin and eyes more closely. We'll also check your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to figure out what’s going on, so do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Your skin does have a noticeable yellow tinge – jaundice, as we discussed. And your eyes are also quite yellow. Your abdomen feels soft, no pain when I press, and no swelling. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your liver function, red blood cell count, and a specific enzyme level called G6PD. This will help us determine if you have favism or another cause for your symptoms. We’ll also run a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s happening. G6PD… is that related to the fava beans? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, G6PD is directly related to the fava beans. It's an enzyme that protects your red blood cells. People with a G6PD deficiency are more susceptible to the effects of fava beans, as it can cause their red blood cells to break down, leading to jaundice and weakness. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. I'll call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods that might trigger a reaction. While we are waiting for the results, I’d like to ask you about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, but that’s it. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I've always been very careful about my health. I lead a pretty quiet life, honestly. Mostly just gardening and reading.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drug use. And what about your occupation?
PATIENT: I work as a receptionist at a small dental clinic. It's not very stressful, mostly just answering phones and scheduling appointments. I've been there for about ten years now. It keeps me busy, but it's not physically demanding. I'm thankful for the job, though. It helps me stay active and social.
DOCTOR: Okay, receptionist at a dental clinic. That sounds manageable. Alright, Mande, we’ve covered quite a bit. To summarize, you've experienced jaundice and weakness after eating fava beans, you have no significant medical history, family history is limited, you have no allergies, and you lead a healthy lifestyle. We’re running blood tests to check your liver function, red blood cell count, and G6PD levels. In the meantime, avoid fava beans. If you develop any new symptoms – such as dark urine, severe abdominal pain, or shortness of breath – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m just… anxious to get the results, naturally. But I feel reassured knowing we’re doing tests and trying to figure out what’s going on. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. I understand your anxiety, and we will get those results to you as soon as possible. I'll call you directly with the findings, and we can discuss the next steps. Here’s a copy of the lab requisition form and a brief summary of the instructions I gave you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before I call you with the results. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
