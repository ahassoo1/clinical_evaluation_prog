DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to have a baby, and I want it to be…easy, you know? No problems. My husband…well, he was a good man, and we always planned for kids, but…things happen. I just want to make sure I can have one now, without all the fuss. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. It’s perfectly alright to want to get straight to the point, and I’m very sorry for your loss. It’s completely natural to want things to go smoothly, especially after everything you’ve been through. "Easy" is a good goal, and we'll certainly work towards that. To help me understand what "fuss" might mean, and to see what steps we can take, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly, and do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly? Not really. I mean, I went for check-ups when I had to, but I’m generally healthy. No major illnesses or anything. A bit of…the usual woman stuff, you know? But nothing that needed constant attention. My husband always handled all that paperwork, and…well, now it’s just me. I don't really remember anything specific, if that helps. Is it important? Because I really don't have a list.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Carmaleta. It's understandable that you don't have everything at your fingertips, especially given the circumstances. It is important to get a good picture of your health, but we can work with what you remember, and I can also check our records to see if we have anything on file from previous visits. When you say "usual woman stuff," are you referring to regular menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Yeah, I guess. They were…regular enough. Look, I’m not one for getting into details. They came, they went. Nothing ever…scary. Just normal. Are you asking if I’ve had any problems down there? Because I really don't want to talk about it if that's what you're getting at. I just want a baby, not a lecture.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. I certainly don’t want to make you discuss anything you’re not comfortable with. “Regular” cycles are good to hear. Let me ask a different question then. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. That’s…that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? We…tried, for a while, but it never happened. It’s…embarrassing, I guess, to even say. My husband, he was always so optimistic, but…it just wasn’t meant to be, I suppose. And now…well, time isn't exactly on my side. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all to talk about this, Carmaleta. Many couples experience difficulties conceiving, and it’s perfectly normal to seek help. I commend you for taking this step. And you are right to be mindful of time. Knowing you haven’t been pregnant before is helpful. Before we move forward with planning, I’d like to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any reproductive issues in your mother or sisters?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly? I barely knew my parents, and my only sister lives in Ghana and we haven’t spoken in years. I really don’t know anything about their medical issues. My husband’s family was…healthy, I think? He had a lot of cousins, but I never really kept up with their ailments. I’m sorry, I’m not much help on that front. Is this really necessary? I just want to know if I can have a baby, not trace my lineage.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. It’s not always possible to have a detailed family history, and we can certainly proceed without it. It’s good to know. Okay, let's talk about you, then. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. You know, for general health. And I take something for…sleep. Just when I can’t get to sleep, which is a lot lately. It’s nothing prescribed, just something I buy at the store. Is that going to be a problem? I don't want to be put on a bunch of drugs if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. A multivitamin and an over-the-counter sleep aid are helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My husband always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Seriously, I'm a very healthy person, aside from…well, you know. Is this really going to take all day? I have appointments later.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And I understand your time is valuable, Carmaleta, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. Given your history, or lack of extensive history, and your desire to conceive, I think it would be best to do a basic physical exam and run some routine blood tests to assess your overall health and hormone levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I suppose I don’t have much of a choice. But please, no poking and prodding if you can avoid it. I really hate doctors. And no long waits, please. I have things to do. Just tell me what I need to do, and let's get this done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. I'll do my best to make this as comfortable and quick as possible. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. After that, I'd like to do a quick abdominal exam. It won’t be invasive, just a gentle check. Then we’ll get the blood tests ordered. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Just…get on with it. I’m ready when you are. But please, be gentle. And try not to make small talk, I really don't have the patience for it today.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Very good. Again…deep breath…and exhale. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m just going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Just hurry up. This is making me anxious. I really hate this. Is it going to hurt? I don't like feeling trapped.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is perfectly normal. I know this isn't comfortable, and I apologize for any anxiety it's causing you. It won't hurt. Now, just lie back on the examination table, and I'll do a quick abdominal exam. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. Everything feels normal so far. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, let's get the blood tests ordered. We’ll check your hormone levels, complete blood count, and a few other basic tests to get a better picture of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Just tell me where to go. Can I leave after that? I have a hair appointment, and I really can't be late. Hopefully this won’t take too long. Do I need to fast for these tests? I haven't eaten since breakfast.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for these tests, but you've already done that, so that's good. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The nurse will give you a requisition form, and they’ll take care of everything. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once you’re done, you can leave. Here's the requisition form, and the lab's phone number in case you have any questions. Once the results are back—usually in about a week—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just…please have the results ready quickly. I really want to get this over with. Thank you. Hopefully, everything is normal. I'm trusting you to get this done efficiently. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carmaleta. We’ll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you we’ll discuss everything thoroughly at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and I hope you enjoy your hair appointment. .
