DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, the nurse just told me it was somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ a little high. Found it on a routine check-up, I reckon. Didn't really understand all of it, to be honest. Thought I'd come in and get it straightened out. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Your primary care physician did order some bloodwork recently, and the results do indicate elevated cholesterol. Now, "a little high" can mean different things to different people. Let’s go over the specifics. Do you happen to know what your total cholesterol was, and if you recall any mention of your LDL, HDL, and triglycerides?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Numbers aren't my strong suit, never have been. I just… I let the doctors worry about the numbers. They said somethin’ about good and bad cholesterol, and I think the bad one was a little too high. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. I mostly just remember them sayin’ I needed to talk to someone about it. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I feel alright, mostly. A little stiff in the mornings, but that’s just gettin’ old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bohnett, it's good you're asking. Elevated cholesterol can be serious, but it's also very manageable. It's a bit frustrating when patients don't pay attention to the numbers, frankly. It’s a crucial part of understanding the risk. However, we can work with that. We'll get to the bottom of it. Let's start with a little background. Have you ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is a first. I’ve always been pretty healthy, you know? Worked hard all my life, outdoors mostly. Farmer, back in Sweden, then a carpenter when I came over here. Never really had much trouble with sickness. Just the usual aches and pains, like anyone else. I always ate… well, a normal diet, I guess. Meat and potatoes, vegetables from the garden, that sort of thing. Nothing fancy. Though, I do like my butter. Always have.
DOCTOR: I see. A generally active lifestyle, and a diet… traditional, let’s say. Butter is… relevant. Now, let's talk about family history. Did any of your parents or siblings have high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father… he was a strong man, worked hard like I said. Lived to be 85, I think. But I don't recall him ever bein' sick with anythin’ like that. My mother… she passed away when I was young, so I don't really remember much about her health. I had two brothers and three sisters, all back in Sweden. We haven't kept in touch much over the years, not since I moved here. I don't know nothin' about their health either, I'm afraid. I wasn't much for keepin’ track of things like that, even when I was younger. Family was… distant.
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited information regarding family history. Not ideal, but we’ll proceed. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir, not a one. I don't believe in takin' pills if I can avoid it. Always figured a good night’s sleep and a hard day’s work was the best medicine. Maybe a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. Oh! Except… the nurse gave me somethin' for my arthritis last year. A little orange pill. But I stopped takin’ it. Didn’t seem to do much good, and it upset my stomach. Can't remember the name of it, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, brief trial of an unspecified medication for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Never had a reaction to anythin' in my life. Used to pick wild berries back in Sweden, all sorts of 'em. Never had a problem. And I've been around cats and dogs my whole life, never had an allergy to animals either. I reckon I'm pretty lucky that way. Though, sometimes I get a bit of a sniffle when the pollen's bad in the spring. But that's just a regular cold, I suppose. Not a true allergy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Bohnett, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your extremities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I don't mind a bit. Just tell me if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I'm an old man, things don't move as quick as they used to. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another one… and out… Your heart rate is a little elevated, 82 beats per minute, and rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear, bilaterally, though a little diminished in the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Pulses are present, though a little weak in the lower extremities. Blood pressure is 148/88 mmHg. Slightly elevated blood pressure and weak pulses in the lower extremities noted. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh, my… is that bad, Doctor? The blood pressure, I mean. I always thought I had pretty good blood pressure. Always been a strong man, you know? Weak pulses… that doesn’t sound good either. Is that from the arthritis, maybe? I've been feelin' a little tired lately, now that you mention it. Especially in my legs. But I just figured it was gettin’ old. What does it all mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, your blood pressure is elevated, and the diminished pulses are concerning. While it could be related to your arthritis, we need to investigate further. Weak pulses in the extremities can indicate peripheral artery disease, which restricts blood flow to your legs and feet. Fatigue can be a symptom of that as well. We'll need to run some additional tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm going to order a lipid panel to re-evaluate your cholesterol levels, a complete blood count, and an Ankle-Brachial Index – that’s the ABI test – to assess blood flow in your legs. I also want to order an EKG to rule out any underlying heart issues given your slightly elevated heart rate.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… heart issues? Peripheral artery disease? That sounds… serious, Doctor. I don't want any fancy tests if I can avoid it, honestly. I'm an old man, I don't bounce back like I used to. Is it… is it expensive, all these tests? I'm on a fixed income, you know. And I don’t have insurance. Is there anything else we can do first? Maybe just… watch it for a while? I feel alright, mostly. A little tired, but that's just gettin’ old, like I said.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, while I understand your concerns, "watching it" is not an appropriate course of action given your symptoms and initial findings. Elevated cholesterol, elevated blood pressure, diminished pulses, and fatigue are all indicators of potential underlying cardiovascular disease. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to serious complications, such as heart attack or stroke. As for the cost, I understand your financial concerns. I will have the billing department contact you to discuss potential financial assistance programs and payment options. We can also prioritize the tests based on urgency. The ABI test is the most crucial one to start with, as it's relatively inexpensive and will provide valuable information about blood flow in your legs. I also recommend a consultation with a vascular specialist once we have the results. They can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and discuss potential treatment options. I'm going to order the ABI test and the lipid panel. We'll review the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you agree to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t like it, but… I suppose you’re right. Can’t just ignore it if it’s serious. I just… I don't want to spend a lot of money I don't have. And I don't want a lot of… pokein' and proddin', if you know what I mean. Alright, Doctor. Do the tests. The… ABI test and the… lipid panel. But please, let's try to keep it as simple as possible, and let me know about the cost before you do anything. And… and please, just explain things to me in plain English. No fancy medical terms, alright? Alright. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll put in the orders for the ABI and lipid panel. The nurse will schedule you for the ABI test. It's a non-invasive test that involves measuring blood pressure in your arms and legs. The lipid panel is a simple blood draw. The nurse will also go over the costs with you before proceeding. I will also have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks so we can review the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate you explainin’ it to me, even if it's not good news. And thank you for tryin’ to keep the costs down. I reckon I’ll be goin’ now, then. Stop.
