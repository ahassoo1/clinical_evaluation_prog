DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a telehealth visit, yes? My knees, they are… not so good anymore. They hurt when I walk. Especially when I stand for a long time.
DOCTOR: A telehealth visit?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I mean… I am here for a telehealth visit. I spoke on the phone, and the nice lady said I have appointment today. But… I am here, in the office. Is that… wrong?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Benites, it’s not wrong. It appears there's been a scheduling error. Someone booked you for an in-person appointment despite the initial request for telehealth. Regardless, we can proceed with an examination since you're here. Let's focus on your knees. You mentioned pain when walking, particularly with prolonged standing. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Okay, good. The pain… it is a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, usually. But if I walk too far, or stand while I am working on the car… it gets worse. Like a… heavy feeling. And sometimes, a little bit of clicking. Not loud, but I can feel it.
DOCTOR: A dull ache that worsens with activity, and some clicking… Alright. And where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Mostly on the front of the knee. But sometimes it feels… all around. It is hard to say exactly. Both knees are bad, but… this one is worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Both knees, but the right one is more bothersome. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. When I first get up in the morning, it is stiff and a little bit sore. Then, if I move around, it gets better. But then, after a while… if I am on my feet a lot, it starts to hurt again. It is… tiring.
DOCTOR: So, stiffness in the morning that improves with movement, then worsens with prolonged activity. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in either of your knees?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. And no redness. They look normal, I think. Maybe a little bit bigger than they used to be, but I don’t know if that is just… age?
DOCTOR: It's possible. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need to assess your range of motion and stability. Would you mind if I examined both knees?
PATIENT: No, no problem, Doctor. Both knees are fine. It is just… a little hard to get up here. Old knees, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time. Alright, Ms. Benites. I'm going to gently feel around your knees. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. That is a little bit sore. Not terrible, but… I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the medial joint line of the right knee. Now, can you please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this? It is… not so easy. It feels a little tight. And I can’t bend it all the way. Not like I used to. It… clicks a little when I do this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear and see a limited range of motion with some crepitus – that's the clicking sound. Now, I'm going to perform a few tests to check the stability of your knees. Please remain relaxed. I'm not detecting any significant instability in either knee, but the tenderness on the medial joint line and the limited range of motion are concerning. Let's review your medical history. Have you ever had any injuries to your knees, such as a sprain or fracture?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Never. I have always been careful. I work on cars, yes, but I am always careful. I think… maybe when I was young, I twisted it a little bit playing volleyball. But nothing serious. It didn’t hurt so much then.
DOCTOR: No significant knee injuries, possible minor twist while playing volleyball in the past. Alright. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as arthritis or diabetes?
PATIENT: Arthritis… my mother had arthritis in her hands. But I don’t think I have it. The doctor told me my blood sugar is a little bit high sometimes, but it is not… diabetes, he said. Just watch what I eat.
DOCTOR: Family history of arthritis, borderline high blood sugar. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Just… sometimes, I take something for the pain. But it doesn’t help much. Just a little bit. It is over-the-counter. The white pills. I forget the name.
DOCTOR: White pills… Over-the-counter. That is not particularly helpful information, Ms. Benites. Alright. Given your symptoms—the dull ache, tenderness on the medial joint line, limited range of motion, and clicking—it is likely you have osteoarthritis in both knees, although more pronounced on the right. It is often seen with age and can be exacerbated by activities like working on cars. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I recommend getting an X-ray of both knees. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… necessary? It sounds… serious. I just thought it was old age. Will it show me what is wrong? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, an X-ray is a simple imaging test. It doesn't involve any invasive procedures and is very low risk. It allows us to visualize the bones and joint space to assess for cartilage loss, bone spurs, and narrowing of the joint, which are typical signs of osteoarthritis. It will help us determine the extent of the condition and guide appropriate treatment. It does not hurt. It’s a brief exposure to radiation, but well within safe limits. It’s significantly more harmful to ignore the problem and potentially worsen the condition. I strongly recommend it. We can do it here in the clinic today. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think it is necessary… then yes. Do it. But please… be quick. I don't like being still for too long. And... tell me what you see, okay? I want to understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for the X-ray to be taken immediately. The technician will guide you through the process. It shouldn't take long. Once the images are taken, I will review them and discuss the findings with you. Please change into this gown. The technician will call your name shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will go change. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
