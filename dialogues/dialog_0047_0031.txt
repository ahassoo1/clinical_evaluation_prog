DOCTOR: Good morning, Miss Kreckel. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It’s been… bothering me a bit. And I know I have a funny heartbeat sometimes, the doctor told me about it a while back. It’s called… atrial… something? It feels a bit linked, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. Swollen leg and a history of…atrial fibrillation, was it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the word. Atrial… fibrillation. It happens now and then. Not all the time, but… enough to know about it, if you understand. I’m not entirely sure what it does, just that the doctor mentioned it before. Is the swelling something to be worried about, do you think?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when did you first notice the swelling in your leg?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe three days ago? It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just a bit bigger than usual at the end of the day. But yesterday and today it’s definitely worse. It’s… uncomfortable, mostly. Not terribly painful, just… heavy, you see?
DOCTOR: And is it just your left leg that’s swollen, or is it affecting the right leg as well?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. The right leg feels perfectly normal. It’s very strange, really. Only the left one is… puffy. And warmer, if that makes any sense. It feels warmer than my other leg, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any pain in your calf, redness, or any feeling of warmth along the leg at all, aside from just the feeling of it being warmer?
PATIENT: No, no redness at all. And the pain… it’s not really pain, more like a dull ache if I press on it. But not constantly, just… when I poke it. It’s hard to explain. Mostly just uncomfortable, like I said. I haven't noticed it getting warmer as such, it just feels warm compared to my other leg. Is that… odd?
DOCTOR: It’s… not typical. And you mentioned the atrial fibrillation. Have you been taking any medication for that, and have you noticed any correlation between the swelling and when you experience the irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything for it, Doctor. The doctor just told me to… keep an eye on it. And to come in if anything changed. And… now it has, hasn’t it? I think the leg is worse when my heart feels funny. But I’m not positive, it’s hard to tell. The heartbeat is… unpredictable. Sometimes it’s perfectly normal for days, then suddenly it’s all over the place again. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's…suboptimal. We’ll need to do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to check your pulses, feel the leg, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can discuss some possible causes and figure out what tests we need to run. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Is it alright if I… keep my shoes on? I’m not very good at balancing.
DOCTOR: Ideally, I’d like to assess your feet properly, but if it's difficult to balance, we can certainly work around it. Let’s start with your heart and lungs, and then we'll see how comfortable you are removing your shoes to check the pulses in your feet. Please lie flat on your back, and I'll listen with my stethoscope. Deep breaths, if you would.
PATIENT: Alright. Is this alright? I feel a bit silly lying here, but… I'm trying to breathe deeply like you asked. Just tell me if I’m doing it wrong. It’s a bit drafty in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is…irregular, as you've noted. There is a murmur present, but it’s difficult to assess fully in your current position. Your lungs are clear. Now, let's have a look at your leg. Can you point to where the swelling is most prominent?
PATIENT: It’s mostly here, Doctor. It’s a bit hard to tell, but it feels… bigger here than anywhere else. And warmer, still. I haven’t been able to feel if it's gone down, but I’m afraid it might be getting worse. Is it something… serious, do you think? I’m not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: There is some definite swelling present, and as you mentioned, the leg is warmer to the touch. There's also some pitting edema – that means the indentation remains for a few seconds after I press on it. Does this feel uncomfortable when I do that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s… a bit strange. Not painful, exactly, but… noticeable. Like a dull pressure, maybe? It doesn’t feel very nice, to be honest. Is that a bad sign, Doctor? I do hope it's nothing too serious. I haven’t been feeling very well lately, and I haven’t told anyone. I just thought it was… tiredness, you see.
DOCTOR: You really should have mentioned if you've been feeling unwell. Fatigue can be a symptom of many things, and it’s important to be thorough. Now, given your history of atrial fibrillation, the swelling in your leg, and the tenderness you’re experiencing, I suspect we’re dealing with either a deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot – or something related to heart failure. We need to rule out a DVT immediately. I’m going to order a D-dimer blood test and a Doppler ultrasound of your left leg to assess the blood flow. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A… blood clot? That sounds… frightening. No, I don't think I’m allergic to anything, Doctor. I’ve never had a test with dye before, as far as I know. I… I do get a bit faint sometimes, if that matters? It’s not very often, but… I’d rather not faint, if possible. What does this… dye do? And will it hurt? I’m awfully sorry to ask so many questions, but I’m a bit nervous now.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to ask questions, Miss Kreckel, but I wish you’d been more forthcoming with your other symptoms earlier. The dye is used in the ultrasound to help visualize the blood flow in your veins. It’s injected into a vein, usually in your arm. It can sometimes cause a warm sensation, but it shouldn’t be painful. The only reason I ask about allergies is because, rarely, some people have a reaction to it. As for the fainting, we’ll have you lie flat during the procedure and monitor your blood pressure closely. It’s unlikely you’ll faint, but we’ll be prepared. The most important thing right now is to rule out a blood clot, as that can be very serious. I’ll have a nurse draw blood for the D-dimer, and then we’ll schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. A blood test and then… a scan. I do apologize for not mentioning feeling unwell sooner. I didn't want to bother you. I’m a bit of a worrier, you see. So, just to be clear, the dye goes into my arm, and then you look at my leg with the scanner? And you’ll keep an eye on me, just in case I feel faint? That sounds… manageable. Should I avoid moving my leg until after the scan, do you think? I don’t want to make things worse. .
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. The dye goes in your arm, and then we’ll use the ultrasound to look at the blood flow in your leg. And yes, we'll monitor you closely for any adverse reactions or signs of discomfort. For now, try to avoid prolonged standing or straining your leg, but don't worry about restricting movement completely. I'll have the nurse explain the procedure and address any further concerns you may have. I’m going to order the tests now. Please remain seated, and I’ll be back shortly.
