DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Murtic, yes? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place. Need to find a doctor, you know? Medicare said to come. Social thing, I think. Not feeling bad, really. Just… new.
DOCTOR: Right. A “social thing.” Well, that’s… good to know you’re not actively ill at the moment. Still, Medicare doesn’t usually send people for check-ups just for the sake of it. Let’s do a basic assessment, shall we?
PATIENT: Assessment? Like… a test? I don’t like needles. Never have. My ex-wife… always wanted me to get the flu shot. Terrible woman. But no, no tests if it involves… poking. What kind of assessment are we talking about? Just… talking is fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I assure you I'm not trying to inflict pain. A basic assessment involves asking you questions about your medical history, any current medications, allergies… things like that. It's to get a baseline understanding of your health. No needles immediately. However, depending on what you tell me, some bloodwork might be necessary. It's standard procedure. Now, let’s start with the basics. Do you have any significant medical conditions – heart problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant? That’s a big word. I used to get heartburn. Bad heartburn. After spicy food. But that was years ago. And… my back. Always a little ache in my back. From… lifting things. Makeup is heavy, you know? All the lights and boxes. But nothing… serious. Never been to the hospital. Except when I broke my toe, but that was a long time ago. And it wasn't serious. Just stubbed it, really.
DOCTOR: Right. Spicy food and a stubbed toe. Let's focus on the back pain for a moment. Where exactly does it hurt?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… lower back. Right here. . Sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Not always, though. When I’m tired, mostly. Or if I’ve been carrying too much. Like I said, the makeup. It’s… a profession. Lots of lifting. And bending. Not what it used to be, you know? Used to do bigger shows. More… glamourous.
DOCTOR: And how long has this back pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. Decades, maybe? It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. When I was younger, I didn't even notice it. But now… well, now I'm older. Everything hurts a little more. I don’t remember exactly when it started. A long time ago. Before my divorce, definitely. She was a terrible woman. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take anything for the pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Oh. Sometimes. When it’s really bad. Just… ibuprofen, I think? The little white pills. Over the counter. I don’t take it very often. Don’t like pills. Make me feel… funny. And my stomach doesn’t like them. But sometimes, when I can’t sleep… a couple of pills. Not every night, though.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but that’s just the dust, probably. Or the cats. I like cats. My ex-wife didn’t like cats. Terrible woman. Never had a bad reaction to anything, though. Not that I remember. Never been to the hospital, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? I told you, just the back. And maybe heartburn. I don’t know… I just don’t go to the doctor. Never have. Always been healthy. Mostly. A little achy now and then, but who isn’t? This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is important, Mr. Szmyd. We need to establish a baseline. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Family? Oh… my mother passed away years ago. Lung… something. She smoked a lot. Terrible habit. My father… I don't remember. He left when I was very young. Never knew him. No brothers or sisters. Just me. Always been alone, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never liked it. Makes you smell bad. Drink… sometimes. A little vodka, maybe. When I'm alone. Just to relax. Not very much. And… recreational drugs? What does that even mean? No. Never. I'm a professional. Makeup artists don't… do that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your back. It won’t take long. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examination… table? Oh. Is it cold? I don't like being cold. And will I have to… take off my shoes? It's a long walk from the car, you know. But… alright. If you insist. Just… be gentle. And it better not be cold. .
DOCTOR: It is not cold. And no, you do not need to remove your shoes. Just lie down, please. I'll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Slightly elevated, but not critically high. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly faint. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, your back. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. Yes, there. . And here. It’s not sharp, just… achy. Like a dull… weight. It’s always been like that. I told you, lifting the makeup. It's heavy stuff. And bending. A lot of bending. Is something wrong? .
DOCTOR: There's some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region, with mild muscle spasm. Range of motion is slightly limited. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it appears you have chronic lower back pain, likely due to muscle strain from repetitive lifting and bending. It doesn’t sound like anything structurally severe, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some basic bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a sedimentation rate – to check for inflammation. I also want an X-ray of your lumbar spine to rule out any bone abnormalities. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear. Is that… safe? All that radiation… My ex-wife… always worried about radiation. Terrible woman. And bloodwork… lots of poking, I suppose? I don’t like poking. And what about the inflammation? Is that… serious? . What does all this mean? Am I… sick?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, the amount of radiation from an X-ray is minimal, and the benefits of ruling out serious pathology far outweigh the risks. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. And yes, the bloodwork involves a small needle prick, but it’s quick and relatively painless. As for the inflammation, it could be due to a number of things, and that’s why we need the blood tests. I am not saying you are “sick.” I am saying we need to gather more information to determine the cause of your back pain and ensure there’s nothing serious going on. This is basic preventative care. Here are the orders for the bloodwork and the X-ray. You can go to any lab and radiology center that accepts Medicare. Once you have the results, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Medicare. Yes. Follow-up appointment. . I… understand. I think. So, I go to the lab… and the radiology place… and then come back here? It sounds… complicated. And what if they find something… bad? . Is it going to be expensive? My ex-wife… always worried about money. Terrible woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, you go to the lab and the radiology center. They will handle everything. And we will discuss the results when you come back. I understand you're anxious, but we are simply taking precautions. Medicare should cover the majority of the costs, but you should verify with the lab and radiology center beforehand. I cannot answer hypothetical questions about what "if" they find something. We need to wait for the results first. For now, focus on getting the tests done. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Tests and… wait. . Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. . I hope it’s not too expensive. And I hope they don't poke too much. . .
