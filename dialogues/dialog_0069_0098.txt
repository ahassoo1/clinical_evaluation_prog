DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, to be honest, I just... wanted to check things out. Been feelin' okay, mostly. Just figured it couldn't hurt to see how things are lookin', you know? It's been a while since I had a proper check-up.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Demondre. Preventative care is important. So, “feeling okay, mostly” is good to hear. Can you tell me a little more about that “mostly”?
PATIENT: Well... I work on the boats, see? Sailor and oiler. It's good work, keeps me busy. Sometimes it's hard on the body, long hours and all. Mostly just tired, I guess. And my back gets a little sore sometimes, liftin' stuff. But nothin' I can't usually work through. It's just... been happenin' more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sailor and oiler – that is physically demanding work. And it sounds like you're someone who pushes through things. When you say your back soreness is happening more lately, can you describe that soreness?
PATIENT: It's... hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. Starts in my lower back, kinda spreads to my hips sometimes. Feels worse after a long shift, especially if I've been liftin' heavy stuff. It usually goes away after I rest, but it takes longer now to feel better. And it’s been… botherin’ me a little bit even when I am restin’. Just a kinda… stiffness. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache that radiates to your hips, worse with activity, and lingering even with rest… that gives me a better picture. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers the pain, besides lifting?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Well, sometimes if I'm sittin' for too long, it gets worse. Like, when we're waitin' on port or somethin'. But mostly it's just the liftin'. And bein' on my feet all day, I guess. It's hard to say exactly what sets it off, 'cause I'm always movin' or liftin' somethin' at work. It’s just kinda… always there a little bit, now. Not terrible, but… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this been a gradual onset, or did it start suddenly after a specific incident?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It didn't just happen one day. It started maybe six months ago, just a little bit of stiffness after work. I figured I just pulled somethin'. But it’s been gettin’ worse little by little since then. Didn't really think much of it 'til it started botherin' me even when I wasn't workin'. That’s when I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. That helps me understand the timeline. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions to get a broader picture of your health. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, sir. No numbness or tingly feelings. Everything feels normal down there, just… tired sometimes, after a long shift. But no weird feelings, no.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Uh... no changes there either. Everything's... regular, if you know what I mean. No problems with that. Sorry if that's too personal.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Demondre. It's important information. Okay, good. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever or chills. And I haven't lost any weight, not that I've noticed. I eat pretty good, gotta keep my strength up for work. Maybe I’ve gained a little, actually, with all the good food the cook makes on the ship. But definitely no weight loss.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all bases, do you have any history of any serious medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My mom had high blood pressure, but I haven’t been diagnosed with nothin'. I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, measles - but nothin’ serious. I had a broken arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up fine. I got Medicare, so they’d know if there was somethin’ on my record, right?
DOCTOR: That's right, Medicare would have a record of any significant medical history. But it's always good to double-check. And thank you for letting me know about the broken arm. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen sometimes, when my back's really botherin' me. And I take a multivitamin, just to make sure I'm gettin' enough vitamins. But that's it. Nothin' else. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Never had a reaction to nothin'. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she was allergic to cats, but that’s about as close as I get to allergies. Heh. Sorry, didn’t mean to bring that up.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Demondre. It's good to know. Alright, that covers the basic medical questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll check your back, hips, and legs to see if I can pinpoint the source of your discomfort. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's goin' on with my back. No problem at all. Where should I start?
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down on your stomach on the table, that would be a good start. I'm going to start by palpating your spine and surrounding muscles to check for tenderness or spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'll start gently, and we'll go from there.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Go ahead, Doctor. Let me know if I need to tell you anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just feeling along your spine and the muscles on either side. Can you tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness in a specific spot?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah... right there. That's a little sore. Not terrible, but... yeah, that's where it hurts the most. Like a dull ache, kinda radiates down my hip a little bit. Is that what you're lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It sounds like there’s some tenderness over the lumbar spine on your left side. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you gently bend forward, trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Whoa, that's… not as easy as it used to be. Feels kinda tight. I can get pretty close, but it's definitely stiff. And that kinda makes my back ache a little more. Here, is this what you want?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Yes, there's some limitation in your forward flexion. Now, can you try to bend backward, gently arching your back?
PATIENT: That's a little easier, but still not great. Feels kinda tight in my lower back. Not a lot of pain, just… stiffness. I can do it, but it doesn't feel right. Like somethin’s blockin’ me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed. I'm going to tap on your knees with this little hammer.
PATIENT: Okay, go ahead. Feels alright. Normal, I think. I haven't had any problems with my legs.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your legs. Can you please try to resist as I push down on your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m tryin’. Push away!
DOCTOR: Good. That feels normal as well. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on the physical exam, it appears you have some tenderness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. You also have some limitation in your range of motion, which is consistent with muscle strain or a minor spinal issue. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Muscle strain, huh? That sounds about right. I figured it was somethin' like that. So, what does that mean? Like, how long is this gonna last? And what can I do about it? Is it somethin' serious? I gotta get back to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, those are all good questions. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found in the exam, it doesn’t appear to be anything serious. Muscle strain is common with physically demanding work like yours. It means the muscles in your lower back have been overstretched or torn slightly. Most muscle strains heal with conservative treatment – that is, without surgery or other invasive procedures. It could take a few weeks to a few months for the pain to fully subside, depending on the severity of the strain. For now, I recommend rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you’re already taking. I’d also suggest avoiding heavy lifting and bending as much as possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest, ice, ibuprofen... yeah, I can do that. But avoidin’ heavy liftin’… that’s kinda hard on a boat, you know? Is there somethin’ else I can do? Like, maybe some stretches or somethin’? And what if it doesn’t get better? What then? I don't want this to become a long-term problem. Is there any way to prevent this from happenin' again?
DOCTOR: You’re right, avoiding heavy lifting completely on a boat isn’t realistic. We'll focus on modifying your activities. Try to use proper lifting techniques – bend your knees, keep your back straight, and hold the load close to your body. And take frequent breaks. Here’s a pamphlet with some basic stretches and exercises you can do to strengthen your back and core muscles. These can help prevent future injuries. If the pain doesn’t improve within a few weeks, or if it gets worse, we may need to consider further evaluation, such as an X-ray or MRI to rule out any other underlying issues. We can also discuss a referral to physical therapy if you’d like. A physical therapist can teach you proper body mechanics and give you a personalized exercise program. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Proper liftin', stretches, and maybe physical therapy if it doesn't get better. I can try that. And X-rays if I need ‘em. I appreciate you explainin' it all so clearly, Doctor. One more question… will this affect my ability to work? Like, will I be able to keep my job? My boss is a good guy, but I don’t wanna be a burden.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Demondre. I don’t anticipate this preventing you from working altogether, but it’s important to listen to your body and avoid activities that aggravate your pain. I can write you a note for your employer explaining your condition and any limitations you may have. We can tailor the note to specifically address your work duties and suggest modifications to help you continue working safely. It’s also important to communicate openly with your boss about your pain and any limitations you may be experiencing. This note outlines your condition and suggests avoiding heavy lifting and prolonged bending. It also recommends using proper lifting techniques and taking frequent breaks. Does that address your concerns about your job?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's perfect, Doctor. Thank you. That note will really help. I feel a lot better now, knowin' what's goin' on and what I can do about it. I think I'm good to go for now. Thanks again for your time and help. I really appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body, follow the recommendations, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or if your pain worsens. Get well soon, and stay safe out there.
