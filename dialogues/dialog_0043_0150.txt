DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I’m Angelle Shteynberg. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure it… happens easily. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve heard some… stories. I want to avoid problems. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. It's wise to be proactive, and I commend you for coming in to discuss this. We’ll certainly do everything we can to help make this process as smooth as possible. To begin, could you tell me a little about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep a calendar. I know when they happen. They’re… regular enough. What do you need to know, exactly? Are you going to ask me about… details? Because I really don’t feel comfortable getting into all of that with a stranger. Just… are they normal? Yes. They happen every month. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize if my question was too direct. You are absolutely right to set boundaries. "Regular enough" is a good starting point. To help me assess things further, could you give me a rough estimate of how often they occur—perhaps every 28 days, or closer to a month, or a bit longer?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s usually… around four weeks. Sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more. It depends. I travel, you know. Things get… disrupted. It's not like I'm a machine. Is that what you want to know? A precise, robotic schedule? Because that’s just not realistic. And frankly, I don't see why that's even relevant if I'm perfectly healthy otherwise.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Shteynberg. It's helpful to have a general idea, and “around four weeks” is a good start. Travel can certainly affect cycles, and I appreciate you sharing that. Irregularity, even if mild, can sometimes impact conception, so it’s good to be aware of. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in the length of your cycles recently, or in the amount of bleeding?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I’m not going to sit here and dissect my… womanly functions with you. It's the same, generally. Sometimes a little heavier, sometimes a little lighter. It fluctuates! It depends on the stress level, the weather, what I ate… honestly, it's not a science experiment. I'm a healthy woman. I eat well. I exercise. I don't smoke. I’m not riddled with diseases. Why are you asking me these… elementary questions? I want to know what tests I need, not give you a month-by-month report on my… personal life.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Shteynberg, and I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable. I assure you, I'm not trying to pry into your personal life. My goal is simply to gather the necessary information to ensure we can approach this in the best possible way. You are right to focus on what tests might be helpful. Before we discuss those, may I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Fine. Get it over with. But if it involves anything… invasive, I’m walking out. I have a business to run, you know. I don't have time for endless poking and prodding. And I certainly don’t have time to explain every childhood illness I ever had. Just… be quick. Do you need my insurance card? Because I have Medicare, and I’m not sure what paperwork you require.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Medicare is perfectly fine, and we can take care of the paperwork in just a moment. I certainly won’t ask for anything invasive without a clear explanation of why it’s necessary. Let’s start with some basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions—things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I’m healthy. I get regular checkups. My doctor always says I’m in excellent shape for my age. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself. I'm a very active person. I run a business, remember? You don't run a business if you're constantly sick. Frankly, I’m starting to think this is a waste of my time. Are you going to actually do something, or just keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg, and I appreciate you sharing that. It’s good to know you are generally healthy and active. To rule out any potential issues, even those you may not be aware of, it would be helpful to get a basic blood panel. This can check things like your hormone levels, thyroid function, and overall blood count. It’s a standard part of fertility assessment and doesn't require any invasive procedures. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? Now there's a surprise. Fine. A blood panel. Get it over with. But if it involves going to some horrible lab with… unsavory characters, I’m drawing the line. I prefer a reputable facility. And I want the results quickly. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for weeks. And please, no lectures about my… age. I’m perfectly aware of it. Just do the test and tell me what it says.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, we use a very reputable lab—it's located just down the hall. And we'll expedite the results as much as possible—you should have them within a few business days. I will also refrain from any lectures regarding age. While we're waiting for the results, it would be helpful to gather some information about your family history. Have there been any instances of early menopause or infertility in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, Doctor, my family is… complicated. There’s been everything. Early deaths, late marriages, plenty of… disagreements. I’m not even sure I know the full history. My mother didn't exactly share everything. And frankly, I don’t see how that’s relevant to my ability to have a child. I'm a strong, healthy woman. I’m not going to be affected by some distant relative’s… problems. I'm going to stop you right there. This is getting ridiculous. I’m leaving. Tell me when the blood test results are ready. And make sure it's quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly expedite the blood work. Our staff will contact you as soon as the results are available. If you change your mind about discussing your family history or any other medical information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day.
