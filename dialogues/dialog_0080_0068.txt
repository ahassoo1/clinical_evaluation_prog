DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it's my legs, mostly. They are… puffy. After the cancer stuff, you know? It’s been a few months now, and they just don’t seem to go back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Puffy” – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, like… bigger. And kinda hard feeling. Not painful, usually. Just… not my legs. They feel heavy too, if I stand too long. It's mostly in my ankles and calves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so swelling in your ankles and calves, mostly, that's been going on for a few months now after your cancer treatment. And it feels heavy if you stand for a while. Not painful, just…different. Have you noticed it getting worse, better, or staying about the same?
PATIENT: Staying the same, I think. Maybe a little worse when it's hot, but not much. It doesn't really go away. I wear support stockings sometimes, but they don’t seem to do much good either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be clear, when you say “cancer stuff,” could you remind me what type of cancer you were treated for, and what treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, of course. It was… breast cancer. About two years ago, now. I had… the surgery, to take it out, and then… the chemo. And radiation. Lots of radiation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so breast cancer treatment with surgery, chemo, and radiation, completed about two years ago. And the leg swelling started a few months ago. Has anything else changed since the swelling started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Maybe I get a little more tired, but I was already pretty tired from everything. Oh! And my skin feels a bit dry, especially on my legs. But that could just be the weather, no? It’s been very warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more fatigue and some dry skin on your legs, in addition to the swelling. Do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, no. Nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, you know? I walk when I can, but… not as much as I used to. The doctor always said my blood pressure was good. And no… sugar problems either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just… a little thing for my bones. Something the doctor gave me after the cancer. It's a pill. And sometimes I take something for sleeping, when I really can’t sleep. But that’s it, I think. Oh! And a vitamin D, because the doctor said I was low.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get a little more specific. What's the name of the pill for your bones?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I don’t remember! It’s… a white pill. Small. The doctor just said it was to make my bones strong. I get it every month. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with names.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. We can look it up. Before we do that, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had one. I eat everything! Except maybe oysters, but that's just because I don't like them, not because I'm allergic.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And just a little wine with dinner, sometimes. Very little. And definitely no… other things. I’m a good girl!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that gives me a good start. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your legs and ankles?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. It's probably nothing, but it’s good to check, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, there is some swelling, as you mentioned, and it feels… firm. I’m not getting much pitting when I press, which is good. Your skin looks normal color, no redness or warmth, and no pain when I touch. Your pulses feel strong, which is also good. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to get a baseline. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to check your blood pressure and a few other things. Do you have a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, never. Not that I know of. Why do you ask?
DOCTOR: Just a routine question, Sasha. It helps rule things out. We're looking for causes of swelling in your legs, and blood clots are one possibility, although it doesn't sound like that's the case here, given what I’m finding. I’m going to order a simple blood test to check your kidney function and a D-dimer, which helps rule out blood clots. It’s a standard precaution. We should also get an ultrasound of your legs to check the valves in your veins. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a lot. But, okay. If it will find out what’s wrong. Valves? What are valves? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It can be serious, but it doesn’t mean it is. Valves are like little doors inside your veins that keep the blood flowing in one direction – back to your heart. Sometimes, after cancer treatment, or if you stand a lot, these valves can get weak, and blood can pool in your legs, causing swelling. The ultrasound will show us if that’s happening. The blood test will just make sure your kidneys are working properly, because that can also cause swelling. It's all just information gathering at this point. The nurse will come in and draw some blood, and then we’ll schedule the ultrasound. Do you have any questions for me before we do that?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I understand. It’s just… a lot. But okay. Ultrasound and blood test. Thank you, Doctor. That's… good. You're very thorough. I think that’s all I need right now. I would like to go home. .
DOCTOR: Alright Sasha. We'll get those tests ordered for you right away. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs when you can, and continue wearing the support stockings, even if they're not providing much relief – they can still help a little. Here’s a note for work/school explaining your appointment and the need for the tests. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they come in, usually within a day or two. If you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your legs, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
