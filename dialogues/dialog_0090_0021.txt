DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, my foot's been botherin' me. It's mostly my right one, and it's gotten pretty swollen. It's not a sudden thing, it's been buildin' up for…oh, I’d say a couple of weeks now, maybe three.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, alright. And it's just the right foot, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, just the right one. The left one's fine, thank you goodness. It started kinda achy after I was on my feet a lot, you know? I work, doin' paperwork at the loan place, so I sit most of the time, but sometimes gotta walk around with files and things. It just got worse from there, the achin' turned to swellin'.
DOCTOR: Paperwork, alright. And when you say “worse,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just achy now. It feels…full, if that makes sense? Like there's somethin' pushin' out from inside. And it’s kinda tender to the touch. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache that gets worse if I press on it. And it’s warm, warmer than my other foot, I think. I haven’t been able to wear my normal shoes, gotta wear somethin’ looser.
DOCTOR: Warm, you say. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your foot, or any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm, color... now that you mention it, maybe a little bit reddish? It’s hard to tell, my skin’s a bit darker, you know? And no, no numbness or tingly feelings. Just the swellin’ and the warmth and the ache. It’s mostly just uncomfortable, to be honest. Makes it hard to get around, even just to the store.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you injured your foot recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I definitely didn’t twist it or anything like that. It just…started. Gradual, like I said. I’m pretty careful, I don't go doin' anything crazy. Mostly just work and a bit of walkin' to the market. I do remember standin' a long time a couple weekends ago helpin' my neighbor carry some boxes, but that was a couple weeks before the swellin' started.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Just let me know if I need to move it or anything. This old body doesn’t always cooperate, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to gently feel around your foot and ankle. Please let me know if anything is particularly tender. Hmm... yes, there is definite swelling around your ankle and midfoot. And it is warm to the touch, as you mentioned. I also notice some redness around your instep. Let me check your range of motion… There is some discomfort with dorsiflexion – that's when I bend your foot upward. No crepitus, thankfully. Okay. It does appear you have some inflammation in your right foot. Is there any pain in your calf muscle?
PATIENT: Calf muscle... Hmm, let me think. Not a sharp pain, but it's kinda tight. Been feelin' a bit of tightness there, especially in the evenings. I figured it was just from bein' on my feet at work, didn't think much of it. Now that you ask, though, yeah, it is a bit tight. It doesn't really bother me unless I try to stretch it, then it feels kinda pulled.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to rule a few things out. Given the swelling, redness, warmth, and the tightness in your calf, it's possible this could be a blood clot, a deep vein thrombosis – DVT. It’s not necessarily likely, but we have to be thorough. We’ll need to get an ultrasound of your leg to check for that. We’ll also do some blood work to rule out any infection. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you elevate your foot as much as possible, and I’m going to have you start on a blood thinner – just a preventative measure until we get the results back. It’s called Xarelto. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. A blood clot? That sounds serious! I… I never had anything like that before. And a blood thinner? That sounds kinda scary too. Is it somethin' really bad? I just thought it was maybe a sprain or somethin'. Xarelto… what does that even do? I feel a bit worried now, to be honest. I just wanted somethin’ for the swellin'.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Parascandola. It is better to be cautious. A DVT, if left untreated, can be serious, but they’re also very treatable, especially if caught early. That's why we're running these tests. Xarelto is a medication that helps prevent blood clots from forming or getting bigger. It won’t hurt you, but it does require some monitoring, just to ensure the dosage is correct. We’ll discuss all of that in detail if the ultrasound confirms a clot. Right now, we're just taking precautions. We’ll get that ultrasound scheduled right away. And I’ll explain everything the lab work involves as well. In the meantime, please try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Elevate your foot whenever possible, and apply ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… ice and keep it up, got it. And no standin’ or sittin’ too long. The ultrasound… is it gonna hurt? And what about the blood work? Do I have to fast or somethin’? I don't really like needles. And… if it is a blood clot, what happens then? Do I have to go to the hospital? I know I'm askin' a lot, it’s just… it’s kinda scary hearin’ all this. Just wanted somethin’ for my foot!
DOCTOR: Mr. Parascandola, I understand your anxiety, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. The ultrasound is completely painless – it uses sound waves, not radiation. As for the blood work, yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. I’ll give you a slip with specific instructions. Now, if the ultrasound reveals a clot – and again, we don’t know that yet – you may require further treatment, which could involve a hospital stay, depending on the severity. Most clots are treated with medication, but in some cases, other procedures might be necessary. I will explain everything in detail if that happens. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. I will have my nurse schedule the ultrasound and give you the blood work instructions. And please, try to remain calm. Worrying won’t help, and it’s unlikely to be as serious as you’re imagining. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Eight hours…okay, I can do that. And the nurse will schedule it? Good. I… I guess not, not right now. Just… get the tests done, right? Try not to worry? Easier said than done. Alright. Let’s just get it over with. What time should I be here for the fastin’ blood work? And… should I wear loose shoes? Everything seems kinda important all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should wear loose shoes to the appointment. As for the blood work, the lab opens at 7 am. We’ll schedule you for first thing in the morning, which is best when fasting. My nurse will provide you with all the specifics. And Mr. Parascandola, please try to relax. It's likely nothing more than a simple strain, but we need to be thorough. The nurse will be in shortly with the appointment information. Is there anything else I can address before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just the nurse, then. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ everything, even if it is a bit scary. Hopefully it is just a strain, like you said. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will see what the tests show. .
