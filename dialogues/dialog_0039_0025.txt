DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… I want to know more about where my people come from. My family, that is. I hear you can do a test with… with spit? To find out. I want that test.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes! You’re talking about ancestry testing. It’s becoming more popular. It does involve a saliva sample. It can give you some interesting information about your family's origins… though, it's not always a complete picture, you understand. Just to be clear, are you wanting to know about your medical history too, or is this primarily about your family's heritage?
PATIENT: No, not sick history. Just… where we come from. My grandpa… he talk stories about the islands. Marshall Islands. But I forget a lot now. I want to know for sure. Is that okay? Will Medicare pay for this?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly okay, Mr. Scobie. Knowing your heritage is important. Let me see… Medicare may cover some genetic testing if it’s medically necessary – meaning it’s helping to diagnose or prevent a health condition. But ancestry testing, just for knowing origins, usually isn’t covered. We can check with them to be sure, of course. There are also direct-to-consumer ancestry tests available – companies like 23andMe or AncestryDNA. Those you would pay for out-of-pocket. Before we decide on testing, could you tell me a little more about what you’re hoping to learn?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t know those names. 23 and… the other one. I just want to know if my grandpa’s stories are right. He say we from a small island. Ratak Chain, I think he say? And he say we good fishermen. I just… want to know. Is the test… hard? Do I need to drink something bad? I don't like those tests.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Scobie. It’s not like a blood test or anything like that. The test is very simple. You just spit into a little tube. It’s completely painless! And no, you don’t have to drink anything bad. It's very straightforward. Here, let me show you. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… easy. Just spit? That’s good. But… what if I don’t have enough spit? Sometimes my mouth is dry. And… what happens after you get the spit? Do they call me on the phone? I don't like phone calls.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Scobie. If you don’t have enough spit right away, they’ll give you instructions on how to stimulate saliva production. Usually just by gently chewing or thinking about food. They'll provide a kit with detailed instructions. And no, they usually don't call. The results are typically sent to you online, through a secure website. We can help you set that up, and I can go over the results with you here in the office if you’d like. That way, you don’t have to worry about phone calls. Before we proceed, do you have any family members who might also be interested in this?
PATIENT: No, just me. My brother… he passed away a long time ago. And my sister… she no like these things. She say it’s better to just remember the stories. But I want proof. So, how much this test cost? If Medicare no pay.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. It's perfectly reasonable to want to verify those stories. Let me see… these tests usually range from about $99 to $199, depending on the company and the level of detail they provide. Some offer more in-depth reports for a higher price. We can look at a few different companies together, compare their services, and see which one might be the best fit for you. And again, we can always double-check with Medicare to see if any portion of the cost might be covered. Before we do that, let’s quickly review your medical history, just to make sure there aren’t any contraindications to genetic testing. Have you had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, never. Just regular check-ups. Blood pressure, you know. Doctor say I good for my age. No problems. I just want to know about my islands. My people. That’s all. Can we just… look at the test now? The one with the spit.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Scobie. That's perfectly fine. Let's focus on the ancestry test then. Here we are. 23andMe offers a basic ancestry report, as well as health predisposition reports. AncestryDNA focuses more on tracing your family history and connecting you with potential relatives. They both use a simple saliva sample. Do either of those sound more appealing to you at first glance?
PATIENT: Hmm… the one with the family… that sounds nice. Maybe find other people from my islands? The pictures… they show people with dark hair, like me. Is that the Ancestry one? Can they tell me what island my grandpa came from?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the AncestryDNA one. They specialize in building family trees and connecting you with relatives who have also taken the test. It’s more likely you’d find people with similar ancestry through them. They can’t pinpoint the exact island your grandpa came from, unfortunately. But they can give you a very detailed ethnicity estimate – showing what percentage of your DNA comes from different regions of the world, including the Marshall Islands. They have a pretty extensive database for Pacific Islander ancestry. It can sometimes narrow it down to specific island chains. Would you like me to show you a sample report, so you can see what kind of information they provide?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Show me the report. I want to see what it looks like. And… how long does it take to get the spit back? I don't want to wait too long. I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Here we are. As you can see, it breaks down your ancestry into percentages. For example, it might say 60% Pacific Islander, 20% East Asian, and so on. They also provide information about the historical origins of those populations. And here, you can see potential relatives who have also taken the test. As for turnaround time, it usually takes about 6-8 weeks to receive your results, from the time they receive your saliva sample. They have to process it in their lab, analyze the data, and generate the report. It might be a little longer if there's a high volume of samples. I know that’s a bit of a wait, and I apologize for that. If you’re concerned about the delay, we can explore other options, although they may not be as comprehensive. Would you like me to go over the privacy policy with you before we proceed?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks… that’s a long time. But… it sounds good. I want to see if it can find my people. The privacy thing… is my spit safe? Will they sell it to other people? I don’t want my spit going around.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Scobie. Privacy is very important. AncestryDNA has a strict privacy policy. They do not sell your spit to other people. Your DNA data is stored securely and is only used for ancestry research. Here, you can see it outlined in their terms of service. They do allow you to download your raw DNA data, and you can choose to share it with third-party researchers if you want, but it’s completely optional. They also allow law enforcement access under very specific legal circumstances, but they’re required to have a warrant. I understand your hesitation. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can definitely explore other options, or simply postpone the testing. Would you like me to explain the process of ordering the kit and setting up an account?
PATIENT: Okay. Explain the ordering thing. If it’s not too complicated. I’m not good with computers. And… can you help me set up the account? I don't want to give them my wrong number.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. I’m happy to help you every step of the way. It’s not complicated at all. First, you’ll need to create an account with your email address and a password. Then, you’ll select the AncestryDNA kit and enter your billing information. It costs $99 plus shipping and handling. They’ll ask for your name, date of birth, and gender. It’s important to use accurate information, as this helps them find potential relatives. You can also choose to share your ethnicity estimates with other AncestryDNA users, or keep them private. I can sit with you and help you fill out the form if you like. And I can double-check that you're entering the correct information. We can use your phone number, but you don't have to. They mainly use it for account recovery if you forget your password. We can also use my email address for the account if you prefer. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good. Use your email. I always forget my passwords. And… can we do it now? Before I forget. I’m here, I got my insurance card… let’s just get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Let's get started right away. We can complete the order together now. First, we'll create an account using my email address. Then, we'll select the AncestryDNA kit and enter your payment information. It's important to double-check everything before submitting the order. Okay, now let's enter your name and date of birth… and here's where we'll enter your payment information. It's perfectly secure, I assure you. Alright, everything looks good. Are you ready to submit the order?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s do it. Get it over with. And thank you, Doctor. You’re a big help. I don’t know what I’d do without you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m happy to help. Okay, the order is submitted! Here’s your order number, and they estimate the kit will arrive in about 5-7 business days. Once the kit arrives, you’ll simply follow the instructions to collect your saliva sample and mail it back to their lab. It will take about 6-8 weeks to receive your results. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I just want to know about my islands now. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. I hope you receive some good news about your islands soon. It was lovely meeting you. Take care now, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
