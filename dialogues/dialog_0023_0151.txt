DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this… tingling. In my hands mostly, and sometimes my feet. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's just… annoying, you know? It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… feels like pins and needles. I'm Teretha, by the way. Just Teretha is fine.
DOCTOR: Right. “Just Teretha.” Well, Ms. Uzarski—er, Teretha— tingling, you say. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe three, four months now? It comes and goes, it’s not constant. Some days I barely notice it, other days it's… well, more noticeable. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I've been busy with the mail route. It’s been a hot summer, too. Could be that.
DOCTOR: A mail route, yes. And you believe the heat might be a factor?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t know, do I? But it’s awfully hot out there, and I’m on my feet all day. It makes my hands and feet swell a bit sometimes, and when that happens, the tingling feels worse. I just thought I’d mention it. It’s probably nothing, really. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: “Wasting my time” is not a productive thought, Teretha. We are here to assess your concerns. Now, let's be precise. When you say it feels worse when your feet swell... does the swelling happen before the tingling, during the tingling, or after?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, goodness. I hadn't really thought about when exactly. Let me see… I think… it usually swells before. Yeah, definitely before. I notice my ankles are getting puffy, then the tingling starts. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things. I'm just a mail carrier, not a doctor!
DOCTOR: It's… adequate. And you mentioned this occurs in both your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though it's worse in my hands, I think. Makes it hard to sort the mail sometimes, you know? Dropping things. It’s embarrassing, and I don't want to be that mail carrier. But it’s not all the time. Just… when it’s bad. And like I said, some days I don't even notice it. It comes and goes. I just wanted to get it checked out, to be safe.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. Not really. Not that I’ve noticed. I can still carry all the mail, and I still make the route on time. Maybe a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s just from the walking, I think. I haven’t dropped anything too often, just… fumbled a bit. Does that count as weakness? I don’t know… I’m probably just worrying over nothing.
DOCTOR: Teretha, we are attempting to determine the cause of your symptoms. “Worrying over nothing” is not helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color, specifically in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh! Skin color… Now that you mention it… sometimes my hands look a little… pale. Especially when it’s cold. Not always, just… sometimes. And maybe my feet too, but I don’t really look at my feet much, to be honest. They’re just… feet. Are you looking for anything specific? I'm getting a little anxious, Doctor. This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Anxious, yes. Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not that I remember. Nothing major, anyway. I might have bumped my hand on the mail truck a few times, but nothing serious. Just little things. A scrape here and there. Nothing that would cause… tingling. I've been a mail carrier for twenty years, Doctor, I get bumps and scrapes all the time! It’s part of the job. Is this going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. It’s a long story.
DOCTOR: We will address the cost later, Teretha. For now, we are focusing on your health. Have you noticed any numbness accompanying the tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's a good question. Sometimes, yes. Not all the time, but sometimes my fingers feel… sort of numb. Like they’re asleep. And my toes, too. It doesn't last long, usually. Just a few minutes. Then it goes away. But it's there sometimes, with the tingling. It’s hard to grip things when they’re numb. That’s why I’m worried, I guess. This has been going on long enough that I thought I should get it checked.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will need to perform a brief neurological examination and check your circulation. Please extend your arms, palms up. I will assess your reflexes and strength. And then, please lie down on the examination table so I can assess your lower extremities.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm not very good at these things. And… is this going to take long? I have a route to finish, you see. It’s a lot of walking.
DOCTOR: It will be as efficient as possible, Teretha. Relax your arms. And do not anticipate the tap. Now, squeeze my fingers. Hard. Let's see what we're working with. Your grip is… adequate. Now, let's move on to your feet. Please turn over onto your back.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a little hard on my knees. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem… very busy. I don’t want to take up too much of your time. Just tell me if it’s nothing, okay? I really need to get back to work. My supervisor is very strict.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are… diminished. Now, I will need to assess sensation. Please tell me when you can feel this. Tell me when you feel the touch. And be precise. Is it sharp?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel it now. It’s… dull. Not sharp. More like… pressure. It's hard to describe. It feels… faint. Especially in my toes. And my fingers feel a little numb again. Is something wrong, Doctor? You haven’t said anything, and it’s making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Well, Teretha, your symptoms are… suggestive. It appears there is some degree of peripheral neuropathy. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and… sometimes, it’s idiopathic—meaning we don’t know the cause. I recommend a comprehensive blood workup to rule out underlying medical conditions. Specifically, we need to check your glucose levels, vitamin B12, and thyroid function. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh! Diabetes? No, no. Never. My mother had high blood pressure, but not diabetes. I eat pretty healthy, I think. Lots of fruits and vegetables. I just walk a lot! That’s supposed to be good for you, right? A blood test… that sounds expensive. And… does this mean something’s seriously wrong? I’m getting scared, Doctor. I just wanted to know why my hands and feet were tingling!
DOCTOR: “Seriously wrong” is a subjective term, Teretha. It could be a minor vitamin deficiency, or it could indicate a more significant underlying issue. The blood work will provide clarity. As for cost, I will need to refer you to a lab. They can discuss payment options with you. Let me write the order… I will also recommend a consultation with a neurologist for further evaluation, should the blood work be inconclusive. They are specialists in these matters. Here is the order. Schedule the appointment as soon as possible. And I recommend avoiding prolonged standing if possible, to minimize your symptoms. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… No… no, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… is there anything I can do right now to make it stop tingling? It’s hard to sort the mail when I can’t feel my fingers. I just want to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. As for immediate relief, over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen, may provide some temporary symptom management. However, these are merely palliative measures, Teretha. They do not address the underlying cause. If the pain becomes unbearable, you can visit the emergency room. Schedule the blood work and the neurologist appointment as soon as possible. And please, try not to dwell on it. Next patient!
