DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. I have… how you say… a pain. In the back of my head. It hurts sometimes, not all the time. It started… maybe two weeks ago? I don't remember exactly, but around then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pain in the back of your head, starting about two weeks ago. That’s good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… is like… a pressure. Not so much sharp, you understand? More… heavy. Like someone is sitting on the back of my skull. And sometimes it feels like it goes up a little, to the sides. Not always, though. It is worse when I… when I think too much, maybe? Or when it is very hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pressure, not sharp, more heavy, sometimes radiating to the sides, and worse with thinking or heat. That helps me get a better picture. Does anything relieve the pain – like, does lying down help, or taking any medication, maybe?
PATIENT: Medication? No, I don’t take anything. I am too old for that, I think! Lying down… sometimes. But not always. Sometimes it is better just to… sit still. And drink water. Water helps a little. But it comes back. The pain, I mean. It always comes back.
DOCTOR: Alright, so lying down or sitting still and water provide some relief, but it returns. Have you noticed anything else happening with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… yes. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And my eyes… they feel tired. Like I haven't slept, even when I have. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Dizziness and eye fatigue alongside the headache are definitely things we need to consider. Have you had any changes in your vision at all – blurry vision, seeing spots, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no blurry. I see… okay, I think. Old man eyes, you know? Not so good as when I was young, but not blurry. No spots either. Just… tired. Like they have been working very hard. Everything looks normal, just… tired. Is like looking through a dirty window, maybe? Not the window itself, but… the eyes. They feel dirty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in vision quality just a feeling of fatigue, like they’re working hard. And you mentioned the dizziness is mild – just feeling lightheaded?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Lightheaded. Not spinning. And it doesn’t last long. Maybe a few minutes. It comes and goes. Like everything else. Is like… a little cloud passing over the sun. Then it is gone. But it comes back later. The headache is the worst part, though. It makes it hard to think. And I like to think. I used to fix the trains, you know? Need to think to do that.
DOCTOR: You used to fix trains – that sounds like very meticulous work! And you're right, a headache making it hard to concentrate is very frustrating. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… no. The doctor, long time ago, he checked me. Said everything was okay. Diabetes… no. I eat too many mangos, maybe, but no diabetes. I have been… healthy, I think. For an old man. Just the usual aches and pains. And now this headache. Nothing else. I don’t take any pills, like I said. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of high blood pressure or diabetes, and you haven't taken any regular medications. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And… hmm. One time, when I was young, I fell off the train. But just a little fall. Broke my arm, but they fixed it. That was a long time ago. And that is all. No hospital, except for that arm. I am a strong man, Doctor. I don’t get sick easily. Well… except for this. This headache is… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a young man, but otherwise no significant surgical history or hospitalizations. And you feel this headache is different from anything you’ve experienced before. That's important information. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of headaches, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had headaches sometimes. Very bad headaches. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. Old country ways, you understand? Just rest and drink tea. My father… he was strong. Never sick. No headaches, no nothing. My sister… she had children. I don’t know about her children. We don’t see each other much. I think… that is all. Mostly strong people. No sickness in my family. That is why this is so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had headaches, but didn’t seek medical care, and the rest of your family were generally healthy. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for the lungs. Alcohol… sometimes, a little wine with dinner. Just a small glass. And… no. Nothing else. I am an old man, Doctor. I don’t need… those things. Just the wine, sometimes. Very small glass. And not every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional small glass of wine. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat anything. Mangos, beans, chicken… anything. And… no pollen. I work outside, you know? Around the trains. All sorts of things in the air. I am used to it. No allergies, Doctor. Strong man, remember? But this pain… is not strong. I am strong. This is… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for all of that information, Mitchell. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is okay. Do whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just want this pain to go away. Is like… a little bird pecking at my head. Not a strong bird, but… annoying. And I want to think again. Need to think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. I heard a slight crackling in your lungs, which could be a sign of some congestion, and your reflexes are a little slow. I also noticed some slight involuntary movement in your eyes. These findings, combined with your headache, dizziness and fatigue, are concerning, and we need to investigate further. I want to order a CT scan of your head to rule out any serious underlying cause for your headache, and a chest X-ray to look at those lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A scan? And an X-ray? Hmm… Is… is it dangerous? I don't like machines. And… will it make the pain worse? I just want to fix it, Doctor. I don't want more problems. Is it expensive? I don’t have much money. Will it help me think again? That is all I want.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mitchell. Let's address them one by one. The CT scan and X-ray use a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of finding out what’s causing your symptoms far outweigh the risks. It won't make the pain worse – it’s a quick and painless procedure. As for the cost, I understand your concern. We can discuss options for financial assistance or see if we can find a lower-cost facility. And ultimately, yes, my hope is that these tests will help us identify the cause of your headache and get you back to thinking clearly. The nystagmus, the involuntary eye movement I noticed, is also something that needs to be investigated. It can sometimes be a sign of more serious issues. I know it’s a lot to take in, and I apologize for the additional tests, but it’s important to be thorough. Would you be comfortable with me ordering those tests, and we can discuss the financial aspect afterwards?
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay, Doctor. If you think it is important… then do it. Do the tests. I trust you. But… please, hurry. I want to know what is wrong. And I want to be able to think again. And please… help me with the money. I don’t want to be a burden. Just… help me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mitchell. I will get the orders in right away. The radiology department is in the hospital across town. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, schedule the appointments for you, and she can also help you navigate the financial assistance options. She’s very good at working with patients who are uninsured. I'm also going to prescribe a medication to help manage your headache symptoms in the meantime – it’s a mild pain reliever that shouldn’t interact with any other conditions you might have. We'll get this figured out, Mitchell. I promise. And we'll work together to find a way to make the cost manageable. I’ll have Maria come in and discuss the details with you now. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… no questions right now. Just… hurry, please. I just want to feel better. And think again. Thank you, Doctor. For helping me. That is all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mitchell. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll have Maria come in right away. .
