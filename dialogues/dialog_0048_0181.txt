DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, Doctor Sink, the pleasure is all mine. I requested this wellness panel, you see. Just a general check-up. At my age, one likes to be… thorough. I feel quite well, thankfully, but preventative care is important, wouldn't you agree? My wife, Elena, insisted, actually. She's always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Yes, preventative care. Of course. Though, honestly, at your age, a “general check-up” can be… extensive. We'll need to go through a fair amount of things. Do you have any specific concerns besides just wanting a broad overview?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. Nothing specific troubling me. I sleep well, eat reasonably – Elena makes sure of that – and keep active, mostly gardening. My knees complain a little sometimes after a long day, but that’s to be expected, I suppose. Just wanted to make sure everything is as it should be. No family history of anything dreadful, as far as I know. My parents both lived long lives, though they weren’t particularly… vigilant about doctors, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Gardening, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Roses, mostly. Elena and I have quite the little garden in the back. It keeps me busy, you know? It's very… grounding. I also do a bit of vegetable planting, tomatoes, peppers, the usual. Though Elena does most of the hard work these days, she has a real green thumb. It's good exercise, though, even just puttering around. Keeps me out of trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s get some basics down. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I’m aware of. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard. I eat most everything, though I'm not overly fond of cilantro – but that's a taste preference, not an allergy, certainly. I've had no adverse reactions to any medications in the past, as far as I recall. I had a tetanus shot a few years back, when I scraped my knee pruning the roses, and that was perfectly fine. Elena always reminds me to get those, she’s very diligent about that, too.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. A standard one, nothing fancy. Elena buys it for me, says I need to keep my strength up for the gardening. And occasionally, when my knees are acting up particularly badly, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Just a couple of tablets, as needed. Not regularly, mind you. I prefer to tough it out if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we proceed with the exam, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well, I've been married to Elena for 48 wonderful years now. We have two grown children, a son and a daughter, both happily married with families of their own. They live out of state, in Florida, but we see them a few times a year. I retired about ten years ago, after working construction for… well, a very long time. Mostly building homes, you know? I don’t smoke, never have. And I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner most evenings, but nothing excessive. I wouldn't say I’m a big partier, if that’s what you’re asking. Mostly quiet evenings at home with Elena. Is there something specific you're interested in, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s sufficient. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and reflexes. Then we’ll do a basic neurological assessment. If you could just sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to oblige. Please, let me know if I need to do anything specific. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I might be a little… rusty. Elena always handles these things, usually.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular. Bit of a murmur, not particularly concerning given your age. Lungs clear. Blood pressure is… 148 over 85. A little elevated. Reflexes… normal. Alright. Everything seems… within acceptable limits, for someone your age. We’ll need some blood work to get a better picture.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. The blood pressure is a bit worrying, though. Is that something I should be concerned about immediately? I suppose I do enjoy a good salting of my food; Elena always tells me I overdo it. And the stress of the grandchildren, you know? They keep me on my toes. Perhaps that’s contributing. Is there anything I can do to lower it, besides curtailing my salt intake?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, stress and diet contribute. Lifestyle modifications are important. We’ll get the blood work back, and then we’ll discuss it further. It's likely nothing… dramatic. But it’s good we’re checking. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. And a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to be thorough. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to latex. Elena always checks before any medical procedures, she’s very thorough. I appreciate your attention to detail, though. It’s good to know you’re being… comprehensive. How long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to fast beforehand? I wouldn’t want to ruin Elena’s breakfast, she takes pride in her cooking.
DOCTOR: The results will take approximately three to five business days. Yes, you'll need to fast for twelve hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. Here. This has all the instructions. And the lab is downstairs. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. Do you have any other questions before I finish?
PATIENT: Twelve hours, you say? That might be difficult… Elena always prepares a substantial breakfast. Perhaps I can sneak a small piece of toast beforehand? No, no, you’re right. I’ll manage. Water it is. And no, Doctor, I believe that’s all for now. Thank you for your time and attention. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my… rambling. I’ll head downstairs now.
DOCTOR: Good. Have a good day. The nurse will escort you downstairs. .
