DOCTOR: Alright, Lilliana, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. Thank you. It’s… my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It’s a bit of a bother, you know? Not terrible, but… stiff. I don’t really remember when it started, to be honest. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings. I understand. And you said it's been happening for a while now, but you're not sure exactly how long?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A while. Honestly, doctor, it could be months, could be… longer. It’s hard to say. My husband, he… he would have known. He always kept track of things. But… it’s been some time, definitely. It just…gets worse when it's cold.
DOCTOR: I see. And where exactly are you feeling this stiffness?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly my fingers, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too, but not as bad. It’s when I try to get out of bed in the morning, it's the worst. Everything just…creaks. Like an old house, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do know exactly what you mean. Alright, so fingers, knees, sometimes shoulders, worse in the morning. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints, along with the stiffness?
PATIENT: Swelling… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. They feel a little… bigger sometimes, maybe? But I’m not sure if that’s just… me. Redness… no, I haven't seen any redness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable swelling or redness. And is this stiffness constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's really bad first thing in the morning, like I said. Then it gets a bit better as I move around. By the afternoon, it’s usually not too bad. But if I sit for too long, or if it's really cold, it comes back. It's just...annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so worse in the morning, improves with activity, and returns with prolonged sitting or cold weather. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this, like fatigue, fever, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Fatigue… Oh, yes. I get tired easily, doctor. But I’m 52, you know? And… things have been a bit stressful lately. So I just thought it was that. Fever…no, no fever. And rashes… no, I haven’t noticed any rashes.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, but you attribute that to age and stress. No fever or rash. And just to be thorough, have you had any pain in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Pain… My back sometimes aches a little, but that's just from… gardening, I think. And my hips… they bother me a little when I walk too far. But I just figured that was part of getting older too. Nothing major, you understand. It's just little things, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, some back and hip discomfort, likely related to activity. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like arthritis, lupus, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I don’t think so, doctor. My husband always handled the doctor’s appointments and things. I just…went along. He said I was healthy enough, mostly. I haven't really been sick with anything serious, not that I recall. I might have had a touch of the flu once, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. That’s the only surgery I can remember. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my arm, a long time ago. But other than that… no, I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, or grandparents – who have been diagnosed with arthritis, autoimmune diseases, or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother… she had something with her hands, I think. She complained about them hurting a lot when she got older. But I don't really remember what it was. And my grandmother… she had a bit of trouble walking when she was very old, but I don't think it was anything specific. Honestly, doctor, I wasn't very close to them, and I wasn’t much interested in their health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of hand pain in your mother and walking difficulties in your grandmother. Now, could you tell me about your current medications?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t take anything regularly, doctor. Not anymore. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill, but the doctor said I didn’t need it anymore. I just have some creams for my skin, but that’s all. No pain relievers, no nothing. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any trouble with any medicines. I remember being stung by a bee when I was a child, but that was just a bit of swelling. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'm going to check your joints for tenderness, swelling, and range of motion. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, doctor. Go ahead. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable. I do worry about my joints, you know? They just feel…old.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to ask you to bend your fingers for me, all the way in, and then straighten them out. Okay, and now your knees. Alright. Your finger joints have some crepitus with movement, a little bit of grinding sensation. Your knees also have crepitus, and I notice a slight limitation in full extension – they don't straighten out completely. There's mild tenderness when I press here, on the inside of your knees. And your shoulders have good range of motion, but I do notice a little bit of discomfort when you lift your arms above your head. Overall, the exam shows some mild joint inflammation and limited range of motion, particularly in your knees and fingers. We'll need to discuss some potential causes and what we can do about it.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… not surprising, I suppose. I knew something wasn’t right. Crepitus, you say? Is that…bad? I just want to be able to garden again without feeling like an old woman!
DOCTOR: Crepitus is common as we age, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but in your case, combined with the tenderness and limited range of motion, it suggests some underlying joint wear and tear. It's likely osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. Essentially, the cartilage in your joints is wearing down, causing friction and inflammation. We need to confirm this with some imaging, though – I'd like to order an X-ray of your knees and hands. That will give us a clearer picture of the cartilage and bone structure. In the meantime, we can start with some conservative management. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis… That sounds…serious. Is that why my joints feel stiff in the morning? And…will it get worse? X-rays… I suppose that's alright. I just… I don't want to end up needing a new hip or something.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis can progress, but it doesn’t automatically mean you’ll need a joint replacement. It varies from person to person. The stiffness in the morning is very common with osteoarthritis; it’s caused by fluid buildup in the joints overnight. When you start moving around, the fluid helps lubricate the joint, which is why it improves with activity. We can often manage osteoarthritis effectively with conservative treatments, like physical therapy, weight management if needed, and pain relief medications. We'll start with the X-rays to get a baseline and then discuss a tailored plan to help you manage your symptoms and stay active. Before we proceed, do you have any insurance coverage to help with the cost of the X-rays and potential future treatments?
PATIENT: Oh… No, doctor, I don’t. My husband… he always took care of those things. After he passed, I just… I didn’t bother with it, to be honest. I don’t have much money, either. I live on a small pension. I don’t know what I’ll do if it’s expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. That’s certainly a concern. We can discuss options for low-cost imaging and explore resources available to help with medical expenses. Many facilities offer financial assistance programs, and we can also see if there are any local charities or organizations that can provide support. For now, let’s focus on the X-rays. I'll write a referral for you to get them done at the imaging center across the street – they're generally the most affordable. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan that fits your budget and needs. In the meantime, try to stay as active as you can, within your comfort level, and avoid activities that worsen your pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage your discomfort. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… Ibuprofen… yes, I think I have some of that. My husband used to take it for his back. So, just stay active, but not too active… and take the ibuprofen. And then we’ll see what the pictures say? That sounds… manageable, I suppose. Thank you, doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Stay active, within your comfort level, and the ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammation. And yes, once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, doctor. Just… thank you again. You’ve put my mind a little more at ease. I was very worried, you know. I'll go get those pictures done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
