DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 62 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, sixty-two. It’s… the chest. It hurts sometimes. Not all the time, you know? Just… feels tight. Like someone is sitting on it, maybe? It started… oh, maybe a week ago? I don’t know exactly.
DOCTOR: “Tightness,” you say. A week ago. And can you describe where exactly you feel this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… mostly in the middle. Right here. Not… going all the way around, you know? More… in the front. And sometimes it feels… like it goes to my left arm a little bit. Not a lot, just… a little. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: And when does this occur, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It… it doesn't seem to be when I'm doing something. Not like walking, or cleaning. It's more… when I'm resting, maybe? Or… when I’m worried about something. My grandson, he… he’s starting a new job, very far away. Maybe that’s it? I don’t know. It just… happens. It doesn't last long, though. Just a few minutes.
DOCTOR: So, it's associated with rest and periods of emotional stress, and resolves within a few minutes. Do you experience any other symptoms with this tightness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little… out of breath. Not very out of breath, just… like I can’t take a deep breath. And… maybe a little sweaty sometimes. Just my hands, though. Not all over. And… no, that’s all I think. It doesn't go to my jaw, or neck, or anything like that. I've been reading things online… and I get scared, you know? That's why I came.
DOCTOR: Online reading is often… unreliable, Ms. Chelberg. It’s best to leave the diagnosis to professionals. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Not really. Just… old age aches, you know? My knees bother me sometimes, but that's it. And… I had a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. No fever, no cough, nothing like that. Just the chest. It's just… worrying. It feels different than… heartburn, you know? I get heartburn sometimes, but this isn’t like that.
DOCTOR: And what is your past medical history, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. But I take the pills he gave me, every day. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? Other than that… not much. I try to eat healthy, you know? And I walk when I can, but my knees… They don't always cooperate.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I have them in my purse. Here. Lisinopril, that’s for the blood pressure. One a day. And… Ibuprofen, sometimes, for my knees. When they really bother me. And… that's it, I think. Oh! And a vitamin D. The doctor said I was low. Is that enough? I try to remember, but sometimes… my memory, you know? It’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Shellfish, peanuts, everything. Never had a problem. And… no reactions to any of the pills the doctor gave me. I’ve been taking the Lisinopril for… oh, maybe five years now? Never had a rash, or trouble breathing, or anything like that. I am very careful, you know? I don’t want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, too. And she had a… a problem with her heart, later in life. But I don't know exactly what. She didn’t really talk about it much. And my father… he was healthy, mostly. He smoked a lot, though. And… my brother, he had a stroke a few years ago. But… that's all I can really remember. It’s been a long time. We don’t really talk about these things much, you know? It makes people sad.
DOCTOR: I see. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history? Well, I'm married. My husband, Ricardo, he's… he's good. We've been married for forty years! And… I have three grown children, and six grandchildren. They are my life. I used to work, as a transportation inspector, but I retired a few years ago. Now I mostly stay home, cook, and spend time with my family. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. Never have. I like to garden when the weather is nice, but my knees… They don't always cooperate. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Chelberg, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. Please remove your blouse, and I will provide a gown.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds good, Doctor. Should I… should I take off my bra too? I always forget these things. And… is it cold in here? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, please remove your bra as well, Ms. Chelberg. It will allow for a more thorough examination. And no, the room is at a standard temperature. I will ensure you are comfortable. Please, if you could lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Here. Is this okay? It’s a little hard to get comfortable. And… could I have a blanket? I am getting cold.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Chelberg. And another. Heart sounds… regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No tenderness to palpation. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning, given her history. Your examination is unremarkable, Ms. Chelberg. I believe your symptoms are likely due to stress and musculoskeletal discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. That's… good, I guess? But… the chest pain? It feels real, you know? It scares me. Is it possible… something is wrong with my heart? Maybe I need a test? Just to be sure? And… what about the sweating? And the out of breath feeling? Is that from the stress too?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I understand your concerns. However, you present with no acute signs or symptoms of a cardiac event. Sweating and shortness of breath can often accompany anxiety, and musculoskeletal pain can easily be mistaken for cardiac discomfort. I recommend managing your stress through relaxation techniques and avoiding strenuous activity. I can prescribe a mild anxiolytic if you feel it is necessary. However, I do not believe further testing is warranted at this time. We do not want to subject you to unnecessary procedures. Follow up with me in one month, and we can reassess if your symptoms persist.
PATIENT: Oh. Just… stress? But what if… what if it is my heart? I don't want to ignore something serious, you know? My mother… she didn’t get help until it was too late. Could I… could I get a second opinion? Just to be sure? Or maybe… just one small test? An EKG, or something? Just to put my mind at ease?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, I have thoroughly examined you, and I assure you, your concerns are unfounded. However, I understand your anxiety. Very well. I will write a referral to a cardiologist for a consultation, simply to appease your concerns. However, I strongly advise you to manage your expectations. I anticipate the cardiologist will concur with my assessment. This is not to say there is anything wrong, Ms. Chelberg. It is simply a matter of reassurance. Schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. And please, try to relax. Worrying will only exacerbate your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me. And… thank you for the prescription. I will try to relax. And I will schedule the appointment. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Chelberg. .
