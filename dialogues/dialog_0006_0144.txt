DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Calvery, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Gorga, is it? Yes, well, honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My daughter suggested I come. She worries too much, that one. Says I should “get checked out.” I feel fine, perfectly fine, for my age. Just… curious, I suppose. It’s not like anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Right, “getting checked out.” That’s perfectly reasonable. Sometimes things don’t have to hurt to be worth looking into. Hmm… Let’s just start with a general history, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a baseline. Now, 64… and your daughter mentioned you’re feeling generally okay?
PATIENT: Generally okay, yes. Though I do get… a little winded climbing the stairs. But who doesn't? I’ve lived a long life, you know. And I was a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades. Lots of lifting, rushing around. It takes its toll. Though I was always a good one. Very precise. Not like some of those youngsters these days. Always messing things up.
DOCTOR: Surgical tech for decades… that’s a physically demanding job. And precision is important, yes. Okay, so a little shortness of breath with stairs... is that new, or has that been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. It comes and goes, really. Hard to say when it started. Probably… since my husband passed. Everything feels harder since then, you know? Not just the stairs. Everything. It’s probably just… old age creeping in. Don’t fuss over it too much, dear. I’m not made of porcelain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can definitely affect how you feel physically. And it's good you're here, even if it's just for a check-up. It's helpful to rule things out, just to be sure. Let's talk about some other things, if you're comfortable. Any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, heavens. What kind of symptoms? I… I think my ankles swell sometimes. But that's probably the salt. I like a good potato chip, you know? And I get tired easily. But honestly, who doesn't get tired? I'm not a spring chicken anymore. Is that what you want to know? All the things old people complain about? Because I could go on.
DOCTOR: No, not complaints, just information. Ankles swelling… does that happen at the end of the day, or is it pretty constant?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly at the end of the day, I think. After I’ve been on my feet a bit. I like to potter around in the garden, you see. Though it's not what it used to be. My daughter keeps telling me to slow down. She worries about me falling. Honestly, she treats me like a fragile teacup. But yes, the ankles. A bit puffy, that's all. It goes down if I put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any chest pain, or palpitations – that's a fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no. Not a bit. Pal…palpi… what did you say? Flut… fluttering? No, nothing like that. My heart feels fine, as far as I know. I’ve always had a strong heart. It’s had to be, after all those years on my feet. Though I do get… a little breathless sometimes, like we were saying. Is that what you mean? Because that’s not pain, dear. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathlessness, we've covered. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness. I don't think so. I used to take something for my sinuses, years ago. But I can't remember what it was called. And I don’t really take anything now, except… oh! That little pink pill my daughter gives me. For… well, I don't know what it’s for. She says it’s good for my bones. But it doesn’t seem to do much. Honestly, she gives me so many pills, I can’t keep track. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, though. Not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Little pink pill”… we’ll try to figure that out later. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and things like that. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, fine, fine. Go ahead. But don’t fuss too much. I'm not broken, you know. And please, don’t make me take off my shoes. These are very comfortable. I've had them for years. And I'm particular about my feet.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Shoes stay on. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Alright, lungs sound clear, though a little diminished on the bases. Heart rate is regular, but a bit on the faster side. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A little elevated. And I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Let’s just check your reflexes quickly.
PATIENT: Oh, elevated, is it? My daughter warned me about that. Always going on about salt. Honestly, she treats me like I’m a child. I've lived a long life, you know? I know how to take care of myself. Diminished, you say? Well, I am 64, dear. Everything diminishes eventually. Reflexes… Get it over with then. Don’t poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are a little sluggish, but nothing concerning. Okay, Mrs. Calvery, based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, your blood pressure is a bit high, and your lungs sound a little quiet. Your ankles are swollen, and that little pink pill is something we should identify. I'd like to order a few basic blood tests and an EKG – that's a quick heart tracing – just to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests already? See? I told you she worries too much. A heart tracing… sounds rather serious, doesn't it? But… alright, fine. Go ahead with your tests. But please don’t tell my daughter everything. She’ll have me wrapped in bubble wrap if you do. And honestly, I’m not that sick. Just a bit old and tired, that’s all. And get to the bottom of that pink pill, please. It does nothing, I tell you. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll make a note to keep your daughter informed at a high level. We’re just being thorough, Mrs. Calvery. The blood tests and EKG will give us more information. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood and schedule the EKG for you. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake, staying hydrated, and try to get some moderate exercise when you can. And we'll definitely figure out what that pink pill is. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Limiting salt... and water. And exercise... Honestly, it all sounds rather exhausting. But... fine. A plan. As long as I don't have to spend the rest of my days living in a hospital. Just get it over with then. And tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle, will you? I bruise easily, you know. .
