DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Finco. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter with my place of employment, and the requirements for masks… or, personal protective equipment. I believe you understand. It’s a bit… complicated, and I want to be sure I do this correctly.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand. Workplace safety regulations can be quite complex. It's good you're being proactive about it. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about your job?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I work as a Protective Service Worker. Mostly, I assist individuals who require help with… well, a variety of things. It can range from making sure they have access to food and shelter, to helping them navigate paperwork, to just being someone to talk to. It’s a job that requires a lot of close contact with people, and often in their homes. That's where the mask situation becomes… difficult. I don’t want to cause any trouble, but it’s been a strain.
DOCTOR: That sounds like very important work, Mr. Knabenshue, and I can see why close contact would be a concern, especially given everything that's been going on. It's good you're thinking about protecting yourself and those you assist. To get a clearer picture, are there specific requirements from your employer regarding PPE, or is this more about ensuring you have adequate protection while following guidelines?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It’s both, actually. My employer requires us to wear masks at all times when interacting with clients, and they’ve provided us with the standard disposable masks. But… I’ve found them to be quite uncomfortable, and they make it difficult to breathe, especially when I’m moving around or trying to communicate clearly. It also… impacts my ability to properly assess a situation, if I'm constantly adjusting the mask or feeling short of breath. I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps alternative solutions.
DOCTOR: I understand. Comfort and clear communication are essential, especially in your line of work. We certainly don't want anything to compromise your safety or your ability to provide effective care. Before we discuss exemptions, let's just quickly go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I haven’t had a cold or the flu in… well, I can’t recall the last time, truthfully. I try to stay very healthy. I do have some… sensitivities. I’ve always been prone to skin irritation, and certain fabrics can bother me quite a bit. That might be relevant to the mask situation, I suppose. And I have a mild sensitivity to strong smells. Other than that, I’m quite healthy for my age, if I may say so myself. I try to stay active and eat well.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. The skin sensitivities are certainly relevant, and the smell sensitivity is good information to have as well. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve always been able to eat pretty much anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication I’ve been given. It’s one of the few blessings I’ve been given, I suppose. I’ve always been careful about what I put on my skin, though, given the sensitivities we discussed. I mostly use natural products, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies is certainly good. And being mindful of skincare is helpful information, too. Now, regarding your work—and this is just to be thorough—have you had a COVID-19 test recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. My employer requires regular testing, as you might expect. The last test was just a week ago, on July 26th, and it came back negative. I can provide documentation if you need it. It’s a simple nasal swab, nothing too unpleasant. I understand the importance of keeping everyone safe, and I’m happy to comply with the testing requirements. I just… I’m hoping we can find a solution that allows me to continue my work comfortably and effectively.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. A recent negative test is certainly helpful. It sounds like you’re being very diligent about safety, which is excellent. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin, particularly around where the mask rubs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I’m happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I'm ready when you are. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. It means a great deal to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up straight on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezing, crackles, or rhonchi auscultated. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Skin appears slightly dry around the bridge of the nose and cheeks, with some minor redness. No active rash or signs of significant irritation noted. Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Everything appears generally healthy. The dryness and redness are consistent with mask use. Now, are you experiencing any shortness of breath outside of wearing the mask?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I do not experience any shortness of breath outside of wearing the mask. I walk regularly, and I don't have any difficulty with exertion. I haven’t had any chest pain or dizziness either. The discomfort is solely related to the mask itself, and the feeling of restriction it causes. It’s… more of an annoyance, and a slight difficulty in breathing while wearing it, rather than a genuine medical concern. It’s hard to explain, truly. It's a feeling of being… constricted, and it makes it harder to focus on my work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re describing a feeling of discomfort and mild dyspnea specifically related to mask use, rather than an underlying respiratory issue. That's helpful to know. Given your medical history, the negative COVID test, and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a sensitivity or mild claustrophobia related to the masks. However, before we jump to any conclusions, I'd like to explore some alternative options. Have you tried different types of masks?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My employer provides us with the standard three-ply disposable masks, but I’ve also purchased a few cloth masks on my own, hoping they would be more comfortable. Unfortunately, the cloth masks don’t offer the same level of protection, and my employer requires us to wear the disposable ones. I’ve also tried adjusting the nose wire to create more space, but that doesn’t seem to help much. It just… doesn't alleviate the feeling of restriction. I’ve tried different sizes as well, but none seem to fit comfortably without causing discomfort. It’s a frustrating situation, truthfully. I want to be safe, but I also need to be able to do my job effectively.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you've already tried a few things. Since the disposable masks are a requirement, and alternatives haven't been successful, let's discuss the possibility of a note for your employer outlining your sensitivities and recommending a possible accommodation. Would you be open to me writing a note suggesting a trial period with a slightly looser-fitting disposable mask, if available, to see if that alleviates the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. A note from you outlining my sensitivities and recommending a trial period with a looser-fitting mask would be extremely helpful. I would be very grateful for that. I'm willing to try anything that might improve the situation, and having your professional opinion behind it would carry a lot of weight with my employer. Thank you for considering this. It means a great deal to me. Perhaps, if a looser fit isn’t possible, we could discuss the possibility of a face shield as an alternative?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m happy to do that. I’ll write a note detailing your sensitivities to mask materials, your negative COVID test, and recommend a trial period with a slightly looser-fitting disposable mask, if available. We can also include a statement about exploring a face shield as a possible alternative if a looser-fitting mask is not feasible. I'll print this out for you now, and we can discuss follow-up plans should the accommodation not be sufficient. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds perfect. A note outlining those points is exactly what I was hoping for. I do not have any further questions at this time. Thank you for your time, your understanding, and your willingness to help me with this. I truly appreciate it. I feel much better knowing that we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if the accommodation doesn't alleviate your discomfort, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the office. We can re-evaluate and explore other options. Here’s the note. Please, take care, and I wish you all the best with your work. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Finco. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and your assistance. I will contact you if anything changes. .
