DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, I’m here about getting surgery, I think. For my weight. It’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, honestly. I don’t really remember all the details of how we got here, but my wife helped set everything up. She said it was an evaluation for… bariatric surgery? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Mr. Kochubey. It is perfectly alright if details are unclear – we can certainly clarify everything during our discussion. Yes, your wife scheduled an evaluation for bariatric surgery. It sounds as though you're considering surgical options for weight management. To begin, could you tell me a bit about your weight journey?
PATIENT: Weight journey… That’s a big question. I… I’ve always been a little bigger, I guess. Growing up, it wasn’t a huge deal. But things definitely changed over the years. After… after my time in Iraq, it got harder to keep it off. And then life, you know? Work, family… It just kind of crept up on me. I don't really know when it became a problem, exactly. Does that make sense? I'm not good with dates or timelines.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. Many factors can contribute to weight gain, and it’s not uncommon for it to be a gradual process. It's admirable that you're addressing it now. You mentioned your time in Iraq. Was there a specific event or change during that period that you feel may have contributed to changes in your weight or overall health?
PATIENT: It’s… complicated. There was a lot of stress, obviously. And the food wasn't great. Mostly processed stuff, you know? Not a lot of fresh things. And honestly… things were just different. I wasn’t taking care of myself like I should have. It’s hard to explain without… well, without getting into everything. It was a long time ago. I mostly just… shut things down, if that makes sense. I ate a lot, didn’t exercise… just tried to cope. I don’t really like talking about it. Is it okay if I skip that part?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. You are not obligated to share anything you’re not comfortable discussing. We can absolutely move forward without delving into the details of your time in Iraq. Let's focus on the present then. Could you describe your current diet?
PATIENT: Right, okay, the present is good. Um… my diet… It’s not great. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, she’s a really good cook, but… I work a lot of hours at the store, and it’s easy to grab something quick. Fast food, mostly. Burgers, fries… sometimes pizza. I drink a lot of soda, too. I know it’s bad for me. And honestly, I snack a lot when I'm stressed. Chips, cookies… just whatever's around. I don’t really pay attention to what I'm eating, if that makes sense. I just eat until I'm full.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest, Mr. Kochubey. It's helpful to have a clear picture of your current eating habits. And it's common to fall into patterns of convenience and emotional eating. Now, regarding your activity level: on a typical week, how much physical activity do you get?
PATIENT: Not enough. I work on my feet all day at the store, so I’m moving around some, but it’s not really exercise, you know? It’s just… walking back and forth. I used to play soccer when I was younger, but I haven’t done that in years. I get tired easily now, so I mostly just relax on the couch when I get home from work. My wife keeps trying to get me to go for walks with her, but… I usually just say no. I feel bad about it, but I'm just always so tired. Does that make sense? I’m not a very active person, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like your work involves physical exertion, but it isn't structured exercise. It's common for fatigue to accompany weight gain. Now, let's talk a bit about your health history. Do you have any medical conditions currently being treated, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff. I think… I think the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high last time, but I'm not really sure. And my cholesterol… yeah, she mentioned that too. Something about it being too high. I don’t really remember the specifics. I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes, as far as I know. Honestly, I just try not to think about it too much. I’m not good with medical stuff. I can ask my wife when I get home if that helps? She's really good at remembering all that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's very helpful that you're aware your wife has mentioned elevated blood pressure and cholesterol. And it’s a good idea to confirm the details with her. For the sake of a complete assessment, let me ask about past surgeries or hospitalizations. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… um… I think I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And… there was something when I was in Iraq, but I don't remember exactly what it was. It wasn’t a big surgery, I don’t think. Just… something they had to fix. I was pretty out of it, so I don’t have many details. Honestly, my memory is really bad about stuff like that. I can ask my wife, but I doubt she knows either. She wasn't with me then. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It’s alright if details are unclear, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing you sustained an injury as a child and received medical attention during your time in Iraq is helpful. It is good that you were seen for both. We can move forward without further detail for now. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or obesity?
PATIENT: My mom… she had diabetes. She struggled with it for a long time. And my dad… he had heart problems. He… he passed away a few years ago. And I think… I think my older brother is also diabetic. It seems like it runs in the family, yeah. And… I guess you could say obesity too. A lot of us are bigger, you know? It's just… always been that way. I don’t know if that helps. It's not something we really talked about much. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about your family history of diabetes, heart disease, and a predisposition to obesity is important information. It can help us understand your risk factors. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, really. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I don’t have any problems with pollen or dust, or anything like that. My wife says I should be careful with shellfish, but I haven’t eaten it in years, so I don’t know if that counts. I’m pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything, but I could be wrong. Does it matter? I haven’t really ever thought about it much.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't necessarily matter if you haven't experienced any allergic reactions, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good that you haven't had any known reactions. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to take something for my back, but that was a long time ago. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills, so I try to avoid them as much as possible. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them. Honestly, I don't take any regular medication. Does that help? Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m forgetting something… but I can’t put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good to know you’re not currently taking any regular medications. Okay, I’m reviewing the notes from your initial consultation and the information your wife provided. Your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters. Your BMI is 36.7, which falls into the category of obesity. I see she noted concerns about your blood pressure and cholesterol, and a family history of diabetes and heart disease. Based on your history and preliminary information, it does sound as though bariatric surgery may be a viable option. However, before we proceed, I’d like to conduct a physical exam and order some blood work to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. If you think it’s a good idea, I trust you. A physical exam and blood work… whatever you need to do. I just… I just want to feel better, you know? If surgery can help with that, then I’m willing to try. Just let me know what I need to do. And… if it's okay to ask… what kind of surgery are we talking about? I don’t know anything about it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Kochubey. I understand your desire to feel better, and we'll work together to determine the best course of action. Let’s start with a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and I can hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is above the recommended range. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness upon palpation. I am noting some increased abdominal fat. Now, regarding the type of surgery, there are several options. The two most common are gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Gastric bypass involves creating a smaller stomach pouch and rerouting the small intestine to bypass part of the stomach. Sleeve gastrectomy involves removing a portion of the stomach, creating a smaller, tube-shaped stomach. Both procedures can lead to significant weight loss, but they have different risks and benefits. We can discuss these in detail once we have the results of your blood work.
