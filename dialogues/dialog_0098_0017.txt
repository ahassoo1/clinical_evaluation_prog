DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, I… uh… they said I gotta have this done. For the… the team. A physical, that’s right. A physical. Don't really remember much about why exactly, just that it was needed. Something about playing, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physical… for the team. Right. That’s perfectly alright. It’s quite common to have these done as part of a sports requirement, or for work. We’ll just go through a standard examination, and I’ll document everything. Let me start by accessing your records… Ah, yes. Danny Bartok, age 51. It says here you're 5'3" and 124 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Five foot three? Hmm… I suppose. Maybe a little taller. I ain’t measured myself in… well, a long time. And the weight, that sounds right enough. I watch what I eat, mostly. Not like these young fellas nowadays, stuffing their faces with… everything. Honestly. But five foot three… sounds a bit short, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, these numbers are just estimates. We can always re-measure if you’d prefer. It doesn’t drastically change things, but we want to be as accurate as possible. Now, before we do any measurements, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any current medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: High… what now? Look, Doctor, I don’t go to doctors much. Never really needed to. I get a little tired sometimes, like anyone, but… problems? Not that I know of. I used to be real strong, could lift anything. Still can, mostly. My ex-wife used to complain about it. Always moving furniture around. She… she was a difficult woman. But no, no problems. As far as I know. What is high… blood pressure? Sounds bad.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright. Many people aren’t familiar with medical terms. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is when the force of your blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. It’s very common, and often doesn’t have any symptoms, which is why it's good to check it regularly. We'll check yours in a moment. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… Hmm. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree. Had a cast and everything. Does that count? And I used to get… what they call it… heartburn. Bad indigestion. But that was years ago. Just ate something bad, probably. No… I don't think anyone ever told me I had anything serious. Just the usual aches and pains, like getting old. You know? Don’t tell me I’m old, though. I still got some life left in me.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t seem old at all, Mr. Bartok! And a broken arm and heartburn don't count as diagnoses we need to worry about right now. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see. Now… my ex-wife wanted me to get my wisdom teeth out. Said they were ruining her appetite just looking at ‘em. But I refused. Said it was too risky. So, no. Never had any surgeries. Not interested. Too much poking and prodding. And she… she’d have had a field day afterwards, telling everyone all about it. No, never. Definitely no surgeries.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Bartok. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, I take a little something for my stomach sometimes. When it really bothers me. It's… uh… a little white pill. Don’t remember the name. Bought it at the corner store. And sometimes, when my knees ache, I take some of that stuff… you know… the pain reliever. Like ibuprofen, I think? Over-the-counter. Nothing special. Just for when I need it. That's about it. Really. Don’t like taking pills unless I have to. Messes with your head.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees, and something for your stomach. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had no allergies. I grew up outside, running around. Dust, dirt, everything. Built up an immunity, I guess. Sometimes my eyes itch when the flowers bloom, but that's just the pollen. Everyone gets that. No, no allergies. Definitely not. I can eat anything. And I like animals, mostly. Though that neighbor’s dog barks too much. But that ain't an allergy, that's just annoying. No, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a tough one. Didn’t really talk about that much with my family. My mother… she was a worrier. Always getting sick, or saying she was sick. I think she had… something with her heart. But I don’t remember exactly. And my father… he worked hard. Never took a day off. Probably had everything. Back pain, definitely. And my sister… she moved away a long time ago. Haven’t seen her in years. Don’t know nothin’ about her health. So… not really. Didn’t pay much attention to all that. They all… you know… got old. That’s all I remember. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a blur.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bartok. It’s common for family medical history to be unclear. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, you know. My mother always said so. And it smells terrible. Gives me a headache just thinking about it. No, never smoked. And I don't like being around people who do. Makes me cough. Always have been a healthy man, mostly. Clean living. Except for maybe the occasional… well, never mind. But definitely not a smoker.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I have a beer sometimes. With the boys. A couple, after work. Nothing fancy. Just to relax. And maybe a glass of wine with dinner, on a special occasion. But I don’t drink every day. Not a big drinker. Never have been. Don’t need it. Just… social. That’s all. Mostly. Don't go wild or anything. Just a little something to unwind.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, tell me a little about your work or daily activities. What do you do with your time?
PATIENT: Well, I do a bit of everything. Construction, mostly. Helping out where I can. Fixing things, building things. I’m a handy man, you see? Always been good with my hands. I used to be a carpenter, but… things change. Now I just take on odd jobs. Whatever needs doing, really. Keeps me busy, you know? And I like being outside. Gets me moving. Used to play softball with the team, too. That's why I'm here, right? Getting checked out. Used to be real good. Still am, I think. But the knees… they ain't what they used to be. That's why they want me to get this done. Make sure I ain't gonna fall apart on the field. Though I doubt I will. I'm a tough man, you know? Tough as nails.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're very active. That’s excellent. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or why you're here today?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, sometimes I get a little dizzy. Not often, but… every now and then. Especially when I stand up too fast. But it goes away quickly. And my knees… they click a lot. Makes a funny noise. Doesn’t hurt, just… annoying. And I sometimes forget things. Like… what I was just saying. Oh, and I worry about falling. Especially when I’m climbing ladders. Used to be fearless, you know? But things change. But mostly, I just want to make sure I'm still good to play. Still got some life left in me. And I don't want some old knees to hold me back. That’s all. I think that's everything. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. I just want to be able to play. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, that’s not too much to ask at all. And you’re doing the right thing by getting checked out. It's good you mentioned the dizziness, knee clicking, and forgetfulness. Those are all things we should take a look at. Alright. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and look at those knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Just don’t poke and prod too much. And be gentle with the knees. They’re sensitive. Honestly, Doctor, I ain't afraid of a little poking, but I like to know what you're doing. Don't want no surprises. And if I start to feel dizzy, let me know. Don't want to fall over in here. Just… be careful. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Let’s start by taking your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright. Just… don't squeeze too tight. My veins aren’t what they used to be. And tell me if it's gonna hurt. I hate surprises. Honestly, Doctor, it's just a little thing, but I get nervous sometimes. Old habits, I guess. Just be careful, that’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I will be very careful, Mr. Bartok. I’m just inflating the cuff now. It will feel a little pressure on your arm for a moment. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… tell me if you hear anything weird. Like… skipping or something. My mother always said a skipping heart was bad. And try not to hold the stethoscope too cold, it gives me a chill. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just a little thing, but I don’t like being cold. Now… what did you hear? Is everything alright? Don’t beat around the bush, just tell me straight. I can handle it. I think.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds normal so far, Mr. Bartok. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Ugh… there we go. That's the tricky part. Feels a little stiff, you know? Used to be real flexible. Now… it’s just a little creaky. Honestly, Doctor, don't push too hard. I don’t want to pull anything. And tell me if you see anything weird. Like… swelling or something. And try not to poke too much, it’s sensitive. Honestly, it’s just old age, I guess. But tell me what you see. I want to know. Don’t sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. I think.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild crepitus with flexion and extension – that’s the clicking you mentioned. No significant tenderness to palpation, and no noticeable swelling. Range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely so. It appears to be some mild osteoarthritis, which is common with age and activity. Nothing too alarming, Mr. Bartok. It’s something we can manage.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Arthritis? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds bad. Is that gonna stop me from playing? Is that gonna make me fall apart? Just tell me straight. Don't beat around the bush. And what does "manage" mean? Do I need… pills? Shots? Just tell me what I need to do. I want to play, you know? That's all I care about. Is it gonna be okay? Honestly, it’s just my knees. But they’re important. Really important. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, let's talk about this. Osteoarthritis simply means there's some wear and tear on the cartilage in your knees. It’s very common, and doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop playing. It can cause some pain and stiffness, but it’s something we can manage with a few different strategies. We can start with some simple things, like over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen, like you've been taking – when you have pain. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your range of motion. And we can talk about some exercises you can do at home. As for shots, we don't necessarily need to start with those. We can see how you respond to the other treatments first. And pills… we can consider them if the pain is severe and isn't responding to other measures. The goal is to keep you active and playing for as long as possible. It’s about managing your symptoms and protecting your knees. We’ll work together to find a plan that works for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so no pills right away? Just… exercises and ibuprofen? And no falling apart? Honestly, Doctor, that’s a relief. But what about the team? They’re gonna want to know if I’m still good to play. And I don’t want to let them down. Can you… write something? Like a note, saying I’m okay? And what kind of exercises? I don’t wanna spend all day doing some fancy stuff. Just something simple. And what if it gets worse? What if I can’t walk? Honestly, Doctor, I’m just worried. I wanna play. That's all. Is it gonna be okay? Really okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns. We can absolutely write a note for your team, explaining your condition and stating that you're able to play with some modifications. It’ll explain that you have mild osteoarthritis, and that we’re working on a plan to manage it. As for exercises, we’ll start simple. Things like gentle stretching, quad strengthening – that’s the muscles in the front of your thigh – and hamstring strengthening – the muscles in the back of your thigh. I can give you a handout with some specific exercises, and recommend a physical therapist who can create a more personalized plan. And if it gets worse, we’ll address it. We can consider stronger medications, injections, or even other treatments. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust your plan as needed. We’ll do everything we can to keep you playing, Mr. Bartok. It’s about listening to your body, managing your symptoms, and working together. We’ll start with these simple measures and see how you respond. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s a little hard to read. My eyesight ain’t what it used to be. But… okay. So exercises and pills if I need ‘em. And a physical… what was it… therapist? Is that gonna be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And what if they tell me I can’t play? I don’t wanna waste my money on something that’s just gonna tell me I’m too old. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just worried about the cost. And about letting the team down. Can you… recommend someone who’s… affordable? And who understands? Someone who won’t just tell me I’m too old to play softball? That's all I ask. Just someone who understands.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns about the cost and finding the right therapist. Let me give you a list of a few physical therapists in the area who offer reasonable rates and have a good reputation. I’ve spoken to them before, and they’re very understanding and patient. They specialize in sports injuries and are accustomed to working with athletes of all ages. I’ve also included some information about financial assistance programs that may be available. And, honestly, most therapists will work with you to create a plan that fits your budget. As for them telling you you’re too old to play, I highly doubt that will happen. These therapists are focused on helping you maintain your activity level and manage your symptoms. They’ll work with you to develop a plan that allows you to continue playing softball safely and comfortably. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. These names… I think I recognize a couple. Maybe. Alright. I’ll give ‘em a call. See what they say. And the financial assistance… that’s good. Really good. Honestly, Doctor, you’ve been a big help. I was worried sick. But you’ve calmed me down. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. And… can I get a copy of that note? For myself? Just to… remember what you said? And… one last thing. What should I do if my knee gets really bad? Like… if I can’t walk on it? Just… what do I do? Honestly, Doctor, I worry. That's just me. But thank you. Really. You’ve been a big help.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. Here you are. And you’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help calm your worries. If your knee gets really bad – if you experience severe pain, can’t walk on it, or if it feels unstable – you should see a doctor immediately. You may have a tear or other injury that needs attention. In that case, go to the nearest urgent care center or emergency room, or call your primary care physician. But let’s focus on getting you started with these exercises and managing your symptoms. I have a good feeling that we can keep you playing softball for a long time to come. I'll make a note to follow up with you in a couple of weeks to see how you’re doing. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Mr. Bartok. And good luck with your softball season!
