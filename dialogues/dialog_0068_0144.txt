DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Sham, is it? Yes, well, honestly... I'm not entirely sure. My daughter, bless her heart, she just thought I should get "checked out." She worries too much, that one. I feel fine, mostly. Just...old, I suppose. It's good to be proactive, she says. Though, what is there to be proactive about? I haven't been sick a day in my life, practically.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Sometimes a general check-up is a good idea, even if you feel well. It's good your daughter encourages that. "Old," as you say… can you tell me a little more about what “old” feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, don't get me started. It’s just…things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, you know? My memory, for one. It’s like trying to hold water in your hands. Gone before you realize it. And my knees... don't even mention the stairs. Though, that might just be from all those years on my feet in the operating room. It's a long time to stand, let me tell you. I was a surgical tech, you know. A good one, too. Though, when exactly I retired… honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. Memory issues and knee pain… we can certainly look into both of those. You mentioned being a surgical technician… that is physically demanding work. Do you recall roughly when you retired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me things! Let me see… it was… after my husband passed. Definitely after. He was a good man, Arthur. Worked at the post office. No, wait… that was my brother! Oh, dear. It was… a long time ago. Probably… the early 2000s? Maybe? It was before my daughter had her second child, definitely. She's… what is she now? Forty-two? Forty-three? See? It’s all jumbled up. It's terribly frustrating. I used to have such a good head for dates.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Calvery. These things happen. It’s not uncommon to have some memory lapses as we get older. Don’t worry about the exact dates. We'll figure things out. Let's try a different approach. Besides the memory and knees, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, my. What kind of symptoms? Like… a fever? I don’t have a fever. I haven’t been sick, I told you. No aches, no pains… well, except for my knees, naturally. And sometimes my hands feel a little…stiff in the morning. But that's just arthritis, my mother had it. Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is sending me on a wild goose chase. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just… old. Is there something wrong with being old?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, there’s nothing wrong with being old. It’s a perfectly natural process. But it is good to rule things out, even if you feel generally well. The stiffness in your hands… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… the hands... it's been… years. Probably since I retired, maybe even a little before. It's not terrible, you know? Just a little creaky in the morning. I take some over-the-counter pain reliever sometimes, the ibuprofen. That helps a bit. My daughter keeps trying to get me to see a specialist, a rheumatologist, or something. But honestly, Doctor, I think it's just… age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned ibuprofen… how much do you typically take, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you're getting into numbers. Let me see… the bottle is… somewhere in the kitchen, I think. It's the… the pink one? No, the blue one! Wait… Two? Maybe three? I take it when my hands bother me, which is… most mornings. It’s not a regular thing, you know? Just as needed. I don't like taking pills unless I have to. My daughter keeps a very close eye on my medication, let me tell you. She's a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good your daughter is involved. It's difficult to assess without knowing the dosage you're taking. Let's move on to other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite? Well, it’s… smaller, I suppose. I don’t eat as much as I used to. Arthur always said I had a healthy appetite, but that was a long time ago. I mostly eat soup these days. Easy to digest. And toast. And… well, not a lot else. As for weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My daughter has a scale, she’s always telling me I should “monitor my numbers.” Honestly, Doctor, I haven't a clue.
DOCTOR: Alright. We're gathering information. Now, Ms. Calvery, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a personal question! Really, Doctor? Is that necessary? I… well, let's just say things aren’t as regular as they used to be. It's part of getting old, isn't it? I don’t discuss these things with strangers. My daughter asks, of course, she asks about everything. But... I'm not going to get into details with you. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Calvery. My apologies. That was perhaps too direct a question. We can certainly skip that. Let's talk about sleep. How has your sleep been lately?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Well, it comes and goes. I used to sleep like a baby, Arthur said. But now… I wake up a lot during the night. Just… little things. A noise, a thought… My bladder, mostly. I get up to use the bathroom a couple of times. It's just part of getting old, you know? I try not to drink anything before bed. That helps a little. But honestly, Doctor, I'm not sleeping as well as I used to. I think that's a given.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for sharing that. Now, Ms. Calvery, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. Just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… invasive. And if it won’t take too long. I have an appointment with my hairdresser later this afternoon, you know? And my daughter would be furious if I was late. I don’t mind a quick look, Doctor, but please be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Gentle is the word. It will be a quick exam, and I'll be as careful as possible. Please sit back, and we’ll start with your blood pressure. One hundred and forty-two over eighty-eight. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, if you could just bend your knees for me, and let me take a look. Some crepitus and mild swelling on both knees. Range of motion is limited, but no acute signs of inflammation. Alright. That’s all for now.
PATIENT: Oh. Crepitus? Is that… bad? And limited range of motion… Well, I told you my knees weren't what they used to be. Honestly, Doctor, I've been dealing with this for years. I just thought it was…age. Is there anything you can do about it? A cream, maybe? I don't want to have surgery. My daughter keeps mentioning physical therapy, but I just don't have the energy for all that.
DOCTOR: Crepitus is just the grating sound of the joint, Ms. Calvery. It’s common with osteoarthritis, which is likely what's going on in your knees. It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, but it indicates some wear and tear. As for treatment, there are options. A cream might provide some temporary relief, but it won’t address the underlying problem. Physical therapy can be helpful to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve range of motion, but I understand your hesitation. We could also consider an over-the-counter pain reliever, like the ibuprofen you mentioned, but it’s important to use it as directed. I think it would be best to get an X-ray of your knees to confirm the diagnosis and rule out anything else. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh, goodness. More tests. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. I don’t know… I don't like radiation. And I really don't want to know if there's anything "else" going on. I just want to know if I’m going to die or not. Is that too much to ask? My daughter keeps saying I need to be proactive, but honestly, all this testing is just making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns. You're right, it's perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about tests. The X-ray would simply give us a better picture of what's going on in your knees, and it doesn't involve a significant amount of radiation. It's a very common procedure. And to answer your question directly, you're not going to die, at least not anytime soon. However, knowing what's causing your knee pain can help us manage it better and improve your quality of life. We don't have to do the X-ray if you're not comfortable with it, but I do think it would be helpful. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Explain it, then. But please, keep it simple. I don't understand all that medical jargon. And no promises, you know? I still might not do it. My daughter will be furious if I don’t, but honestly, I'm tired of being poked and prodded. I just want to enjoy my remaining years in peace. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. That’s perfectly reasonable. The X-ray is a very simple procedure. You’ll simply sit or lie down while a machine takes a picture of the bones in your knees. It doesn’t involve any needles or injections. It’s completely painless. The whole process takes just a few minutes. We'll use a lead apron to protect the rest of your body from any radiation exposure, which is minimal. The pictures will help us see if there's any arthritis, bone spurs, or other issues causing your pain. We can discuss the results together and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Well… a few minutes, you say? And no needles? And minimal radiation? Hmmm. My daughter always says I worry too much. Maybe… maybe I should just get it over with. It's not like I have anything else to do today. But I want you to promise me you'll explain everything clearly, if there's something wrong. No medical jargon, remember? And I want my daughter to be there when we discuss the results. She always knows what to ask. Alright, Doctor. Let's do the X-ray. But you owe me a clear explanation, and you have to promise not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Ms. Calvery. I promise a clear explanation, no medical jargon, and I’ll make sure we don’t poke you too much. We’ll schedule the X-ray right now, and then we can set up an appointment to discuss the results together with your daughter. The radiology department is just down the hall. It shouldn’t take long. Are you able to walk there on your own, or would you like a nurse to escort you?
PATIENT: Oh, I can walk. I’m not completely helpless, you know. Though… slowly. And carefully. My knees aren’t what they used to be. But I don’t need a nurse to hold my hand. Honestly, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I can manage. Just point me in the right direction, and I'll be fine. And… thank you. For not poking me too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. Just down that hallway, on your left. The receptionist will check you in. And don't hesitate to ask if you need any help. I’ll see you back here after the X-ray. And remember, no worries. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think I can manage. I suppose I should get this over with.
