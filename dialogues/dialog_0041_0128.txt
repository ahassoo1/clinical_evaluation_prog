DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think… It’s my joints, I think. They feel… stiff. Mostly in the mornings. It's just… hard to get going, you know? Like an old rusty door.
DOCTOR: Right, stiff joints, especially in the mornings. I understand. That “old rusty door” feeling is a pretty good way to describe it. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That's a tricky one. A while, I think. Not terribly long… but not just yesterday, that's for sure. Maybe… a few months? It comes and goes, really. Some days are better than others. I’m sorry, I’m not very good with dates. My husband always remembered those things.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Lilliana, dates aren’t important right now. "A few months" gives me a good starting point. Does anything specifically seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… well, being cold definitely doesn’t help. And maybe… if I’ve been sitting for too long? It's hard to say. I don’t really… do much these days, so it’s not like I’m running marathons and then feeling stiff! I mostly just… watch TV with the grandkids when they visit. It feels a bit better after I get moving, though. A little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather and prolonged sitting seem to be triggers, and movement helps a bit. That’s good information. And you mentioned it comes and goes. Where exactly are you feeling the stiffness the most?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly in my hands, I think. And my knees. Sometimes my hips too, but… not all the time. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? It's sort of… all over. I do a lot of baking with the grandkids, so maybe my hands are just… tired from that?
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Baking with the grandkids is lovely, but can definitely be hard on the hands. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say “stiff,” is it painful, or more of a… difficulty moving?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not really pain, no. More… achy, I guess. And just hard to bend my fingers sometimes. Like they're… glued together a little. It’s not sharp, or anything. Just… not as easy as they used to be. I can still do things, but it takes a bit more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy and difficulty moving, not sharp pain. Good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints—your hands, knees, or hips?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I haven't really looked, to be honest. I don't think so… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My hands sometimes feel a little… thicker, maybe? But I thought that was just… age. I don’t know if that’s swelling or not. I’m really not very good at noticing those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no obvious swelling noticed. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions. Have you had any fever, fatigue, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no fever. Definitely no weight loss – if anything, I could lose a little! And… fatigue? Well, I get tired easily, but that’s just… being my age, isn’t it? I don’t feel sick tired, just… regular tired. It's hard to explain. I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lilliana. Thank you for clarifying. And yes, fatigue can definitely come with age! One more question before we do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Do you have any family history of arthritis, or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Let me think… My mother, I think… she had something with her hands. But I was young, and it was a long time ago. I don't remember exactly what it was. It was something that made it hard for her to knit, I think. And… maybe an aunt? But I really don't remember the details. Sorry, I’m not much help with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible family history of some sort of joint problem, but not sure of details. That’s alright, we work with what we’ve got. I’m going to take a quick look at your hands and knees, just to see what I can observe. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm not shy. Just be gentle, okay? My hands aren't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just feel around here… And can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh… there we go. That’s… not as easy as it looks. It feels a bit tight, you know? And a little bit sore, now that you’re poking around.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little bit of tenderness and some mild swelling around the knuckles. Now, can you bend your fingers all the way down, like you’re making a hook?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Not very far, I'm afraid. It… gets stuck a bit. And it feels a bit uncomfortable if I push it too hard. I don't want to make it worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s have a look at your knees… I’m just going to bend them a little bit for you. Can you point your toes up towards the ceiling?
PATIENT: Oh, there we go. Not very high, I’m afraid. They feel… creaky. Like an old rocking chair. And a little bit stiff, even after getting moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of tenderness when I press here, and some stiffness. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, where the cartilage in your joints begins to break down. It can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion, like you've been describing. However, to be certain, and to rule out anything else, I'd like to order some X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… X-rays? Oh my. I don't like the sound of that. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I’ve never had those before. What will it show? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No worries at all about being nervous, Lilliana. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The X-rays will help us to visualize the bones and cartilage in your hands and knees and see the extent of any damage or changes. It won't hurt at all—the machine just sends a small amount of radiation through your body, like a quick flash of light. You'll stand or sit very still for a few moments while the pictures are taken. It's a very safe and quick procedure. Do you have any concerns about the cost of the X-rays?
PATIENT: Oh, well… that sounds alright, if it doesn't hurt. A flash of light, you say? Hmm… The cost… oh dear. That's always a worry. I'm a widow, you know, and I don't have much saved. I’m not insured, I’m afraid. I try to get by, but things are tight. Will it be very expensive?
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. It's good you brought that up. Being uninsured can make things very difficult. The X-rays themselves usually cost around $200-$300. Let me see if the clinic has any programs to help with the cost, or if there are any lower-cost imaging centers nearby. I’ll also check if there are any financial assistance options available to you. In the meantime, while we wait to get the X-rays scheduled, we can start with some simple things to help manage your symptoms. Have you tried over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor, if you could check on the cost for me. Thank you so much. Ibuprofen… hmm, I think I've taken that before, yes. For headaches, mostly. But I don't take it very often. I worry about my stomach, you know? My daughter always tells me not to take too much. Does it help with the joints, though?
DOCTOR: It can help with the joint pain and inflammation, Lilliana. However, your daughter is right to be cautious! Ibuprofen can sometimes upset your stomach, especially if taken regularly or in high doses. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. If it bothers your stomach, we can explore other options, like acetaminophen, or topical creams. In addition to pain relievers, gentle exercises, like walking or swimming, can help to keep your joints moving and strengthen the muscles around them. Also, applying heat or cold packs to your joints can provide temporary relief. Do you have any difficulty with walking or other activities?
PATIENT: Oh, walking isn't too bad, no. But I don’t walk very far. Mostly just around the house, or to the mailbox. Swimming… oh, I used to love swimming, but it’s been years. I don’t really have anyone to go with anymore. And I’m a bit afraid of getting changed, you know? It's hard getting in and out of the water when you're… well, when you're my age. And those creams… what kind are they? Do they smell funny? I don't like strong smells.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. That’s perfectly reasonable. And you're right, it's always easier doing things with someone else! We can definitely start with just small steps, like a gentle walk around the house and see how that goes. The creams are topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and there are also creams with capsaicin. They can help to reduce pain and inflammation directly on the joint. There are some that have a mild smell, but we can definitely find one that’s unscented or has a very faint aroma. Now, while we're waiting for the X-rays, let's focus on what we can do to help you feel more comfortable. Do you have any questions about the exercise, the creams, or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: Oh, well… the exercise sounds good, but I worry about falling. I don’t want to break anything. And the creams… capsaicin? Is that spicy? I don't like spicy food. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It's completely understandable to be concerned about falling, so we will definitely start slowly and safely. We can discuss some balance exercises, and it's always a good idea to have someone nearby when you're starting out. And yes, capsaicin is the ingredient that makes peppers spicy, but the creams have a very low concentration, and most people don't experience any burning sensation. I’m going to write up a plan for you, including recommendations for gentle exercises, pain relief options, and some resources for finding support groups or exercise classes in the area. I’ll also get the X-ray order for you and we can schedule those. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds wonderful, Doctor. A plan would be very helpful. And if you could write it down nice and big, that would be good, too. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. Thank you so much for your help. You’ve made me feel much better already.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help. I'll definitely write it down in large print for you. Let me just finish up charting our conversation and then I’ll get that plan ready. It will take me a few minutes. In the meantime, do you have any other health concerns I should be aware of, or any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Hmm. I have a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes. And my blood pressure is a little high, my daughter says. She checks it when she visits. I take something for that… a little white pill. I think it's called… Lisinopril? Yes, that's it. Just one every morning. And that’s about it, I think. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor told me to, because I don't get much sunshine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for your blood pressure and a Vitamin D supplement. Good to know. Alright, I’ve added those to your chart. Now I’m writing up the plan… gentle walking, start with 5-10 minutes a day, gradually increase as tolerated. We’ll also discuss some balance exercises and I'm including information on over-the-counter pain relief options, and some resources for support groups in the area. The X-ray order is ready, and my assistant will schedule that for you before you leave. Here's the plan. Please read through it at your own pace, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Do you have any questions right now about the plan or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, writing it so big. I can see it much better. Let me just… Hmm, yes, walking… balance exercises… support groups… It all sounds very good, Doctor. I don’t think I have any questions right now. I'll read it over a few more times at home, and then I'll call if anything comes to mind. Thank you so much for everything. You’ve been very patient and helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. I'm glad I could help. Remember, take it slow, listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My assistant will escort you to the scheduling desk now. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again. Have a good day to you as well.
