DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Lessie, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s not really a problem, you understand. More… a niceness I was hoping for. My daughter, she says I should get a card. A “get well” card, or maybe one with… encouragement. Just something from a real doctor, you know? It’s silly, I suppose. But she worries so.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all, Janeth. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter, and I’m happy to help if I can provide a little peace of mind. So, it sounds like you’re generally feeling well, but your daughter is concerned and would like some documentation of your health?
PATIENT: Documentation? Oh, she makes it sound so…official. No, no, it’s not about proving anything. She just… likes things neat. And she thinks a card from a doctor will cheer her up more than it’ll cheer me up. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. I’ve been making my momos, you know? And they are excellent this year, if I do say so myself. A sick person can’t make momos like this!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Janeth! Excellent momos are a very good sign. So, just to be clear, you're feeling well, with no current complaints, and you’d like a note simply to reassure your daughter?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A note. Saying… saying what? That I’m not falling apart? That I’m still capable? Oh, goodness, this is ridiculous. Just something polite, Doctor. Something a doctor would write to… a worried daughter. It doesn't need to be long. Honestly, I don’t even understand why she brought me here. She worries over nothing, that girl. Still, better to humor her, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It’s very kind of you to come in to ease her worries. Let me just document that you are presenting today feeling well, with no acute complaints. To give me a more complete picture for the note, could you briefly tell me about any medical conditions you have been diagnosed with in the past, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about… history? Honestly, Doctor, that was a long time ago. I’ve lived a full life, you know? But… let me think. There was my gallbladder, years and years ago. Removed it, they did. And… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be. But who isn’t complaining about their knees these days? Nothing serious, really. I’ve always been quite strong. Strong bones, you see. Nepalese women are resilient.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Janeth. So, past surgical history of gallbladder removal, and some knee discomfort. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not those things. Never had any trouble with my heart. Always a strong ticker, that one. And my blood pressure… well, I don’t even know what that is, to be honest. They check it at the market sometimes, when I buy spices. Always says it’s “fine”. Always fine! I eat very healthily, you know. Lots of ginger and garlic. And turmeric. That's good for everything, they say. My mother always told me.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Janeth. It sounds like you prioritize a very healthy lifestyle. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, just the usual things. For my… well, for getting older. You know, aches and pains. Nothing fancy. A little something for my joints. And sometimes, when it rains, something for my knees. I don't remember the names, honestly. My daughter handles all that. She brings the little bottles. I just take them when she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some over-the-counter medications for aches and pains and your knees, managed by your daughter. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, no, not really. I can’t stand cilantro, if that counts. It tastes like soap, honestly. But that’s not an allergy, is it? I eat everything else. Spices, fruits, vegetables… all sorts of things. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not in my life. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes if I eat too much chili. But who can resist a good chili?
DOCTOR: No, cilantro doesn’t count as an allergy, Janeth. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about my relatives? Honestly, Doctor, that’s a long story. My mother lived to be ninety-five, if you can believe it. Very strong woman. My father… well, he wasn't so lucky. He had some trouble with his breathing, when he got older. And my brother… he had problems with his stomach. But everyone gets something, don’t they? Honestly, I don’t know much more than that. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn't considered polite.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janeth. And finally, do you have any lifestyle habits – smoking, alcohol consumption, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Smoking? Never! And alcohol… just a little bit of rakshi sometimes, during festivals. Very little. It’s traditional, you see. And I drink it with my family, not every day. Mostly, I drink tea. Lots and lots of tea. And I walk every day, to the market and back. Keeps me fit. I'm a very practical woman. I don't need any bad habits.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Janeth. That gives me a very good understanding of your health history. It sounds like you are a very active and healthy individual, and your daughter’s concerns are likely unfounded. To reassure her, I can write a note stating that you are in good general health, with a history of gallbladder removal, some knee discomfort, and that you take over-the-counter medications as needed. I will also mention your healthy lifestyle habits and that you have no known allergies. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Absolutely perfect. Just something polite, to make her happy. You’re a very good doctor, you know. Very thorough. And you didn’t even make me feel silly for coming here just for a card! Honestly, she worries too much, that girl. But… it’s nice to know I have someone like you looking after me, even if it's just to write a little note.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Janeth. I’m happy to help. Here you go. Please feel free to take your time and review it. It's addressed to your daughter, and I've also included my contact information should she have any questions. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s lovely, thank you. Let me see… Yes, that’s perfect. Exactly what she needs to hear. You even wrote that I’m a “practical woman”! She’ll be so pleased. No, Doctor, I don’t think there’s anything else. You’ve been wonderful. Truly. Just… thank you again. And perhaps… you should try some momos sometime. My daughter makes them too, but… mine are better, of course.
DOCTOR: I will definitely keep that in mind, Janeth! It sounds like a delicious proposition. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and please give my best to your daughter.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor! And thank you again for everything. You’re a very kind doctor.
