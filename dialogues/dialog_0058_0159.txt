DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah Fratoni. 26 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hey Doc. It’s… well, it’s kinda embarrassing, but I’m havin’ trouble gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then… I just can’t push myself up easy. It’s been happenin’ for a couple weeks now, gettin’ worse each time. Mostly just normal chairs, you know? Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Trouble getting out of chairs, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not into ‘em, just… up and out. It’s like my legs just… don’t wanna cooperate. It ain’t a pain thing, not really. More like… they’re stuck. I gotta really heave sometimes, and even then it’s slow. Makes me feel kinda weak, honestly. And my wife… well, she’s not here anymore, so I don’t have anyone to help me, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. And this is primarily with normal chairs, not, say, low-to-the-ground or overly soft ones?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Normal chairs. Kitchen chairs, office chairs at work… even some of the benches down at the park. It don’t seem to matter. Though, I guess… low ones are a bit harder. Like, the real low picnic table benches? Those are definitely worse. But even normal ones are givin’ me trouble now. It started slow, kinda just a little effort, but now… now it’s a real struggle. I work out in the oil fields, so I’m used to bein’ physical, you know? This just… doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Oil fields, you say. And you’re accustomed to physical labor. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this difficulty?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Roughneck work, mostly. Let me think… No, not really. No pain, like I said. No numbness or tingly feelings in my legs. I ain’t fallin’ or anything. Just… this chair thing. I have been kinda tired lately, but that’s normal, with the job and all. Long days, you know? Sometimes my legs feel… heavy, but that could just be from bein’ on my feet all day. Honestly, I thought maybe I was just overworked, but it’s been a couple weeks now and it ain’t gettin’ better. And like I said, my wife… she always knew what was wrong, and now I’m kinda on my own figurin’ things out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, when you say “tired,” is that general fatigue, or is it more muscle weakness specifically?
PATIENT: Good question. It’s… both, I guess. I just feel worn out, like I haven’t slept even when I have. And my muscles do feel weaker. Not like, can’t-lift-things weak, but… like they take more effort to use. Even just walkin’ up the stairs feels harder than it used to. And like, at work, I used to be able to haul stuff around no problem, now I gotta take more breaks. It’s… subtle, but it’s there. It’s just… frustrating. I don’t wanna slow down the crew, you know? I need to be pullin’ my weight.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’re going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I'm going to check your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. It’s… a little harder than it looks, sorry about that. Feels kinda shaky, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. There, like that. It feels… off, kinda like my legs aren’t fully under my control. It’s not a bad limp or anything, just… not smooth, you know? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. No obvious swelling or tenderness. Now, I’m going to have you sit back down. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: There. It’s… harder goin’ down than standin’ up, I think. Like I gotta brace myself. And it feels… tight, in my hips, maybe? It's hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s just… not easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, your reflexes are… a little diminished. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hand with your legs. First, push with your right leg.
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? I’m tryin’ to push as hard as I can, but it feels kinda weak, honestly. Not like I’m straining or anything, just… not as strong as it used to be. It's hard to describe, kinda like pushin’ through mud or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now your left leg. Push against my hand as hard as you can.
PATIENT: There. It feels… even weaker on this side, I think. Like, I really gotta concentrate to push. It's kinda frustratin', honestly. I used to be able to do this without even thinkin’ about it. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the preliminary exam, it seems like you may be experiencing some weakness in your legs, and possibly some difficulty with hip flexion. It’s too early to say for sure what's going on, but we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, and your muscle enzymes. We may also need to consider an MRI to get a better look at your hips and legs. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had an MRI before, so I ain’t had any dye or anything. I’m good, I think. Just… this all sounds kinda serious, doesn't it? I mean, I just thought I was tired, maybe overworked. I didn't think it was gonna be… all this. An MRI sounds expensive, too. I ain’t exactly got a lot of money saved up. My wife… she always handled the insurance stuff, and I'm still kinda lost without her. I don’t even know if I have insurance anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood work is fairly standard, and we can discuss payment options for the MRI if it becomes necessary. As for insurance, let's take a look. Do you have any cards or paperwork with insurance information on it?
PATIENT: Uh… I think I have somethin’ in my wallet. Here. This is… her card, from when she was workin’. I don't know if it’s still valid or if it even covers me anymore. She worked at the hospital, you know, over in the city. I haven't even thought about this since… well, since she passed. It's probably useless. I just… I haven't gotten around to dealin' with it. It’s hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. It appears her insurance is still active, but it's a hospital employee plan, and it may have limited coverage for things outside of their network. Also, it doesn't look like you're currently listed as a dependent. We'll need to contact the insurance company to see if we can get you added, and understand what's covered. It might be a bit of a process, but we'll figure it out. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for some multivitamins, just to rule out any deficiencies. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist. They’re the specialists for muscle weakness and neurological issues, and they'll be able to order the MRI and get a more definitive diagnosis. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good, I guess. A neurologist… that sounds serious. But I guess I gotta do whatever it takes to figure out what’s goin’ on. My wife… she always said I was stubborn, wouldn't go to the doctor unless I absolutely had to. I guess this is absolutely havin’ to, huh? I appreciate you helpin' me with the insurance stuff. It’s a weight off my shoulders, honestly. And the multivitamins… can’t hurt, I guess. What kinda neurologist are we talkin’? Like, close to here, or do I gotta drive all the way into the city? That's a long drive…
DOCTOR: There are a few neurologists in the network. Dr. Eleanor Vance has an office about twenty minutes from here, and she specializes in neuromuscular disorders. She's highly recommended. This referral slip has her contact information and directions. I also included a couple of others further away, just in case. As for the drive, I understand it's not ideal, but she's the most qualified in the area for what you're experiencing. We need to get a proper diagnosis, and sometimes that means a bit of travel. Do you have any questions about the referral, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, Dr. Vance… twenty minutes is doable. I can manage that. And I guess I don’t have any more questions right now. It’s a lot to take in, honestly. Just… thankful for your help. And the multivitamins. And tryin’ to sort out the insurance. I really appreciate it, Doc. I guess I’ll give Dr. Vance’s office a call and see if I can get an appointment. Thanks again, Doc. I think… I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Elijiah. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll get this figured out. .
