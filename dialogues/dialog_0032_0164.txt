DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 51 years old. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 51, that's right. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’m kind of…yellowish. It started after I ate some fava beans a few days ago. I just thought I was a little sick, but it hasn’t gone away. It's making me worry.
DOCTOR: Yellowish, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, my skin…and even the whites of my eyes are a bit yellow. It's hard to explain, but it's definitely noticeable. My daughter pointed it out. She was quite concerned, which is why I decided to come in. I haven't felt well enough to really do much, so I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I see. And this occurred shortly after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I had them with dinner, maybe three or four days ago. I like them, they remind me of my grandmother’s cooking. But after that meal, I just started feeling weaker, and then I noticed the colour change. It's… a little scary, because I don’t understand why beans would do this to me.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Haggar, it's good you came in to have this evaluated. While many things can cause fatigue and jaundice – and it’s important we investigate thoroughly – the timing relative to the fava beans is… pertinent. Have you experienced anything like this before, after eating fava beans, or any other foods for that matter?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been eating fava beans on and off for years, as I said, since I was a little girl. And I’ve never had any problems like this before. Nothing at all. I eat a pretty normal diet, mostly vegetables and fish. I haven’t changed anything else recently, not that I can think of. This is completely new. I don't even know what 'jaundice' is, to be honest. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Jaundice simply refers to the yellowing of the skin and eyes, usually due to a build-up of bilirubin. It can indicate a more serious underlying condition, which is why we need to investigate. Now, let's get a more complete picture. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a daily multivitamin, that's it. And, honestly, I don't get sick very often. I'm usually very healthy. I was a bit worried when I started feeling tired, because I normally have plenty of energy. It's just…strange. Is it something in the beans? Like a bad batch or something? I wouldn't want my daughter to eat them if they're going to make her sick.
DOCTOR: It’s possible, though less likely. There is a genetic condition – G6PD deficiency – that can cause a reaction like this after exposure to certain substances, fava beans being one of them. It’s more common in certain ethnic groups. Now, to rule things in or out, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination and order some blood work. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work…yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. G6PD…that sounds complicated. Is that something you can test for? I don't know anything about genetics. And I'm Romanian, if that's relevant to…whatever that is. A physical exam is fine too, of course. I just want to figure out what's going on and get back to feeling myself again. It's just been so tiring.
DOCTOR: Yes, G6PD deficiency is a genetic condition, and it is more prevalent in some populations, including those of Romanian descent. The blood work will tell us definitively. First, let’s begin with the examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver or spleen. Then, I'll examine your skin more closely. If you could please lie down on the examination table, we'll get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Here. Is this okay? It feels a bit…clinical. But I understand you need to do this to find out what’s wrong. Please, just tell me what you’re doing as you go along. I always feel better when I know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Haggar. I’ll explain everything as I go along. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale slowly. Your breathing sounds clear. Now, I will listen to your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little…sensitive, maybe, but not painful. It feels…full, I suppose. I haven't been eating as much lately, being so tired, but I haven’t had any trouble with…digestion, or anything. It just feels…odd. And I keep feeling a little bit cold, even though it’s quite warm in here.
DOCTOR: Alright. The abdomen is soft, no masses palpable. Yes, as you mentioned, there is definite scleral icterus – yellowing of the whites of your eyes. Your skin tone also appears slightly jaundiced, though not severely. Based on the physical examination, and your history, we'll need to run a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a liver function test, and a G6PD enzyme assay to rule out G6PD deficiency. I’ll also order a bilirubin level to assess the extent of the jaundice. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s happening. It’s unlikely, but we’ll also check a reticulocyte count to assess bone marrow function. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the blood work?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s…a lot of tests. Reticulocyte…what does that even mean? And bone marrow? Is something wrong with my bones? It sounds quite serious. Will these tests tell us for sure what’s causing this? And…how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what I'm dealing with. I'm a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Haggar. It is a lot of tests, but that’s simply to be thorough and rule out any potential underlying causes. A reticulocyte count assesses how quickly your bone marrow is producing new red blood cells. It doesn’t mean anything is necessarily wrong with your bones, it's simply a measure of blood cell production. These tests will provide us with a great deal of information and help us determine the cause of your jaundice and fatigue. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. Once we have them, we'll discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan, if needed. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid fava beans, as they are likely triggering the reaction. Also, please let me know immediately if you experience any abdominal pain, fever, or dark urine. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Okay. No fava beans. And watch for pain, fever, dark urine. I can remember that. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours…that seems like a long time, but I understand. It's good to know you’re being thorough. What if it is the G6PD? Is that something serious? And is there anything I can do now, before the results come back, to make myself feel a little better? I'm just so tired all the time. A little bit of reassurance would be nice, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: G6PD deficiency itself isn’t typically life-threatening, but it requires management to avoid triggers. Avoiding fava beans and certain medications is key. In the meantime, while we await the results, focus on getting adequate rest and hydration. A light, easily digestible diet is also advisable. Unfortunately, there isn’t a quick fix for the fatigue at this point, but minimizing stress and ensuring proper nutrition may help. I understand your concern, Ms. Haggar. I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. We’ll proceed systematically, and I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. A nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood samples. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve made me feel a little bit better, just knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. I'll try to rest and stay hydrated. And definitely no more fava beans. I appreciate your patience. .
