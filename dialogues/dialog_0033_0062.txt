DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Knabenshue, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Rayshun Knabenshue. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, is it? I appreciate you taking the time to see me today.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. Look, I have a rather full schedule, so if we could just get straight to the point… What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As the paperwork likely indicates, I'm here regarding the new policy about masks at my workplace. It's… causing a bit of a problem for me, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and the masks make things difficult, honestly.
DOCTOR: A mask exemption… Right. And what specifically makes it “difficult”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a bit hard to explain, Doctor. It’s not… a physical discomfort, exactly. More like… a feeling. A heavy feeling, like something is pressing on me. It makes it hard to concentrate, and my job requires a lot of focus when dealing with people. It also… stirs up old feelings, if that makes any sense. It’s hard to be calm and reassuring when I’m feeling… closed in. It affects my ability to do my work safely, for everyone involved.
DOCTOR: Old feelings?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's... difficult to put into words. My family… we have a history, a long history with things covering the face. It brings up memories, not good ones. It's a cultural thing, really. Things that obscure the face aren't… well, they aren’t comfortable for me, and it impacts my ability to stay grounded and present when I need to be. It’s hard to explain without getting into a lot of detail about Lakota traditions and history. Would that be helpful? Or are you more interested in how it affects my work?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, I’m a physician, not a historian. I need medical information. What specific symptoms are you experiencing when you wear the mask?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. You’re right to ask for specifics. It’s not a simple thing to explain. When I wear the mask, I feel… a tightening in my chest, like anxiety. My heart races a bit. It’s not a painful feeling, but it’s… unsettling. I also find it hard to breathe deeply, even though the mask isn’t physically restricting my airflow. It’s more like… a panic feeling coming on, and I struggle to focus, and I become easily agitated. I also get these… flashes of memories, and it makes it hard to think clearly. It’s like my mind is racing, and I’m not fully present. It’s hard to stay calm and rational, which is essential in my line of work. Would you like me to elaborate on any of those symptoms?
DOCTOR: Anxiety… Right. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with anything, to be honest. I’ve always been a fairly… stoic person. We don’t really… go to doctors much in my community. We handle things internally, if that makes sense. This feeling is new, brought on by the mask requirement. It’s not something I’ve experienced before. It’s… specifically tied to wearing the mask, not a general anxiety about other things. Does that clarify anything?
DOCTOR: So, you’re saying this is a new onset anxiety specifically triggered by a piece of fabric over your face?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. That sums it up pretty well, actually. A new onset of anxiety, specifically triggered by wearing a mask. It's not a general anxiety, and it didn’t exist before the mask requirement at work. It’s… a direct correlation, as far as I can tell. It makes it very difficult to do my job effectively, and I worry about making mistakes or not being able to respond appropriately in a crisis. It's a concerning situation for both myself and the people I work with.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I’m not convinced this warrants a medical exemption. It sounds… situational. Have you tried any relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: I understand your skepticism, Doctor. It does sound unusual, I admit. And no, I haven’t tried any formal relaxation techniques. Like I said, we don’t really… do that in my community. We traditionally handle these things through… storytelling and spending time with elders, but that’s not really practical at work, unfortunately. I’m willing to try anything that might help, though. Do you have any suggestions? Perhaps something simple I could do before or during my shift? I'm open to any ideas you might have.
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose we could try a simple breathing exercise. Box breathing, perhaps. But frankly, I think you’re overreacting. A mask is a minor inconvenience. Have you considered just… pushing through it?
PATIENT: I appreciate the suggestion, Doctor, and I’m willing to try the breathing exercise. But I respectfully disagree that it’s a minor inconvenience. It’s not simply about discomfort; it’s about my ability to function safely and effectively in a demanding job. And “pushing through it” isn’t really a viable option, unfortunately. It actively impacts my judgment and makes me prone to mistakes, which could have serious consequences for the people I serve. It's not a matter of willpower, it's a genuine physiological response. It feels… destabilizing. Is there anything else we could discuss? Perhaps alternative solutions, like a different type of mask, or accommodations at work?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients waiting. I’m not going to spend all day dissecting your cultural sensitivities. I’m a physician, not a therapist. I’m not comfortable writing a medical exemption based on this… subjective discomfort. I suggest you speak to your employer about accommodations. But I won’t be providing a medical justification. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: I understand you're busy, Doctor, and I appreciate your time. I wasn’t asking you to dissect my cultural sensitivities, only to consider the physiological impact this is having on me. It’s not subjective discomfort; it’s a genuine response that affects my ability to perform my job safely. However, if you’re not comfortable providing a medical justification, that’s your prerogative. I’m… disappointed, but I respect your decision. In that case, no, there’s nothing else. Thank you for hearing me out, Doctor. .
