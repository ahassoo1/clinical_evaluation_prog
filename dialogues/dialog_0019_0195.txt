DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... alright. Honestly, it's a bit silly, really. I just thought... well, my daughter said I should come get a little note from a real doctor. A “get well” card, she called it. Just to… encourage me, she said. You know how these things are with family. It's not like I'm sick sick. More… low spirits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Sometimes a little reassurance, even with a note for peace of mind, is exactly what we need. “Low spirits” is a perfectly valid reason to come see a doctor, Janeth. We want to make sure everything is alright. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me a bit more about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… everything, really. My husband, he’s been… difficult lately. Always complaining. And the neighbors, they just don’t understand how things are done properly. Everything’s going downhill, you see? It’s just… exhausting, keeping everything together. And then my daughter keeps saying I need to “relax,” as if that’s easy! Honestly, it’s just a lot. I don’t even know why I’m telling you all this. It’s not like you can fix it.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re carrying a lot on your shoulders, Janeth. And it's perfectly okay to share all of this with me. Sometimes just talking about it can help. It’s not silly at all to feel overwhelmed when dealing with difficult situations – a difficult husband and ununderstanding neighbors sound…challenging, to say the least. You mentioned feeling exhausted. Has this exhaustion been recent, or has it been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while, now. Years, really. It comes and goes, but it’s mostly always there, a little bit. Like a dull ache, you know? Not a physical ache, exactly, but… inside. And then I try to keep everything tidy and proper, keep the house looking nice, cook good meals for my husband… it’s just a lot of work. He doesn’t appreciate it, of course. He just finds something to complain about. Honestly, I don't know what he wants. It’s like… trying to please someone who doesn’t want to be pleased.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this feeling of exhaustion, along with trying to manage things at home and feeling unappreciated, has been going on for years. That sounds incredibly draining, Janeth. Aside from the exhaustion, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Well… I haven’t been sleeping very well. I wake up in the middle of the night, thinking about everything I need to do. And then I can’t get back to sleep. And… I haven't been enjoying my cooking lately. I used to love to make traditional Nepali dishes, but now… it just feels like a chore. No flavor, you know? Even I don’t want to eat it. It's ridiculous, really. A good cook shouldn't lose her taste for it.
DOCTOR: That’s not ridiculous at all, Janeth. Losing interest in things you used to enjoy is a significant change, and it’s definitely something worth talking about. Sleep disturbance and loss of appetite are common when someone’s feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Have you experienced any changes in your weight or appetite overall?
PATIENT: Well… I think I’ve lost a little weight, now that you mention it. Not much, but my clothes feel a bit looser. And I don’t really feel hungry, even when I know I should eat. I just… pick at my food. Mostly just to keep my husband happy, you see. He gets upset if I don’t eat enough. It’s just another thing. Honestly, everything feels like a… performance, you know? Just pretending everything is alright.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re carrying a tremendous emotional burden, Janeth, and it’s understandable that it’s affecting your appetite and weight. It sounds exhausting to feel like you’re constantly performing. Before we go further, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I haven’t been to a doctor in years. I don’t really like doctors, you see. I had some trouble with my knees a few years back, but it mostly sorts itself out with some rest. Nothing serious. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, my daughter keeps telling me to watch it. But I mostly just ignore her. I don't take any medicine, though. I prefer to handle things myself. It's better that way, you see. Less fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for handling things yourself, Janeth. And it’s good you’ve been managing with rest for your knees. However, high blood pressure, even if it’s mild, is important to monitor. It can lead to other health problems if left unchecked. Do you know what your blood pressure readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. My daughter has one of those machines, she keeps trying to make me use it. But I always say no. Honestly, I don’t like knowing numbers. It just makes me anxious, you see? Numbers are for… well, for people who like numbers. I prefer to just feel how I am. If I feel alright, then I am alright. It’s as simple as that. She worries too much, that girl. Always fussing over everything. Honestly, it's just… stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly reasonable to prefer going by how you feel. However, sometimes our bodies can tell us one thing, and the numbers can reveal something else. With your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall health. It might give us a better understanding of what’s going on, and it would help me feel more comfortable knowing we’ve covered all our bases. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… well. I suppose. But quickly, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And don't tell me too many numbers, alright? Just tell me if everything is… generally alright. I have things to do, you see. My husband expects dinner, and then I need to tidy the garden before it gets dark. Honestly, it's a lot to manage. But quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janeth. Quickly and gently. I promise to keep the numbers to a minimum and focus on the overall picture. Okay, let's start with your heart. Take a few deep breaths for me… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Now, lungs… deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling. Okay, blood pressure is… 148 over 92. It's a little elevated, as your daughter suspected, but not drastically so. I'll make a note of that. Pulse is regular. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems generally okay physically, although your blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… 148, you say? That doesn't sound very good, does it? My daughter will be pleased she was right. Honestly, she always thinks she knows best. But generally alright, you say? That's good. As long as nothing is… seriously wrong. I really should get going now. My husband will be expecting dinner, and the garden needs weeding. Honestly, it's a lot to manage. So… about that note? For encouragement, you said? Is that something you can just… write quickly? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Janeth. I can certainly write a quick note for you. And 148/92 isn't alarmingly high, but it does suggest we should monitor it. We can discuss some strategies for that – perhaps some simple lifestyle changes. Here you go. It says, “Janeth Micucci is doing well. Encouragement and support recommended.” Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… alright, I suppose. It's a bit short, isn't it? But it will do. My daughter will probably want to read it, just to make sure it says the right things. Honestly, she always has to have the last word. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s everything. It was… alright. Not too much fuss, which is good. I really should be going now. Dinner won't cook itself, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. I’m glad we could get this sorted. And please, don’t hesitate to come back if you’re feeling overwhelmed or if anything changes. Remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of everything else. If you'd be open to it, I can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your blood pressure and maybe explore some ways to manage stress. Otherwise, have a good evening, and enjoy your dinner. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
