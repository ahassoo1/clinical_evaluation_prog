DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she wants… she and her husband, they want a baby. And she thought… she thought I should come talk to someone first. About… things. Before… you know. It's preconception counseling, right? That's what she said. I don't really understand all the words, but that's the idea.
DOCTOR: Preconception counseling, yes. That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very thoughtful of your daughter, and a good idea to get things checked out beforehand. It is a bit complicated, as you say. Hmm… Let’s start with you. Just to get a general picture. Can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… Well, I work. Sales… engineering things. Lots of travel, used to be more anyway. I'm… okay, I guess? No big problems. I get tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I can’t even remember when. No regular check-ups, nothing like that. I don't really… get sick often. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, yes. Traveling sales… that can be demanding. And not having seen a doctor regularly… alright. We'll definitely get things up to date. Now, do you have any ongoing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I don’t think so. My wife… my late wife, she had some problems with her heart, but I don't think I do. Diabetes? No, I don't think I have that either. I used to be a bit heavy, but I lost weight. Nothing… serious. I really don't remember any doctor telling me about anything like that. It was a long time ago, and… well, things get forgotten. I don’t take any pills regularly, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known chronic conditions, no regular medications. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Let me think… when I was a boy, I broke my arm, playing football. Had a cast on for weeks. And… when my wife was sick, I spent a lot of time in the hospital, with her. But that wasn’t for me. As for surgeries… no, I don't think I’ve ever had an operation. Nothing major. I’m pretty sure. It was… a long time ago, all this. Things… blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Broken arm as a child, time spent in the hospital with your wife – but no surgeries for you personally. We’re getting a good picture. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my daughter, she’s the one who wanted me to come here. She's healthy, as far as I know. And her husband, he's a good man. Strong. My wife… she had some troubles, as I said. Her mother… she lived a long life, but she had arthritis, I think. My father… he died when I was young. Heart trouble, they said. And my mother… she had a weak chest, always coughing. That's all I really remember. It’s… hard to recall details. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother-in-law, and some respiratory issues in your mother. That's useful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I work. A lot. Used to travel more, like I said, but now it's mostly on the phone, video calls. I eat… reasonably. Not a lot of fast food, mostly home-cooked meals. My daughter makes sure of that when she visits. I don't really… exercise much. I walk a bit, when I’m travelling. But that’s about it. And… I used to smoke, years ago. But I quit. A long time ago now. I do drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner. Nothing heavy. Is that what you mean by lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Former smoker, occasional alcohol use, moderate diet, limited exercise. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of hay fever sometimes, in the spring. But that's all. I don't break out in rashes, don't have trouble breathing… nothing like that. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything. Honestly, I think I'm pretty allergy-free. I’ve eaten… lots of different foods over the years, travelling, you know. No problems.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I see here you’re 66 years old. Given it’s been a while since you’ve seen a doctor, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and run some basic blood tests just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… and blood tests? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I haven't had blood taken in… years. Is it going to be painful? And how long will it take? I have… a conference call later this afternoon. I just want to make sure I'm not… holding things up. It’s okay, but just… let me know what to expect. I don’t really like needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Verrall. It's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. The blood draw won't be too painful, just a quick pinch. It'll take about 15-20 minutes for the physical exam and another 10-15 minutes for the blood draw. We can definitely get you in and out before your conference call. The physical exam will be fairly basic – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking at your throat, checking your reflexes, things like that. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… Fifteen minutes for the exam, ten for the blood… alright. Yes, that sounds… manageable. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't want to miss my call. And… is there anything I need to do before the exam? Should I… not eat anything? Or drink anything? I always forget these things. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best. Is it alright if my daughter comes with me? She might remind me of… everything.
DOCTOR: That's a very good idea to have your daughter with you, Mr. Verrall. She can certainly help. You don’t need to fast beforehand for the exam, but please avoid drinking caffeine for a couple of hours before. And you might want to wear something comfortable. We’ll start with the physical exam, and then we’ll move on to the blood draw. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… avoid caffeine, wear comfortable clothes, and my daughter can come. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, all of this. It's been so long since I've been to a doctor. I’m trusting you, Doctor. That’s all. Let’s… let's just get it over with. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Wonderful. We'll start with your blood pressure, right here. Just relax your arm, and I'll do the rest. Your daughter is welcome to sit nearby. Don’t worry, we'll take it one step at a time.
