DOCTOR: Hello Alese, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s… my tummy, really. It’s been bothering me. Quite a bit, actually. It’s a pain… down low. It comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s rather severe. I… believe it has something to do with that… condition the other doctors mentioned? Lupus, was it? It's all a bit foggy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, “tummy pain”...and you suspect it might be related to a previous diagnosis of Lupus. It is common for Lupus to affect the digestive system, but let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. It's good you remember the mention of Lupus, even if the details are a little hazy. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, hazy is a good word for it. My memory… isn’t what it once was. The pain… it’s hard to explain. It's not a constant ache, you see. It comes in waves, almost. A sharp cramping, really. And it feels… deep inside. It's not on the surface, if that makes any sense. It's… a weighty feeling, too, when it's bad. And… sometimes I feel a bit nauseous with it, but I haven't actually been sick. Does that… help? I’m terribly sorry if I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Alese. Don't apologize at all. It's very helpful to hear you describe it that way – “waves,” “sharp cramping,” “deep inside,” “weighty feeling,” and nausea without vomiting. That gives me a much better picture. And when did this start?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a tricky question. When did it start… It’s been… on and off for a while, I think. Months, certainly. But the severe pain… that’s more recent. Perhaps… the last few weeks? It started gradually, just a little discomfort, and then it got progressively worse. It's difficult to pinpoint, really. Everything feels a bit… jumbled up in my mind these days. I wish I could give you a more precise answer. I apologize again.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Alese. It's completely understandable. “On and off for months, with increased severity over the last few weeks.” That’s good information. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Specific triggers… I haven’t noticed anything particular, not that I can recall. I eat pretty much the same things, and I haven’t been doing anything different… or more strenuous, at least. It just… comes. Sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a while, perhaps? Or after eating? But truly, there’s no consistent pattern. I've been trying to pay attention, but it's like… a surprise each time. I really wish I could tell you something concrete, Doctor. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Alese. It's not always easy to pinpoint a trigger. Okay, so no consistent pattern, sometimes after sitting or eating. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… bowel movements. Well… that's a rather personal question, isn’t it? I suppose… they’ve been a bit… irregular. Sometimes constipated, sometimes… not. It varies. And occasionally… a bit of blood, but not a lot. It's usually just a spot, and it hasn't been happening often. It’s a bit alarming, naturally, but I didn’t want to bother you with something so… trivial. I hope that wasn't too much information.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Alese. It’s important information, and you did the right thing telling me. Blood in the stool is never trivial, even if it's just a small amount. It’s good you mentioned that. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Do you remember if you’ve had any other significant illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh dear, my medical history… That’s… a bit of a blur. I do recall being diagnosed with that… autoimmune condition, the lupus, a few years ago. And I’ve had… some problems with my joints, over the years. Arthritis, I think. And I had my appendix out when I was young, of course, but that was… ages ago. I’ve also seen a doctor for high blood pressure, at some point. It's all a bit muddled, I’m afraid. I really wish I had a better record of everything. I apologize for being so vague. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps you have my records from other doctors? That would be very helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Alese. I’m accessing your records now – yes, I see the diagnosis of Lupus, arthritis, and hypertension. That helps tremendously. I also see records from Dr. Elara Vance, your previous physician. Okay, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Let me think… For the blood pressure, I believe I was taking something. A small white pill, I think. But I stopped taking it a while ago. Dr. Vance… she said I could try to manage it with diet and exercise. And for the arthritis… sometimes I take ibuprofen, when my joints are particularly sore. But it's not a regular thing. I haven’t been taking anything specifically for the lupus, just trying to take it easy. That's all I can recall, Doctor. I really hope I’m not forgetting anything important. It's just… so much to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so discontinued medication for hypertension, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and no current medication for Lupus. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don't think so. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I used to get a bit of a rash from poison ivy when I was a child, but that doesn't count, does it? And I'm not particularly fond of shellfish, but that's more of a taste thing. So… no, I don't believe I have any true allergies. Unless… unless something comes back to me later. My memory is so unreliable these days. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alese. It's perfectly alright. So, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's another tricky one. My mother… she had some problems with her heart, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had arthritis, quite severely. But beyond that… I don't really know much about my family’s medical history. My family wasn't one for talking about such things, I suppose. And… I didn’t pay much attention when I was younger. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. I wish I could give you more information.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alese. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about heart problems, diabetes, and arthritis is helpful. Now, finally, a quick question about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. No, no, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve always been a very… sensible person, I suppose. I prefer a good book to… any of that. I hope that’s a satisfactory answer, Doctor. It's all rather personal, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Perfectly satisfactory, Alese. And thank you for being so open with me. Okay, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently examine your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’ll do my best to remain still. It’s just… sometimes my joints are a bit stiff, so… if I wince, please don’t be alarmed. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Alese. We'll take it slow and gentle. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Your heart sounds regular, though slightly rapid. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, but nothing too concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Ouch. There’s some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on your left side. It doesn’t appear to be rigid, but it is definitely sensitive. Do you feel the same pain there when I press?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… exactly where it hurts. It’s a sharp pain, almost. And it radiates a bit, down my left side. It’s not constant, but that pressure… it brings it on. It's… unpleasant, to say the least. Is something… wrong, Doctor? I apologize for being so dramatic. It’s just… it’s a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: You're not being dramatic at all, Alese. It's perfectly natural to be worried when you're experiencing pain. Based on this examination, the tenderness in your lower abdomen, and the pain radiating down your left side, we need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count to check for infection, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a C-reactive protein to look for inflammation. I also want to order a stool test to check for blood and infection, and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at your organs. These tests will help us determine the cause of your pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan. It could be a number of things – diverticulitis, colitis, or even something related to your Lupus. I want to rule everything out to be sure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… extensive. Diverticulitis, colitis… those sound rather serious. And related to my Lupus… well, that’s not particularly reassuring, is it? I suppose… if it’s necessary to rule everything out, then yes, that sounds alright. When will I get the results, Doctor? And… what happens if it is something serious? I apologize for asking so many questions. It’s just… I’m a bit frightened.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Alese. That's what I'm here for. The tests are quite standard, and we'll get the results back within 24 to 48 hours. The lab will contact you directly with the results, and I’ll review them with you as soon as they come in. Regarding what happens if it is something serious… It depends on the diagnosis, of course. Diverticulitis usually requires antibiotics and a liquid diet. Colitis may require medication to reduce inflammation. And if it’s related to your Lupus, we’ll need to adjust your treatment plan accordingly. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, and I’ll explain everything in detail at that time. Here's the number for the lab. And my direct line is 555-123-4567. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever – ibuprofen, 200mg every 4-6 hours as needed. We'll get to the bottom of this, Alese. And I’ll be with you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It's… reassuring to know you're taking this seriously. I suppose… I’ll just try to remain calm and wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. Truly, thank you. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. And you've been a very good patient, asking all the right questions. No, there's nothing else you need to do right now. Just take it easy, stay hydrated, and take the pain reliever if you need it. The lab will contact you to schedule the stool sample collection. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results come in. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Take care, Alese. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
