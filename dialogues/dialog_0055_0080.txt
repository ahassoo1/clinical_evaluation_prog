DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Leidy Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Eaddy. It's nice to meet you too. I'm just here to get some forms filled out, if that's alright. Medicare sent me over and said I needed to get a doctor to sign off on a few things.
DOCTOR: I see. While I am happy to assist with your Medicare paperwork, simply “signing off” on things without a proper consultation wouldn’t be…ethical, or in your best interest. Medicare likely wants assurance that you’ve been evaluated by a physician. To proceed, I will need to ask you a few questions about your health history and current condition. It will be a fairly standard examination, but necessary to fulfill the requirements and ensure there aren't any underlying issues we should address. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, I understand. I didn’t mean just a quick signature. I figured you'd want to ask some questions. Yes, that’s perfectly acceptable. Whatever you need to get the forms done, that’s fine with me. Where should we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin with your primary concern, if you have one. Or, if there isn't a specific issue bringing you in, we can simply go through a general review of your health. Perhaps you could tell me a little about how you’ve been feeling generally these past few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… generally? Well, I feel…okay, I guess. No major complaints. Work’s been steady, which is good. I'm a control and valve installer, so I'm on my feet a lot. Sometimes my back gets a little sore, but that's pretty normal for the job. Other than that, I'd say I'm pretty healthy. I try to eat alright and get enough sleep when I can. Is that the kind of thing you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Fabing. The back soreness is worth noting, given your profession. Could you describe the pain a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: It's not a sharp pain, really. More of a dull ache, you know? It usually starts at the end of the day, after I've been lifting and bending a lot. Sometimes it'll radiate down my legs a little, but it’s not constant. And it usually goes away after I rest for a while. It hasn't been getting worse recently, just…always there if I’ve had a busy day. Nothing I can't handle with some ibuprofen, usually.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this been a recent development, or something you’ve experienced on and off for a long time?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been going on for years, honestly. Since I started doing this kind of work, probably. It flares up sometimes more than others, depending on the job. It was worse when I was younger, I think. Now I just try to be careful and lift with my legs, you know? I've learned to pace myself a bit. It’s just…part of the job, I always figured.
DOCTOR: “Part of the job” is not an acceptable diagnosis, Ms. Fabing. We must rule out any underlying causes for this chronic discomfort. Now, tell me, has this pain ever been accompanied by any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never any numbness or weakness. Just the ache. I’ve never noticed anything else. Sometimes they feel a little tired at the end of the day, but that's probably from being on my feet all day, right? Not like a…tingly or numb feeling, just tired. And it goes away when I sit down and put my feet up. I promise! I'm not trying to brush it off, it's just…not that bad, usually. I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your efforts to minimize the issue, Ms. Fabing, it is my responsibility to perform a thorough evaluation. I'd like to proceed with a brief physical examination. If you would be so kind as to lie down on the examination table, we can begin. It will simply involve checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and range of motion. It will not be unpleasant.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. That sounds good. I understand. I just… I don't like feeling like something's wrong when maybe it isn’t. But I trust you, Doctor. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you could just relax, and let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. I'm going to start by assessing your reflexes in your legs. …Good. And now, I’m going to ask you to flex your ankles and try to point your toes. …Adequate. Now, could you lie flat and tell me if you feel any pain when I lift your leg straight up?
PATIENT: Okay… that's alright. Not too bad. …No, that doesn't hurt. Um… a little. Just a little bit of a stretch in my back, but it’s not painful. Just… noticeable. Is that what you’re looking for? I feel a bit stiff, I guess.
DOCTOR: I see. That stiffness is worth noting. Now, I’m going to palpate your lower back, feeling for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. …Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, right there. That’s a little tender. Not awful, but… yeah, that's it. It feels kinda tight, too. Like a knot or something. Everything else feels okay.
DOCTOR: I see. There is definite tenderness present, and some guarding of the muscles. Alright, Ms. Fabing. That completes the physical examination. Based on your history and what I’ve found during the examination, it appears you have some chronic lower back strain, possibly with some muscle spasm. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I would like to order a few simple laboratory tests: a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. I also recommend a lumbar X-ray to assess your spine.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds…thorough. Lab tests and an X-ray. That seems like a lot for just a sore back, but if you think it’s necessary… alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What do I need to do? How do I get those tests done? And… will those tests tell you for sure what’s going on? I really just want to know if it’s something serious or if it’s just…old age catching up to me, I guess.
DOCTOR: It is always better to be cautious, Ms. Fabing. While it is likely to be a simple musculoskeletal issue, we must rule out any less common, but more serious, causes. The lab tests will help assess your overall health and rule out any inflammatory conditions. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your spine and identify any structural abnormalities. Here is a list of local laboratories where you can have your blood drawn. You will need a lab requisition, which I will provide to you now. For the X-ray, you can schedule an appointment at any imaging center that accepts Medicare. I will also provide you with a referral form. Once you have had the tests done, please bring the results back to me. We can then discuss them and determine the best course of action. It is unlikely to be "old age," Ms. Fabing. More likely, it is a combination of your profession and a lack of proper conditioning. However, we must confirm this with the appropriate testing. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, lab tests and an X-ray. I guess I can do that. It’s just… a lot of appointments. And I'm not really a fan of hospitals, or…imaging centers, or whatever they’re called. Um… just one question. When I’m waiting for the results, is there anything I should be doing? Like, should I be resting more? Or trying to stretch? Or…avoiding lifting things? I don't want to make it worse while I’m waiting for an appointment. I just want to get this sorted out, you know?
DOCTOR: While we await the results, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Continue to lift with proper form, using your legs, but refrain from heavy lifting if possible. Gentle stretching can be beneficial, but avoid any movements that cause pain. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. However, do not exceed the recommended dosage. It is unlikely to worsen significantly while awaiting the results, Ms. Fabing. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as numbness, weakness, or fever, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay, no heavy lifting, gentle stretching, and ibuprofen if I need it. And call if anything gets worse. Alright. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Eaddy. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me, even if it is just a sore back. I'll go schedule the tests and bring the results back as soon as I can. .
