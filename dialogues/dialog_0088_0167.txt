DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. It’s… my foot. It’s been hurting, and there’s a sore that won’t get better. It’s on the bottom, near my toes. A bad sore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on the bottom of your foot that’s not healing. I see. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it started small, I think. Maybe a little cut. But then it got bigger, and now it’s… red. And it hurts when I walk. Not all the time, but mostly. I try not to put too much weight on it. It’s been like this for… a few weeks, maybe a month? I’m not so good with remembering dates these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few weeks to a month, that's helpful. And it’s painful with walking. Is there any discharge coming from the sore – any pus, or is it just red and irritated?
PATIENT: Hmm… discharge? Let me think. It… sometimes looks a little wet. Not a lot, but a little. And sometimes… a little bit of white stuff. Is that the pus you mean? I don’t know all the fancy words, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wetness with some white stuff. That does sound like pus. And is the redness spreading, or has it stayed about the same size?
PATIENT: It feels… a little bigger. Hard to tell for sure, but I think it’s spreading a little bit around the edges. Not much, but I noticed it this morning when I put on my slippers. It’s also… warm to the touch, if that makes sense. My wife used to say it felt warm, but… she’s gone now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Stoegbauer. It's understandable to have those thoughts come up. Okay, so the redness is spreading slightly, and it's warm to the touch. Do you have any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. I feel… normal, except for the foot. A little tired, maybe, but I’m old, so that’s not unusual. Just the foot is bothering me. It keeps me up a little at night sometimes, because of the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to treat it yourself – any creams, bandages, soaking it, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, I tried some cream. The kind you put on cuts. And I put a bandage on it, but it keeps getting… wet. And I tried soaking it in warm water, like my wife used to tell me, but it didn’t seem to help much. Maybe made it a little worse. I’m not sure. It’s just… stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your sock and shoe for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just a minute. Here you go. It doesn't look very pretty, does it? It's right here, on the ball of my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore. It is red and inflamed, and there is some drainage present. It does appear to be spreading, as you mentioned. The skin around it is also warm to the touch. There’s no noticeable odor at this time. It looks deeper than just a simple cut. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. I can feel everything. It just… hurts. Especially when I put weight on it. And it feels… sensitive, even when I don’t touch it. Like it’s going to… burst, maybe? Is that a silly thing to say?
DOCTOR: No, that's not silly at all. It sounds concerning. Given the redness, drainage, warmth, and the fact that it’s not healing, it’s possible this is an infection. It could also be something else, but an infection is what I'm most worried about right now. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or any problems with circulation in your legs?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I have diabetes. The doctor told me a long time ago. I try to watch my sugar, but it’s not always easy. And… sometimes my legs feel a little… heavy. Not all the time, but sometimes. Especially when it’s warm. I haven’t been very good about checking my feet lately, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. Diabetes can make infections harder to heal, and it’s important to be extra careful with your feet. The heaviness in your legs could indicate some circulation issues as well. I’m going to order some lab work to check for an infection and to see how your blood sugar is doing. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to make sure there’s no underlying bone infection. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to get better. It’s hard to get around when my foot hurts. The X-ray and the lab work… yes, please. Will that take long? I have… a little appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab work should take about 15-20 minutes. The X-ray will be quick, maybe 5 minutes. We can likely get both done before your afternoon appointment. While we're waiting, I’m going to clean the wound gently and apply a sterile dressing. I will also want to check your pulses in your feet to assess circulation. I want to be upfront with you – given your diabetes and the appearance of the sore, we may need to consider antibiotics. We’ll wait for the lab results to confirm, but it's something we should prepare for. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. If antibiotics will help, then that’s good. I trust your judgment. Cleaning the wound and checking my pulses… yes, please do. I’m ready whenever you are. Thank you for taking such good care of me. It makes me feel… better just talking to you.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get started. I’m going to gently clean the wound with a sterile saline solution. This might sting a little, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. The wound is approximately 2cm in diameter, located on the plantar aspect of the forefoot. There is purulent drainage and surrounding erythema. I'm palpating your pulses now… good strong pulses on both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. Capillary refill is less than 3 seconds in your toes. Now, I’ll apply a sterile dressing to keep it clean. After the lab work and X-ray, a technician will come in to take some blood. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with any medicine before. That feels… nice and clean, thank you. I appreciate you being so careful. Are you sure it doesn’t look too bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you don't have any allergies. And it's okay to be worried, Mr. Stoegbauer. It is concerning, and that's why we're taking these steps to find out what's going on. The redness and drainage are what concern me most, especially with your diabetes. We'll get the lab work and X-ray done, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. While we wait for the results, please try to stay off your foot as much as possible, and keep the dressing clean and dry. I'm going to have the technician come in and draw your blood now. It will just be a quick finger prick for a glucose level and a blood draw to check for infection. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready, Doctor. Finger prick and blood draw… just let me know if it’s going to hurt. I can handle a little pain. I’ve lived a long life, you know. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel… less scared.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. You’ve been very brave and cooperative. I'll let the technician know you're ready. It will just be a small pinch, and it will be over before you know it. I'll be back in a few minutes once the lab work is sent off and we can discuss next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any increased pain, fever, chills, or notice any spreading redness, please let the nursing staff know immediately.
