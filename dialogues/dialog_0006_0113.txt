DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Well, it’s… the bathroom. I keep having to go. Seems like all I do is… well, you know. More than usual, that’s for sure. It's a nuisance, really. Old age, I suppose. Everything goes with old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent urination. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It feels like… a while. Maybe a couple of months? Or was it longer? Time just… slips away, you know? I haven’t been keeping track of bathroom trips, I can tell you that much. My wife, bless her heart, she might know better. She notices these things.
DOCTOR: A couple of months. Alright. And is it just more frequent, or are you feeling a sudden, strong urge to go, even when you don't necessarily need to?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… sometimes it feels like I need to go, but when I get there… not much happens. Just a little dribble. Annoying, that is. Wastes my time, really. I've got things to do, you know? The garden isn't going to weed itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and a sense of urgency, even with incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. It’s not painful. More like… a little uncomfortable. A little straining, maybe. You know, just getting things going. Like a rusty pipe, I suppose. Old age again. Everything slows down, everything gets… rusty.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any blood in your urine at all?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness no. I would notice blood. My wife would definitely notice blood. No, no blood. Definitely not. That would be… serious. I haven’t seen anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any conditions I should be aware of – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high. Put me on a pill for it. I think. Or maybe it was my cholesterol. Honestly, it was a long time ago, and I take a few pills every day, I can't remember which one was for what anymore. My wife handles all that. She’s very organized, that woman. She keeps everything straight. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can go over your medications in a bit. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. Penicillin, I think? Or was that my father? No, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty tough, you know? Ukrainian stock. We're a hardy people.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. My appendix. When I was a young man. A long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia repaired, but that was so long ago, I barely remember it. It didn't bother me much. Nothing else comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just going to listen to your abdomen and check a few things. Then we can talk about what might be going on. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well, alright. I suppose so. Just don't poke around too much, eh? Old bones, you know. A little fragile these days. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have tomatoes to harvest later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just a quick listen and feel. Nothing too strenuous, I promise. First, let me listen to your abdomen. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Getting old is no fun, let me tell you. grunts There we go. Just be gentle, doctor. Gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’m listening now… and just feeling your abdomen. Everything seems… fairly normal. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness or masses. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, which is common at your age, but nothing overly concerning at this stage. Do you experience any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Discomfort? Hmm. A little bit, maybe. Right there. Not pain, exactly. More like… pressure. Like someone’s sitting on my bladder. But it comes and goes. It’s probably nothing. Like I said, old age. Everything feels a little… pressurized these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. I think what we're experiencing is likely benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It's a common condition in men your age where the prostate gland enlarges, which can cause urinary frequency, urgency, and incomplete emptying. Your symptoms certainly align with that. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a PSA test to get a baseline reading of your prostate-specific antigen. That will give us a more complete picture. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… PSA test… Oh, goodness. More tests. You know, I hate going to the doctor. It’s all tests and poking and prodding. But, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please don’t make me come back too many times. I have things to do, you know? The garden…
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. We'll try to keep it as simple as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn't take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss potential treatment options. In the meantime, I recommend you try to avoid excessive fluid intake before bed, and you could try double voiding – that’s trying to urinate again a few minutes after you think you're finished. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Double voiding? You mean… go to the bathroom, and then go again a little while later? Sounds… inconvenient. But alright, I’ll try it. I suppose it’s better than running back and forth all night. And less fluid before bed… yes. I drink a lot of tea, you know. Maybe I’ll switch to water. Is there anything else? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, you can go now. The lab technician will explain the process when you get there. They’ll need a urine sample and a small blood sample. I’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available – should be within a few days. And if you experience any fever, chills, or significant pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Fever, chills… No, no. I don't get fevers. I’m a tough Ukrainian. I think I'll be alright. No, no questions. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results, eh? And thank you, doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. .
