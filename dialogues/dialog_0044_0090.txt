DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Asami. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Um... well, I’m here for… a check-up, I believe? Before a surgery. It’s… cosmetic. Honestly, my memory isn’t the best these days, so I don't recall all the specifics. It has something to do with… wanting to feel a bit more like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-operative check-up for a cosmetic surgery. That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s very common for patients to feel a little foggy on details, especially with something they’re doing for themselves. No worries at all. To help me get a better picture of things, could you tell me what type of surgery you’re planning to have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, this is what I mean about my memory… I really wish I could be more help. I think it has to do with my face… something about restoring some… volume? Or maybe smoothing things out? It was a long conversation with the surgeon, and… well, things have been a bit difficult since my husband passed, so it’s hard to keep track of everything. I apologize. Is there a way you can access the information from the surgeon’s office?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. It's perfectly understandable. Grief can absolutely affect memory and focus, and you shouldn’t apologize at all. It’s much more important to focus on you right now. Yes, I can access your records from the surgeon’s office. Let me just pull that up here… Ah, yes. I see here you’re scheduled for a facial fat grafting and mild skin tightening procedure with Dr. Ramirez. That explains the volume and smoothing aspects. It looks like he wants to get a baseline assessment of your overall health before proceeding. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes! That sounds exactly right. Dr. Ramirez… yes, he was very kind. Facial fat grafting… that’s it. It’s… it's a little embarrassing to admit, but I just want to look a bit more… refreshed, I suppose. It’s been a long year. And yes, a baseline assessment makes perfect sense. Are there things I need to do for this assessment? Blood work, perhaps? I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly valid to want to feel good about yourself, and wanting a refresh is a wonderful goal. And yes, a baseline assessment is standard procedure. We'll start with some routine blood work to check your overall health – things like your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and blood sugar. We’ll also want to get a current blood pressure and heart rate reading, and I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Just a standard check to make sure you’re a good candidate for surgery. Before we get to the physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… let me think. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses. I had… the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, rubella, but that was a long time ago. I do have… a slight sensitivity to penicillin, causes a rash. And I had my tonsils removed when I was a teenager. Other than that… Oh! I do take a daily multivitamin. And… I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but it cleared up with antibiotics. Is that helpful? I worry I’m forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mackenzi, thank you. No need to worry, you’re doing great. Penicillin sensitivity is important to know, and we’ll make sure your chart is clearly marked. Tonsils removed and a history of bronchitis are good to have as well. And the daily multivitamin is good information. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries besides your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… No, I don't believe so. Nothing else. I did have… a rather nasty fall a few years ago, fractured my wrist, but it was treated with a cast and healed well. No surgery needed for that, thankfully. Just a lot of physical therapy. Is that what you mean by surgery? Anything more invasive than a cast? I honestly don’t recall anything else. It’s… frustrating, this memory. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. A fractured wrist treated with a cast doesn’t count as a surgery, so that’s perfectly fine. It's good you remember the physical therapy, though – that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or any autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a bit tricky. My mother’s side… my grandmother had heart trouble, I believe. And my uncle had diabetes. My father’s side… I’m not as close to that side of the family, so I don’t know as much. He had some… lung issues, I think, but I don’t know the specifics. He smoked for many years. My mother was generally healthy, thankfully. She lived to be eighty-five. Does that help? I wish I could be more precise. It feels like I’m grasping at straws sometimes. I truly apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mackenzi. It’s common for family histories to be a bit hazy, especially if you’re not closely connected to that side of the family. Knowing about the heart trouble and diabetes, and the lung issues with your father, is helpful enough. We can always revisit this later if you remember anything else. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs. I’m a very… moderate person, I suppose. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book, honestly. I do enjoy gardening, which keeps me quite active. Is that helpful? I try to stay as healthy as possible. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mackenzi. A quiet life, enjoying gardening and books – that sounds very peaceful and healthy. It's good to hear. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to a quick physical exam. How would you describe your overall stress level?
PATIENT: Stress… that’s a… complicated question, Doctor. Honestly, it’s been quite high, particularly since my husband passed away. It’s… difficult adjusting to life without him. I try to manage it with gardening and spending time with friends, but… it’s always there, lurking in the background. I wouldn’t say it’s debilitating, but it’s definitely a factor. It’s… a lot. I apologize for being so… open. It’s just… sometimes it’s hard to keep everything bottled up.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly natural to be grieving, and it's very brave of you to be open about it. It’s important to acknowledge those feelings. In fact, I’m glad you shared that with me. It helps me to understand you better and provide the best possible care. Now, before we move onto the physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, besides the daily multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the multivitamin. I haven’t needed anything else. I did take some… painkillers briefly after the wrist fracture, but that was years ago, and I’ve been off of them since. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. Just the multivitamin, and I truly believe in a healthy diet, so I try to get most of my nutrients that way. Is there anything else you need to know before we start the exam? I’m ready when you are. Although, perhaps you could explain what the exam will involve? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mackenzi. Just the multivitamin – good to know. And that’s very sensible about focusing on a healthy diet. And absolutely, I can explain the exam. It will be fairly standard – I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, take a look at your throat and ears, and palpate your lymph nodes. I’ll also take a look at your skin, just to get a baseline assessment. It shouldn’t take long, and it won’t be uncomfortable. I’ll just need you to sit on the exam table and relax. Would you like me to explain anything else before we begin?
PATIENT: No, that sounds perfectly fine. I think I understand. Just a standard check-up, as you said. I’m ready when you are. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel much more comfortable.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It’s my pleasure. Alright, let’s get started. Okay, your heart rate is a little elevated, at 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to a number of things – stress, anxiety, or even just talking. The rhythm is regular, which is good. No murmurs or extra sounds detected. And your lungs are clear – no wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds detected. Nice and clear breathing. Blood pressure is 135/85. A little on the higher side, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. And your ears are also clear. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness detected. Skin appears normal – no rashes, lesions, or other abnormalities detected. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated and your heart rate is a little fast, likely due to stress. Do you have any questions about those findings?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't sound too concerning. I’m not surprised about the heart rate and blood pressure, given everything that’s been going on. I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It’s reassuring to hear everything is… normal, despite everything. So, what happens next? Do you need any further tests before I can proceed with the surgery? Or is this enough to get the green light? I’m eager to get this done, but I want to make sure I’m being responsible and taking all the necessary steps.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Mackenzi, and I appreciate your proactive approach. Given your history and the unremarkable physical exam, I don’t think extensive further testing is immediately necessary. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and a complete blood count to get a more detailed look at your overall health. These are standard pre-operative tests. I also recommend you follow up with your primary care physician to discuss your blood pressure. They may want to monitor it more closely. Assuming those tests come back within normal limits, I don't see any reason why you couldn't proceed with the surgery. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A BMP and CBC… I can definitely do that. And following up with my primary care physician about my blood pressure is a good idea – I’ve been meaning to schedule an appointment anyway. So, how do I go about getting those tests done? Do you have a lab you recommend? And how long do you think it will take to get the results back? I’m eager to move forward, but I understand these things take time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you agree. We can actually do the blood work right here in the clinic, in our on-site lab. I’ll write you a requisition form, and the phlebotomist will draw your blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. The results typically come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll review them and contact you to discuss them and give you the green light for surgery, assuming everything looks good. I’ll also send a copy of the results to your primary care physician for their records. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… incredibly convenient, actually. Doing it right here in the clinic is perfect. 24-48 hours is perfectly acceptable. And sending a copy to my primary care physician is thoughtful. I think I have all my questions answered, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient and thorough with me. I truly appreciate it. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It's my pleasure. I understand it can be stressful preparing for surgery, and I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Let me get the phlebotomist to come in and draw your blood. “Could someone please come to exam room three for a blood draw?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: "Hi Mackenzi, Dr. Asami said you're here for some routine bloodwork. I'll just need to verify your name and date of birth. It will only take a few minutes." Alright, all done! The lab will send the results to Dr. Asami within 24-48 hours. Just relax and let us handle it from here. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for being so gentle – I’m not a fan of needles, and you made it as painless as possible. I believe Dr. Asami has everything he needs from me now. I truly appreciate both of your kindness and patience today. I’m feeling much more confident about moving forward with the surgery.
DOCTOR: "You're very welcome! We try our best to make it as comfortable as possible. If you feel any lingering discomfort, please don't hesitate to let us know." "Excellent. Well, that concludes our visit today, Mackenzi. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the lab results. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office." "I wish you all the best with your surgery. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way." "Have a wonderful day, Mackenzi!"
PATIENT: Thank you both so much. I truly appreciate your kindness and support. Have a wonderful day as well.
