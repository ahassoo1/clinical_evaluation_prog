DOCTOR: Right. Well, Courtnye, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor… Muretic, right? Yeah, it’s my bruising. It’s been…worse lately. I'm on blood thinners, and I just keep getting these big bruises for no reason. It's kinda scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Muretic, yes. And please, call me Milan. “Doctor Muretic” makes me feel ancient. Okay, bruising that's worsening, especially while on blood thinners… that is concerning, you’re right to be worried. Let’s get some details. First, how long have you been noticing this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe… six weeks ago? But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last two weeks. Like, I bumped my arm on the table a couple of days ago and got a bruise the size of my hand. Normally, it wouldn't be like that.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, and rapidly worsening… alright. And you said a bump on the arm caused a large bruise… any other injuries causing similar bruising, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, little knocks here and there, normal stuff, but nothing that would usually cause a bruise like this. I also noticed a couple on my legs, and I haven’t even done anything to my legs. It's just… appearing.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising with minimal trauma, and spontaneous bruising on your legs… This is definitely something we need to investigate further. Do you have any bleeding elsewhere?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Like… nosebleeds? No, not really. My gums sometimes bleed a little when I brush, but that’s always happened. Nothing new there. Oh! And maybe a couple of more easily broken blood vessels in my eyes, but I figured that was just from… straining. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of gum bleeding, and possibly some broken vessels in your eyes… those could be related. Straining can cause that, but we need to consider everything. Now, let's talk about the blood thinner you're on. What medication are you taking, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: It's… Warfarin. I take 5 milligrams every evening. Doctor Patel prescribed it about a year and a half ago, after I had a blood clot in my leg. It was a bad one. I’ve been pretty regular with it, but… honestly, I haven’t always been the best at keeping track of my INR results.
DOCTOR: Right, Warfarin 5mg daily for a history of DVT... And irregular INR monitoring. That’s…suboptimal, to put it mildly. We absolutely need to get that under control. It’s very important to have regular blood tests when you’re on Warfarin. Before we dive into the INR, let's get a more complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but it’s been fine for a few years now, doctor – Milan, sorry, I’m still getting used to it! I also had my gallbladder removed a long time ago, but that’s it. Nothing major, I promise.
DOCTOR: No, that's good to know. High blood pressure managed, cholecystectomy… Okay. And are you taking any other medications besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just some vitamins, really. Vitamin D, because the doctor said my levels were low. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D supplementation and occasional ibuprofen. Good. Now, family history… has anyone in your family had significant bleeding issues, or a lot of bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, my grandmother, on my mum’s side, she bruised really easily. Everyone always said it was just because she was old, but… yeah, she did. She never really went to the doctor much, though. And my uncle, he had a blood clot once, a long time ago. But that’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. A family history of easy bruising and a prior clot...Okay, one last bit of history before we get to a physical exam. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, but didn't like it. I do drink sometimes, a glass of wine with dinner maybe two or three times a week. Nothing crazy. And I don’t do any drugs, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, moderate alcohol consumption, no drug use… That's helpful. Right. Courtnye, this is all very important information. Given your increased bruising, Warfarin use, and irregular monitoring, we need to investigate further. I want to do a physical exam, and then I’m going to order some blood tests. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor – Milan. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I'm getting a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. And we will. Okay. If you could just sit up here for me, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin, particularly where you’ve been bruising. And I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. It's just a routine check, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is normal. As you said, you do have significant bruising on both arms and legs. I’m also palpating your abdomen now… it’s soft, no tenderness. No enlarged organs or masses. “Skin: Significant bruising on bilateral extremities, varying stages of healing. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no organomegaly.” Now, I’m going to need to draw some blood for a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to assess your INR, and some basic metabolic panels. This will give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Is there anything I need to do before the blood test? Like, should I avoid anything?
DOCTOR: That's good of you to ask. Yes, actually. Since you’re on Warfarin, it's best to avoid any strenuous activity for a few hours after the blood draw, just in case of prolonged bleeding. And please, continue to take your Warfarin as prescribed. Do not adjust your dosage without talking to me first. Also, if you have any new bleeding or bruising, let me know immediately. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take good care of you. Once we have those results, we can discuss a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. I just… I'm a little nervous, I guess. It’s just that I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Courtnye. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We’re going to take this one step at a time. The blood tests will give us the information we need to figure out what’s going on. I don't think it’s anything to panic about yet, but it definitely needs to be investigated. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. And I'll be reviewing the results as soon as they come in. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any mobility issues or any fears of needles?
