DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been… forgetting things. Not huge things, usually, but enough that it's starting to worry me. Like, I’ll walk into a room and completely forget why I went in there. Or I can’t always remember what I had for breakfast. Little things, but... frequent.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned about memory changes, and you’re doing the right thing by getting it checked out. It’s much better to address these things early. And don’t feel embarrassed at all – memory lapses are quite common. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about when these memory problems started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, because it was so gradual. But I think… maybe six months ago? It felt like things just slowly started getting a little… fuzzier. I definitely noticed it more around the holidays, trying to remember what I’d gotten people for gifts, things like that. Before that, it wasn’t so bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual onset is very common. Six months ago is helpful information. And are these memory issues consistent, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They definitely come and go. Some days are much worse than others. Like, yesterday I was fine, I think. But last week I completely forgot a dentist appointment. And a few times I’ve felt… confused, almost, like I was in a fog for a little while. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes, but it's unsettling. It’s not every day, though. Some days I feel perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent, with periods of feeling “normal” and periods of increased forgetfulness and some brief periods of confusion. That’s helpful. Now, when you say confused, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not like I don’t know who I am, or where I am. It’s more like… everything feels a little distant? Like I’m watching a movie of my life instead of living it. And it’s hard to think clearly. I know I need to do something, or remember something, but I just… can’t quite grasp it. It's very brief, like I said, maybe five minutes at most. It's just… weird. And a little scary, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be unsettling, Ms. Heidenthal, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. It's good that you're able to articulate what you’re experiencing. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a brief review of your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… actually, yes. Now that you mention it, I haven’t been sleeping very well. I wake up a lot during the night, and sometimes I just lie awake for hours. I thought it was just stress, but… maybe it’s related? I don't know. I used to be a really sound sleeper. It’s been going on for a few months, I think, around the same time I started noticing the memory problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, disturbed sleep, coinciding with the onset of memory issues. That is certainly something we need to consider. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the memory loss and sleep disturbances?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a little more clumsy lately. I tripped over the rug the other day, which I never do. And I’ve had a few headaches, but nothing terrible. Just sort of… dull aches. Oh, and I think I’ve been a bit more irritable, snapping at people when I normally wouldn’t. My neighbor commented on it actually. I felt bad. Is that… too much information? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Heidenthal. That’s all very helpful information, and you’re not rambling. Increased clumsiness, headaches, and irritability, in addition to the memory loss and sleep disturbances – it’s all pieces of the puzzle. To complete the picture, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um, not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a while now. And I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, but that was years ago and hasn’t caused any problems. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well and get some exercise. I walk my dog every day. Does the blood pressure medication matter? I take Lisinopril, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Yes, the Lisinopril is helpful information. We will need to consider that as a possible contributing factor. And have you ever had any problems with depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I wouldn't say I've had problems, exactly. But after my mother passed away a few years ago, I was definitely feeling down for a while. It was really hard. I didn’t go to a doctor or take any medication, I just… got through it. And I’ve been fine since then, really. But I do get stressed sometimes, like anyone. I just haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly clear, Ms. Heidenthal. It's helpful to know about your experience after your mother's passing, even without a formal diagnosis. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! I take a multivitamin every day, just a standard one. And sometimes, when my joints are achy, I’ll take some ibuprofen. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I don't really believe in a lot of those supplements, honestly. Just the multivitamin for good measure. And ibuprofen when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve had a few mosquito bites, of course, but nothing serious. No medication allergies, no food allergies, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, one final question regarding your medical history: Can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tough one. My mother had dementia, but it wasn’t diagnosed until she was quite old, maybe in her eighties. And my father had high blood pressure, like me. My grandmother on my mother’s side had some kind of arthritis, I think. Other than that, I don't really know much about my family's medical history. Nobody really talked about it. I wish I knew more. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very useful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Heidenthal. Your mother's history of dementia is particularly relevant, and your father's high blood pressure adds to the picture. It's not your fault you don't have more information. Many families don’t discuss medical history, and it’s common to have gaps. Now, to get a clearer understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your vital signs, do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m a little nervous, but I want to figure out what’s going on. So, yes, please. Let's do the exam. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your trust, Ms. Heidenthal. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 138/82, your pulse is 72 and regular, your respiration rate is 16 and unlabored, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That's all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Your lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Next, I will perform a brief neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It's a little strange, but yes, I can do it. No problem. I used to be really good at eye exercises when I was younger. Is this… normal? I feel a little silly just looking at your finger.
DOCTOR: That’s good. It's a good sign that you can track my finger smoothly. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. You’re able to touch your nose with your finger accurately, and your heel-to-shin test is also within normal limits, although a little unsteady. Your gait is slightly wider than usual, and you appear a little unsteady on your feet, but nothing alarming. Based on the physical exam and your medical history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The memory loss, sleep disturbances, irritability, and slight unsteadiness could be due to a number of factors, including stress, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or early cognitive impairment. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay. That… sounds like a lot. But yes, if that's what you think is best, then yes, I'm comfortable with that. Blood tests and an MRI. I just… I want to know what's going on. The not knowing is the worst part, I think. When can I have the blood tests done? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a book club meeting next Thursday, and I really don’t want to miss it. Is that silly? I’m trying not to let this take over my life.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s not silly at all to want to maintain your routine. The not knowing is definitely the hardest part, and we will get you answers as quickly as possible. The blood tests can be done at the lab just down the hall, and they usually take about 30 minutes. The results typically come back within 3-5 business days. We will call you as soon as we have them. The MRI will take a little longer to schedule, as we need to find an open slot at the imaging center. It will likely be within the next week or two. We’ll call you to schedule that as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Try to reduce stress as much as possible, and continue to engage in activities you enjoy, like your book club. Is there anything I can prescribe in the meantime to help with your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good. I’m glad you said something about trying to reduce stress. It's just… everything feels a little overwhelming right now. And yes, maybe something for sleep would be good. I've tried chamomile tea, but it doesn’t really seem to help. I don't want anything too strong, though. I have to drive, and I don’t want to feel groggy. And I’m not sure I want to depend on medication if I can avoid it. What are my options?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Heidenthal. It's wise to be cautious about medication, especially when driving. For sleep, we can start with a very low dose of Trazodone, a medication sometimes used for sleep. It's generally well-tolerated and has a relatively low side effect profile. We would start with 25mg at bedtime. It doesn't cause the same grogginess as some other sleep aids, but it's important to see how you react to it. Alternatively, we could try Melatonin, a natural hormone that helps regulate sleep. However, it's not always effective for everyone. I also recommend practicing good sleep hygiene. That includes going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed, and making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool. Would you prefer to try the Trazodone or the Melatonin?
PATIENT: Hmm. You know what? I think I'd prefer to try the Melatonin first. If that doesn't work, then maybe the Trazodone. I’m just a little hesitant about starting a new medication right away. The Melatonin sounds more gentle. And I will definitely try to work on the sleep hygiene. I probably stay up too late scrolling through my phone. I need to be better about that. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Heidenthal. Starting with Melatonin is a very reasonable approach. We’ll start with 3mg at bedtime, and you can increase to 5mg if needed. Here is the prescription. To summarize, we've ordered blood tests and an MRI to investigate your memory loss. We’ve prescribed Melatonin for sleep, and I encourage you to focus on good sleep hygiene. We will call you as soon as we have the results of the tests, and we can discuss them further at that time. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, and you've answered all my questions. I really appreciate your patience and understanding. It's a little scary going through all this, but I feel much better knowing I’m in good hands. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka. I'll see you when the test results are back. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I understand your apprehension, and I am here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and try to get some rest.
