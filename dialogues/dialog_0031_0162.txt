DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chit-chat, Doc. Just… my stomach's been puffed up. Feels like I'm gonna blow like a balloon, alright? It's been going on for a bit now. Honestly, it's probably nothing, but my wife—well, she's not here anymore—and she always told me to get these things checked out. So here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate you coming in, and it’s good of you to prioritize your health, especially considering your wife’s concerns. “Puffed up” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about when this started, and if anything specifically seems to make it worse or better?
PATIENT: Ugh, when did it start? Honestly, I don't keep track of that stuff. A while ago, I guess. Maybe a few weeks? A month? It's just… there. And nothing really makes it better. Eating makes it worse, obviously, but so does not eating, if that makes any sense. It's just… always there. I eat, it gets bigger. I don't eat, it's still big. It's annoying, alright? Is that helpful? I don't know why you need all these details.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Kristofik, thank you. It sounds quite frustrating to have something persistent like that. The fact that it doesn’t seem to be reliably affected by eating is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe what you mean by "big"?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, are you gonna poke me or what? Because I really don’t have time for a full examination right now. "Big" means… like I swallowed a basketball, alright? My pants feel tight. I look pregnant, honestly. It's not exactly subtle. Is that specific enough? I’m a pile driver operator, I don’t spend my days measuring my stomach. It’s just… swollen. And uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Kristofik, and I assure you, we’ll be as efficient as possible. A physical exam will be necessary to properly assess what’s going on, but we can certainly focus on the areas most relevant to your concerns. Before we do that, let's get a bit more history. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Jeez. Like what? I dunno. I haven't exactly been cataloging everything that happens to my body. I guess… sometimes I feel a little gassy. And tired. But who isn't tired? I work hard, alright? Pile driving isn’t a desk job. Is feeling a little bloated and tired unusual? Look, I'm starting to think this is a waste of my time. Is this gonna lead to anything or are we just gonna keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Kristofik. No, feeling bloated and tired isn't necessarily unusual, but it's important to consider all possibilities when something is persistent. We’re trying to gather enough information to determine the best course of action. Let’s briefly touch on your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. Nothing major. I had… appendicitis when I was a kid, I think. And a broken arm once, falling off a roof. But that was ages ago. Honestly, I don't go to doctors. Never have. My wife used to make me go for checkups, but… well. So, no. Not really. I'm generally a healthy guy. I work hard, eat what I can, and try to stay out of trouble. Is that good enough? Or do you need a list of every cold I ever had?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Kristofik. No, a list of every cold isn’t necessary. Just wanted to rule out any pre-existing conditions. And it's good to hear you generally consider yourself healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Seriously? Look, I’m a pile driver, not a yoga instructor. No, I don’t take any supplements. And I try to avoid pills as much as possible. I took some… antacids a few times when the stomach was really bothering me, but that's it. Over the counter. The regular kind. Nothing fancy. Honestly, I just figured it was something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away, so… here I am. And frankly, I'm losing patience. Can we just… do something? A test? A scan? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. I assure you, we're working towards a solution. A physical exam is the next logical step, and then we can discuss potential testing if needed. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Ugh. Look, I've lived a long life. I've probably been exposed to everything. I don't know of any major allergies. Maybe a little itchy when mosquitoes bite me, but that’s it. No food allergies, no drug allergies, nothing like that. I don't spend my time looking for things to be allergic to, alright? Can we please get on with it? I have work to do. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. No known allergies – that’s good. Let’s proceed with a physical exam, then. If you don’t mind, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate – feel – your abdomen to assess the size and tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable during the examination. If you could lie back on the table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick, alright? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And don’t expect me to tell you everything if it feels weird. I’m a tough guy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. I’ll be as efficient and gentle as possible. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Take some deep breaths for me. Alright. I’m noticing some distention – that’s the swelling you’ve described. It’s fairly uniform across the abdomen. There's some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Okay. Based on the exam, the distention and tenderness warrant further investigation. It could be a number of things, from a simple accumulation of gas to something more significant. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal X-ray. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Look, are we looking for a baby in there or what? Fine, whatever. Just… get it over with. Blood tests, X-rays… just tell me what I need to do and where. I don’t have all day. And I'm not paying for anything fancy. I have insurance, but… I don’t want any surprises. Alright? Just get it done. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Kristofik. The X-ray is simply to rule out any obvious obstructions or free air in the abdomen. It’s a standard procedure. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. We’ll submit everything to your insurance, and we can certainly discuss any potential costs beforehand if needed. Okay, I'm sending the orders to the lab and radiology department now. The lab is just down the hall to your left, room 203. They will draw some blood. After that, radiology is on the third floor, room 312. They will take the X-ray. You don’t need an appointment for either one. Just let them know you’re here for Dr. Rakosky’s orders. Once those are completed, please come back, and we'll discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… tell me how long this is gonna take. I have a schedule, you know? I can't just sit around all day waiting for blood tests and X-rays. And make sure they don't poke me too much. Honestly, I'm starting to regret even coming here. This is a whole lot of fuss over a little bloating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. The blood draw should take approximately 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray another 10-15 minutes. After that, the results will be sent to me. I anticipate having them back within a couple of hours, and I will have my assistant contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I assure you, we are trying to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. And I'll make a note to let the technicians know to be as gentle as possible during the procedures. Thank you for your patience. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions before you leave.
