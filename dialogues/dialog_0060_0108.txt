DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleedin’. Not a pretty sight, I tell ya. Happened a couple times now. Thought I’d get it checked before I ended up… well, you know. It’s not like I have a lot of time to waste with this stuff.
DOCTOR: “Bleeding,” you say. Alright. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, lemme think. It started… maybe a week ago? Hard to say for sure. I don’t keep a calendar for… that. First time, I figured it was somethin’ I ate. Bad kebab, maybe. But then it happened again last night, and… well, that’s two times too many. It's not just a little, either. It’s… substantial. You understand what I mean. Substantial.
DOCTOR: “Substantial,” right. And can you describe what it looks like?
PATIENT: Ugh, do I have to? Look, it’s blood, alright? Red blood. Darker sometimes, like… like old coffee grounds. And there’s… bits in it. I don't wanna get into details, lady. It's unpleasant. Definitely not somethin’ you wanna see in your toilet bowl, let me tell ya. It’s enough to ruin a man's appetite, and I like my food.
DOCTOR: Right, dark, coffee-ground-like blood. That's… helpful. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I'm tired, okay? I'm always tired. That's just… bein’ my age, I guess. And a little weak, maybe. But I work with… well, you know what I work with. It takes it outta ya. Other than that… no. No stomach pain, no nothin'. Just… bleedin’ and bein' tired. It’s probably just somethin’ I ate, honestly. Probably just need a stronger antacid or somethin'.
DOCTOR: “Just something you ate” is what a lot of people say. But repeated bleeding isn’t usually just something you ate. Let's go through some more questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm. Not that I recall. I’ve had the usual aches and pains, you know, back trouble from the job, but nothin’ a good massage couldn’t fix. My wife… she took care of all the doctor stuff. She knew all that… paperwork and medical terms. It’s been a few years since she passed, and frankly, I haven’t bothered keeping up with it. It’s a waste of time, most of it. Honestly, lady, I’m a practical man. I don’t need a list of ailments. I just need to stop bleedin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Not much left. Got a brother, somewhere in Yemen, I think. Haven't spoken to him in years. He... he always was a bit of a dreamer, not practical like me. And a couple of distant cousins, but we barely know each other. Never any history of stomach troubles, if that’s what you’re askin’. They were all strong, hardy folks. Used to working the land, you know. Not sitting around worrying about their insides.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never been much for pills. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. My wife used to try and get me to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but I told her I felt fine. And I felt fine. Still do, mostly. I just need to get this bleedin’ stopped. It’s… demoralizing. You wouldn’t understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Gentz, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. We’ll start with checking your vital signs and then I'll listen to your abdomen and do a quick rectal exam to get a better sense of what's going on. It’s not pleasant, but it’s necessary. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah, not really. I can handle a little dust, a little heat. Maybe a bit sensitive to strong perfumes, but that’s about it. A rectal exam, though? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we just... order some tests? Or something? I don’t much care for people poking around down there, if you catch my drift. It just feels… invasive. And frankly, a little undignified. I'm not a young man anymore, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with repeated bleeding and the description you’ve given, a physical exam is absolutely necessary to determine the source of the problem and rule out serious causes. It's a standard part of the evaluation process, and it’s the responsible thing to do. I understand your discomfort, but it’s for your own well-being. Are you certain you don’t have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Do what you gotta do, I suppose. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And no, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Latex, rubber, whatever. Never had a problem. Just… get it over with, alright? I have things to do. And I'd appreciate it if you could be quick about it. Honestly, this is a waste of my time, but if it gets me back to normal, I’ll put up with it. But quick, alright? Quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with your vital signs. And I will be as efficient as possible.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try not to poke too much. And maybe put some paper down? I don’t need to see what other folks have been… leaving behind. Honestly, the indignity of it all. This whole thing is ridiculous. But alright, let’s get it over with. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie on your back with your knees bent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Heart rate is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. Now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. Just… be gentle. And don't poke too hard. This is all very uncomfortable. I feel a little pressure, but no real pain. Just… a general discomfort. It's always a bit tender, you know, with all the… work I do. It's not unusual. But don't force anything. Honestly, I'm not enjoying this one bit. It’s… demeaning.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, I am going to need to perform a rectal exam to assess for any signs of bleeding or abnormalities. I know this is not pleasant, but it’s crucial for a proper diagnosis. I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Would you prefer me to step out for a moment?
PATIENT: Step out? No, no. Just… get it over with. The quicker it's done, the better. I don't need any explanations. Just… be professional, alright? And please, please be quick. Honestly, this is… well, it's not how a man wants to spend his morning. Just do what you gotta do, and let me get out of here. And be gentle. Really gentle. This is… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to apply some lubricant and then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. I will be looking for any signs of blood, masses, or tenderness. It might be uncomfortable, but I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please take deep breaths and relax your muscles. There is stool present. No obvious masses are palpated. However, there is some dark, melena-like stool on the gloved finger. Minimal tenderness. Alright. That’s all done. Please sit up slowly.
PATIENT: Ugh. Finally. That was… unpleasant. Melena-like stool? What does that even mean? Is it bad? Honestly, this whole thing is… a nightmare. Can we just… get some answers? What’s wrong with me? Is it serious? I need to know. I don’t have time for this guessing game. Just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Based on your symptoms and the findings of the exam, the dark, melena-like stool suggests bleeding in your upper gastrointestinal tract – the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. This explains the dark, tarry stools you’ve been experiencing. It’s important to determine the source of the bleeding. The most common causes include ulcers, gastritis, or esophageal varices. However, it could also be something more serious. Given your history and symptoms, I recommend a few tests. First, a complete blood count to assess your hemoglobin levels and check for anemia. Second, an upper endoscopy – a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the source of bleeding and obtain biopsies if necessary. Finally, a stool test to confirm the presence of blood and rule out other causes of gastrointestinal bleeding. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Gastritis? Esophageal… what was it? Varices? And a… a camera down my throat? Biopsies? This sounds… serious. Really serious. Look, lady, I'm not a young man. I don't have time for… invasive procedures. Is there anything else we can do? Can’t we just… take some pills or something? I don't want a camera down my throat. It sounds… terrifying. And expensive. Honestly, this is a disaster. What if it’s something bad? What if… look, just tell me straight. Is this life-threatening? I need to know. And how much is all this going to cost? I don't even have insurance. This is… this is a nightmare. A complete and utter nightmare.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns. It’s natural to be anxious about these tests and potential diagnoses. However, an accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. The bleeding is concerning, and we need to determine the source to prevent further complications. While it's impossible to say definitively without further testing, untreated gastrointestinal bleeding can be life-threatening, leading to anemia, shock, and even death. Regarding treatment, pills alone may not be sufficient to stop the bleeding. The endoscopy allows us to visualize the source of bleeding and potentially stop it directly with cautery or medication. Regarding the cost, an upper endoscopy typically costs between $1500 and $3000, depending on the facility and complexity of the procedure. Unfortunately, I understand you mentioned not having insurance. I can direct you to resources that offer financial assistance and explore options for reduced-cost care. I understand this is a lot to take in. However, delaying diagnosis and treatment could have serious consequences. I recommend scheduling the endoscopy as soon as possible. We can also discuss medication options to temporarily manage your symptoms while we wait for the procedure. Do you have any questions about these options?
PATIENT: $1500 to $3000? Are you kidding me? I don't have that kind of money! Financial assistance? That's just… paperwork and runaround. I've dealt with that before. It’s a waste of time. And a camera down my throat… it just sounds awful. Look, I appreciate you explaining things, but… honestly, this is too much. I’m an old man. Maybe… maybe it’s just my time. I don't want to spend my remaining days filling out forms and undergoing invasive procedures. Is there… is there anything else I can do? Just to… manage the symptoms? Something… temporary? I don’t want to put myself through all that, just to… end up worse off. Honestly, I think I'd rather just… accept my fate. It’s probably just best. I'm tired. So very tired. This is... a nightmare. A complete disaster. Just… tell me what I can do to feel a little better. Something simple. Something… cheap. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your feelings. However, simply ignoring the problem isn’t a responsible option. While I respect your autonomy, I have a duty to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes recommending a thorough workup. While waiting for an endoscopy, we can try to manage your symptoms with medication. I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – like omeprazole – to reduce stomach acid production, which may help slow down the bleeding. I can also recommend an iron supplement to address any anemia. However, please understand that these are temporary measures. They won’t address the underlying cause of the bleeding, and they may not be sufficient to prevent further complications. Regarding cost, I can also provide a referral to a gastroenterologist who offers sliding-scale fees or accepts patients without insurance. I can also connect you with resources that offer financial assistance for endoscopy procedures. I strongly recommend reconsidering the endoscopy, but ultimately, the decision is yours. If you choose to proceed with symptom management alone, I will document your refusal in your medical record and provide you with instructions on monitoring your symptoms and seeking immediate medical attention if they worsen. Do you have any questions about these options?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Do the pills. The… proton pump inhibitor, you called it. And the iron. Just… get me the prescription. I don’t want to deal with any more paperwork or runaround. Just… write it and let me leave. And… alright. Give me the information about the gastroenterologist. The one with the sliding fees. I’ll… I’ll look into it. But no promises. I’m just… tired. So very tired. Just… get me the prescription. That’s all I ask. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are your prescriptions, and this list contains the contact information for gastroenterologists in the area who offer financial assistance. Please follow up with a primary care physician regularly to monitor your condition and address any concerns. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe weakness, dizziness, or black, tarry stools – seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Thank you. Just… thank you. For everything. .
