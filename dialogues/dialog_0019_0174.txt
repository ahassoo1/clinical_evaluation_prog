DOCTOR: Good morning, Nani. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, to be honest. I haven’t been feeling myself lately. Just… down. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. And truthfully, I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani, we’ll move at your pace. “Down” can mean a lot of things. It's good you came in to discuss it. Can you tell me a little more about what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s… a heaviness, really. Not physical, though. More… in my spirit, perhaps? I don’t enjoy things anymore. My grandchildren call, and I find myself… not wanting to talk. I used to love hearing about their school, but now it feels like… effort. And I sleep too much. Or don’t sleep enough. It varies. Honestly, it’s all rather muddled. It’s been going on for… oh, several months now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Several months, alright. That certainly sounds like it's impacting your life, and it’s good you’re recognizing that. Losing interest in things you used to enjoy is a key thing to pay attention to. And the sleep changes – that’s important too. Now, when you say “sleep changes,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, some nights I can’t get to sleep at all. Just lie there, thinking… mostly worrying, I suppose. And other nights, I sleep… too deeply. And then I wake up feeling more tired than when I went to bed. It’s very inconsistent. And then, during the day, I just… nap. Whenever I can, really. It’s… disruptive. It makes it hard to keep up with things. I used to be very active, you know. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguard in the summer. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Ski patrol and lifeguard… wow, that is active! It sounds like this has really taken a toll on your energy levels. Okay. So, disrupted sleep, loss of interest in things you enjoy, and feeling tired even after sleeping. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Nani?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it’s almost gone. I used to enjoy cooking, Nigerian cuisine, of course – jollof rice, egusi soup – but now… the thought of it just… doesn’t appeal. My daughter keeps bringing me food, trying to get me to eat, but I just pick at it. I’ve lost weight, she says. I haven't bothered to check, truthfully. It’s just… another thing. Another effort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appetite loss, weight loss, sleep changes, loss of interest… these are all things we want to explore. Now, thinking a bit more broadly, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… well, sometimes I feel… a little shaky. Not all the time, just occasionally. And… oh, yes. I’ve been more forgetful lately. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was just saying. Nothing major, but… noticeable. My daughter pointed it out. She worries, you know. I suppose it’s natural. But truthfully, Doctor, I don’t know what’s happening to me. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Nani, that’s not too much to ask at all. It sounds like you've been experiencing a number of changes, and it’s completely understandable you want to feel like yourself again. The shakiness and forgetfulness are good things to mention. Just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your mood, besides feeling down?
PATIENT: Well… I wouldn’t say happy, certainly. And I get… irritated, easily. Snapping at people, things like that. It’s not like me. I used to be very patient. And… sometimes I just feel… empty. Like there’s nothing inside. It’s a strange feeling. I don’t… I don’t enjoy my grandchildren’s company as much as I used to, and that worries me greatly. I don't want to be a burden. I just… wish I knew what was wrong with me. Can we please just find out what it is and fix it? I really have other commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Nani, and I assure you we’ll do our best to figure things out. It sounds like we need to explore a few possibilities. To help me do that, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Get it over with quickly, please. I had… high blood pressure, years ago. Managed with medication for a while, then the doctor said it was under control and I could stop taking it. That was… oh, ten years ago, perhaps? And I had a hip replacement five years ago. That went well, no complications. Other than that… nothing major, I believe. I’ve always been quite healthy, until recently. I really don't understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed in the past, and a hip replacement five years ago. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Not at all. I stopped taking everything after the blood pressure was under control. I prefer to avoid medication if possible, you see. All those side effects... I don't need any more problems. And honestly, Doctor, are these questions really necessary? I’ve told you how I feel. Isn’t that enough? I have a luncheon to attend at two o'clock.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Nani. These questions help me get a complete picture, and it's important to rule out any other potential causes for how you’re feeling. It’s also good to know if there’s anything that might interact with potential treatments. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I eat everything, I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Truly. Honestly, Doctor, I feel as though I’m being interrogated. Is this standard procedure? I'm a very simple woman. I just want to feel better and get back to my life. Can we please move on to… whatever you do next? Testing, perhaps? I don't have much time.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to want to get to the bottom of this, Nani, and I apologize if it feels like an interrogation. I just want to be thorough. Okay. Given what you’ve told me, and your history, I think it’s best to start with some blood work. This will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical issues that could be contributing to how you’re feeling. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. Blood work is fine. As long as it’s quick. And you’re certain it won’t take long? I have to be at that luncheon by two o'clock, and it’s quite a drive. And afterwards, I promised my daughter I would help with the garden. Honestly, Doctor, I have a very busy afternoon. Let’s just get this over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. It shouldn't take long at all. I'll write you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The phlebotomist will take care of you. Once they’re done, you can come back, and we'll discuss the next steps. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, if you start to feel worse – if you experience any thoughts of harming yourself or others, or if you develop a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. This is a precaution, of course, but it’s important to be safe. Here's the lab order. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just… the blood work. And please, quickly. I really must be going. Thank you, Doctor. Though I’m not entirely convinced this will help, I appreciate your efforts.
