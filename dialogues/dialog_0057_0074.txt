DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Venna, please. My blood pressure's been a bit high, the nurse told me. Been feelin' alright, mostly, but I figured I oughta get it checked out. Don't want no trouble later on.
DOCTOR: Of course, Venna. It’s good of you to be proactive about your health. The nurse gave me a quick overview, but could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your blood pressure being a bit high?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Honestly, I don't rightly remember when I first noticed. It was at the grocery store, I think. They have one of those machines you can use. It was a little higher than usual, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Then the nurse at the senior center checked it a couple times, and she said I should come see a doctor. It hasn't been botherin' me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it was detected at the grocery store and confirmed by the nurse at the senior center. And you haven't experienced any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No, not a one. I feel… normal. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just gettin' old, I reckon. I bake a lot, you know? Keeps me busy, but it’s good work. No headaches, no dizzy spells, and my eyesight's still pretty good for ninety years old.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear you’re still so active! Baking is excellent. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, Doctor. My knees ain't what they used to be, but I manage. Oh, and I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago – maybe twenty years back? They fixed it with a… a little wire, I think. A stent, that's what they called it. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, for my age. I eat pretty good, mostly. Not much fast food, I can tell you that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a stent placement about 20 years ago. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned aches and pains, are those constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: They come and go, mostly. Worse when it’s cold or rainy, you know? I try to keep movin’ though. Doctor says keep movin’. Baking helps with that, I suppose. Gets me up and down, reachin' and stirrin'. It’s better than sittin’ around, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent advice from your doctor, and staying active is wonderful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My mama, she had a weak heart, I remember. She passed when she was pretty young, maybe in her sixties. And my daddy, he had… somethin’ with his blood sugar, I think. Maybe diabetes? It was a long time ago, and folks didn’t talk about things as much back then. My brother, he was healthy as a horse, though. Never had a day’s illness in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart issues on your mother’s side and possible diabetes on your father’s side. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, knock on wood. I take a little somethin’ for my knees sometimes, but that’s all. Just an over-the-counter pain reliever. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And could you tell me the name of that over-the-counter pain reliever you take for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, land sakes... let me think. It’s… it’s the one with the red cap. Ibuprofen, that’s it! Yes, ibuprofen. The regular kind, not the fancy gelcaps or anything. Just the plain ibuprofen. I don't take it every day, just when my knees are botherin' me real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed. Thank you. Now, just to be thorough, have you been using any other supplements or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I don't mess with none of that fancy stuff. Give me a good apple pie and a cup of tea any day. I like to know what I'm puttin' in my body, and I don't trust those things. My mama always said, "Stick to what you know," and that’s what I do.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible, Venna. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind. Just be gentle with my knees, please. They ain't as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, though there is a faint murmur. This is not necessarily concerning, given your history of a stent, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound good and clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. And your pulse is 72, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently examine your knees. I’m feeling some mild tenderness on both sides of your knees, and I can feel some crepitus – that’s a grating sensation. That’s common with age and arthritis. Do you feel any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not too bad, mostly just when you press right there. It’s just a dull ache, not a sharp pain. It’s worse when the weather’s cold, like it has been lately. It doesn't keep me from bakin’, though. I can still get around, just a little slower, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Alright, Venna. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems you’re managing well overall for your age. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you have some mild arthritis in your knees. The murmur I heard is likely related to your previous stent placement, but we should monitor it. I’d like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. I also want to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… alright. Sounds like a lot, but if that’s what you think’s best. I don't know much about all that fancy stuff, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will these tests tell me if my heart is alright? And will they tell me if my sugar is too high? I’ve been eatin’ a lot of apple pie lately…
DOCTOR: Yes, those tests will give us a lot more information about your overall health. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm and look for any abnormalities. The blood work will check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and, yes, your blood sugar. We’ll be able to see if your blood sugar is elevated and if you’re at risk for diabetes. We’ll also check your electrolytes, just to make sure everything is in balance. It’s good you mention the apple pie! It’s okay to enjoy treats, but we want to make sure it’s not affecting your health. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the EKG for you. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay active and eating a balanced diet. We can discuss the results and develop a plan to manage your blood pressure and keep you healthy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ it all so clearly. A few days, alright. I reckon I can cut back on the apple pie… just a little. And keep movin’, like you said. I appreciate you takin’ the time to look after me. It’s good to know someone’s keepin’ an eye on things. I guess I'll let the nurse draw my blood then. When will the EKG be scheduled?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. I'm happy to help. The nurse will take care of the blood work right away. She'll also schedule your EKG, likely within the next couple of days, depending on availability. We'll call you as soon as the results are back to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. You've answered everything I was worryin’ about. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate you listenin’ to an old woman ramble on. I’ll go see the nurse now, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It’s my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
