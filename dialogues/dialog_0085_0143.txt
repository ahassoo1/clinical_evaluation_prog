DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she… wants a baby. And she thought I should come talk to someone first? Something about making sure… everything is okay before she starts trying? I don't really understand all of it, to be honest. It’s been a long time since I… well, never mind. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It is a bit complicated, and it's very thoughtful of your daughter to want to make sure everything is healthy before starting a family. It’s also common to have questions, especially after some time has passed. So, you’re here for a pre-conception consultation, essentially to assess your overall health and see if there are any potential factors that might affect things. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: My… general health? Hmm. Well, I’m 66, so things aren’t exactly like they used to be. I get tired easier, that's for sure. And my knees… they bother me, especially when the weather is bad. I mostly just take it easy these days. I used to be a Sales Engineer, traveling a lot, but I retired a few years back. I don't really go to the doctor much, if that makes sense. I only go when something is really wrong. Do you… need to know about any illnesses? I’ve had the usual colds and flus, I suppose. Nothing major, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, thank you. Knowing your history of generally good health, aside from the tiredness and knee pain, is good. And it’s fine that you don't typically go to the doctor often. We'll just try to get a good picture of things now. When you say “the usual colds and flus”, have you ever been diagnosed with any specific medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood… pressure? Hmm. I think the doctor mentioned it once, a long time ago. Maybe when I was younger? But I don’t remember being put on any medicine for it. No… no diabetes, I don’t think. And my heart… never had any trouble with my heart, as far as I know. I used to be pretty active, walked a lot with my job. Maybe a little bit of cholesterol, but nothing serious. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. I don’t keep track of these things. Would it help if I asked my daughter? She’s better at remembering these details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very common for details to be fuzzy, especially over time. And yes, asking your daughter would be very helpful. Before we ask her, let's try to cover what you remember. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was playing football. But that was just a simple break, nothing complicated. I don’t think I’ve been in the hospital for anything serious since then. No… nothing major, like heart surgery or anything like that. Just the tonsils and the arm. I’m pretty sure. It’s just… so long ago, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Tonsils as a child and a broken arm – good to know. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not really. I take some… something for my knees sometimes, when they're really bothering me. It's just an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen. Nothing regularly. And… no vitamins or supplements. I don’t really believe in those things, to be honest. I try to eat healthy, but that’s about it. Just the ibuprofen for my knees, when I need it. That’s all. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, just as-needed ibuprofen for your knees. And you don’t take any other medications or supplements. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a difficult one. My father… he had some trouble with his heart, I think. Something about… a blockage? But he lived to be a pretty old age, so it couldn’t have been too bad. And my mother… she had cancer, a long time ago. Breast cancer, I think it was. But again, that was a long time ago, and I don’t really know the details. My sister… she’s healthy, as far as I know. It’s hard to say, really. We don’t really talk about these things much. It’s… not a comfortable topic. Would it help if I asked my daughter? She knows more about the family history.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's not uncommon for family medical history to be vague or difficult to recall. And yes, asking your daughter would be very helpful. Before we ask her, let’s finish up with a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. Never had the urge. Always thought it was a bad habit. My wife… she used to smoke, a long time ago, but she quit years and years ago. But me? Never. Always been a healthy person, mostly. At least, I try to be. Well, aside from my knees.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And that's a good habit. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I have a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing major. I don't drink to excess, never have. It's just… a little something to relax. Nothing like… a whole bottle or anything like that. Just a glass of wine. Is that okay? I don't want to cause any problems.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Verrall. A glass of wine occasionally is not a concern. Finally, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. No, not really. I don't think so. I've never had any bad reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of hay fever sometimes, when the pollen is bad, but that's about it. Nothing serious. No food allergies, no allergies to medicine, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Well, aside from getting old. That's an allergy to being young, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Verrall, that gives me a good starting point. It sounds like you’re generally healthy, with some occasional knee pain and a family history of heart disease and cancer. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better picture of your current health status. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I don't mind. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. I’m not as flexible as I used to be, you know. And my knees… well, you know about my knees. But go ahead, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verrall. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not critically high. We’ll want to monitor that. Next, I’ll check your pulse. 72 and regular. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Everything looks normal here. Finally, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Soft and non-tender. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Mr. Verrall, though your blood pressure is a little elevated, and we’ll want to keep an eye on that. Do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: No… not really. It all sounds… good, I suppose. Just as long as everything is working, that’s what matters. The blood pressure… is that something I should worry about? My daughter… she worries about everything. Should I be taking something for that? Or changing my diet? She’s always telling me I should eat more vegetables. But honestly, I don’t think I could eat any more vegetables.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re thinking about these things, Mr. Verrall. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but it’s not immediately alarming. We can certainly discuss lifestyle modifications – like diet and exercise – that might help lower it. And yes, increasing your vegetable intake is generally a good idea, but it’s not a magic bullet. Before we make any decisions, I’d like to order some blood work. This will give us a more complete picture of your overall health and help us identify any potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps, I'm happy to do it. Blood work… alright. What exactly will it show? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles much. My wife… she always had to hold my hand when I got shots. Will it be a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Verrall. It's very common to be a little anxious about needles. The blood work will give us a comprehensive look at several things: your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count to check for any abnormalities. As for the needles, it will be a standard blood draw, just a few vials of blood taken from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. It’s usually not very painful, and our phlebotomist is very skilled. It’s really just a small amount of blood, less than a soda bottle’s worth, I promise. And yes, you’re welcome to have your daughter hold your hand if that would make you more comfortable. Would you like me to explain what each test looks for in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That might… help me relax a bit. I always worry about things when I don't understand them. So, cholesterol… that's the stuff that clogs your arteries, right? And blood sugar… that's for diabetes? And the kidney and liver… what do those do, exactly? I always forget. My wife… she used to explain all of this to me, but… it’s been a while. So, if you could just explain it in simple terms, that would be great. And what happens if something is wrong? Will I need medicine? Or… surgery?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. That’s exactly what I’m here for. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. You’re right about cholesterol. There are different types, and high levels can contribute to plaque buildup in your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease and stroke. We'll be checking your levels to see if they're within a healthy range. And yes, blood sugar is what your body uses for energy. High levels can indicate diabetes, a condition where your body doesn't properly regulate sugar. Your kidneys are like filters, removing waste products from your blood. Your liver is like a processing plant, performing many essential functions. Checking their function ensures they're working properly. If something is abnormal, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll need medicine or surgery. Often, lifestyle modifications – like diet, exercise, and stress management – can make a big difference. If those aren't enough, we can discuss medication options or, in rare cases, referral to a specialist. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We'll wait for the results and then discuss them in detail. Does that help ease your mind a little bit?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. It’s good to know you don’t jump to conclusions. My daughter… she always worries about the worst-case scenario. So, what do I need to do about the blood work? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where do I go? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor's appointment next week, so I’d like to have the results by then, if possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. For this blood work, we do need you to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. You can go to the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital, it's just down the street here at 123 Main Street. Here’s a requisition form with all the details. It also has the lab’s phone number if you have any questions. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you as soon as they’re available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail, ideally before your appointment next week. Do you have any questions about the fasting requirements or the location of the lab?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Fasting… no food, just water. St. Jude’s Hospital… 123 Main Street. And Sarah will call when the results are back. Alright. That sounds… manageable. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little less anxious now. I suppose there’s nothing more to do then, except go get the blood work done. I appreciate your patience with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was my pleasure. And please don’t think of yourself as “an old man.” You’re being proactive about your health, and that’s admirable. If you have any questions at all – before, during, or after the blood work – please don't hesitate to call the clinic. And remember, we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, Mr. Verrall, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: .
