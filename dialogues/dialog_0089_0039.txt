DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lindsey. Well, my regular doctor – Dr. Olson, lovely woman – she ran some tests and said my cholesterol was a bit high. She thought I should come see someone, just to be safe. It’s all a bit new to me, to be honest. Never had trouble with that before.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindsey, that’s perfectly alright. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Dr. Olson sounds like a good doctor. High cholesterol is common as we get older, but definitely something we want to look at. Just to confirm, you said Dr. Olson ran some tests recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. About a month ago, now. Routine check-up, and she added the cholesterol test. She said something about good and bad cholesterol… I didn’t quite catch all of it, to be honest. My ears aren't what they used to be! But she seemed a little worried, so I figured it was best to get it checked out by someone who really knows what they're talking about.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be a lot to take in. And it's smart to get a second opinion, or at least have it reviewed by another doctor. Alright, I see the results here. Your total cholesterol is elevated, as she noted, and your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is a bit high. Your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is… well, it’s a little on the low side. Do you happen to know what your numbers were, if Dr. Olson shared them with you?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… she did write it down on a piece of paper. Here we go. Total cholesterol… 240, I think. LDL was 160… and the good one, HDL… 35. Does that mean anything to you, Doctor? I’m not good with numbers, never have been.
DOCTOR: Yes, those numbers are helpful, thank you. Okay, 240 for total cholesterol is above the ideal range. We generally want that below 200. And 160 for LDL is also higher than we’d like – ideally, we aim for under 100, and certainly under 130. The HDL at 35 is a bit low; we want to see that above 40, preferably above 60. Now, Lindsey, before we talk about treatment, I'd like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of arthritis in my knees for a while, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Never had any trouble with my heart, and my blood pressure’s always been fine, as far as I know. I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, honestly. Just a bit slower these days! I used to be a carpenter, you see, so plenty of physical work for years. But I retired about ten years ago now.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Lindsey. A history of good health is a great foundation. And carpentry is good, physical work – keeps you strong! Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father… he lived to be 85. He was a strong Swede, just like me. He always said a little hard work and good food was the key to a long life. He did have some trouble with his heart towards the end, though. Something about clogged arteries, I think? But he didn’t take much care of himself, always smoked a pipe and ate a lot of rich food. My mother… she passed away when I was young, didn’t live to be very old. Can’t really recall anything about her health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, your father had heart issues later in life, and your mother passed away young. That gives us something to consider. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always warned me off them. Said they were a waste of money and bad for your lungs. And I've always been pretty careful about what I eat, too. Not fancy food, mind you. Just good, hearty meals. Lots of potatoes, some vegetables, and a bit of meat. I do enjoy a good piece of pie now and then, though! My wife used to make the best apple pie…
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Lindsey. Avoiding smoking is excellent, and a balanced diet is key. And a good piece of pie is a perfectly acceptable treat! Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit. I have a glass of sherry with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy, just a small glass. My wife and I used to enjoy it together. It helps me relax, you know? But it's not every night, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week. And never anything strong. Just a little sherry.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few glasses of sherry a week is good to know. And that’s perfectly alright. Now, let’s talk about any medications you’re currently taking, if any. And also any allergies you may have.
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never been much of a pill-taker. Always figured a good night’s sleep and a healthy diet was the best medicine. As for allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with bee stings or anything like that. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy in the summer, but that’s just the heat, I reckon. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or known allergies – that's good to hear. Okay, Lindsey, I think I have a good understanding of your overall health. Now, before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Been a bit since I had a proper check-up, so it probably wouldn’t hurt. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table here, that’s great. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/85. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not a strong murmur, and it may not be anything to worry about, but it’s something I want to document. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good. Overall, you seem to be in relatively good physical condition for your age. But that slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur are things we’ll need to address.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn’t sound too bad, Doctor. Murmur, you say? Never heard of that before. Is that serious? I mostly just worry about my knees these days, to be honest. They ache something awful when the weather changes. But I suppose high cholesterol and blood pressure are more important.
DOCTOR: A heart murmur is just an extra sound heard when listening to your heart. It’s often harmless, especially in older adults, and can be due to various things – sometimes just normal changes in the heart valves. But it’s something we need to be aware of. Your knees are definitely important too, and we can talk about that briefly at the end if you’d like. Now, given your cholesterol numbers, your blood pressure, and the murmur, I think the best course of action would be to start you on a statin medication to lower your cholesterol, and to recommend some lifestyle changes. We'll also want to monitor your blood pressure more closely. Would you be open to trying a statin?
PATIENT: A pill, you say? I never been much for taking pills, Doctor. I always figured my body knows what it's doing. Are there any other options? Maybe something with diet, or exercise? I can’t go running marathons at my age, mind you, but I could probably manage a bit of walking. And I could cut back on the pie, I suppose… though that’s a hard one.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Lindsey. You're right to consider all options. We can definitely start with lifestyle modifications. Diet and exercise are very important. Cutting back on saturated fats and cholesterol-rich foods, and increasing your fiber intake can help. As for exercise, even a brisk 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a significant difference. And, yes, perhaps a slight reduction in pie intake wouldn't hurt! However, given your cholesterol levels and your age, I do strongly recommend considering a statin medication. Statins are very effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke. We can start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. It’s also important to remember that these medications are generally very safe. We can try lifestyle changes for three months, and then recheck your cholesterol levels. If they haven't improved sufficiently, we can revisit the statin option. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Three months… that sounds reasonable. Give my body a chance to adjust, and me a chance to try a bit harder with the walking and the pie. I suppose if it’s really important for my heart, I could try the pill if I have to. But I want to start with the lifestyle changes, and see if that makes a difference. And I want to understand exactly why I need the pill, if it comes to that. What kind of risks are we talking about? And what does the pill actually do?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Lindsey. And you absolutely deserve to understand everything before making a decision. Okay, so cholesterol, particularly LDL – the “bad” cholesterol – can build up in the arteries, forming plaque. This plaque narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. This can lead to chest pain, heart attack, or stroke. Statins work by blocking an enzyme in your liver that produces cholesterol. This lowers the amount of cholesterol in your blood, reducing the risk of plaque buildup. As for risks, statins can sometimes cause muscle aches, and rarely, liver problems. That's why we monitor your liver function with blood tests while you're on the medication. We’ll start with a low dose of a statin called Atorvastatin, 10mg once daily. If you experience any muscle aches, or any other concerning symptoms, you should let me know immediately. We can adjust the dose, or switch to a different medication if needed. And we’ll recheck your cholesterol levels in three months to see how you’re responding. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Atorvastatin… 10mg… I’ll try to remember that. So, diet and walking for three months, then recheck. And if that doesn't work, the pill. And you’ll check my liver… just to make sure I don't get too sick. That sounds… alright. A bit daunting, but alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re talking about. What about the walking? How fast do I need to walk? And how far? My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Lindsey. And it’s good to be cautious. You’re right to ask questions. For the walking, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Moderate intensity means you should be able to talk while walking, but not sing. As for speed, it doesn’t need to be a race! A brisk pace is fine. And, most importantly, listen to your body. If your knees are aching, slow down or take a break. You can also break it up into shorter walks throughout the day – 10 minutes three times a day is just as effective as one 30-minute walk. I’m going to write you a prescription for the Atorvastatin, just in case. But we’ll hold off on starting it for now. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for three months, so we can recheck your cholesterol levels and see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A prescription, just in case. And a follow-up appointment. Three months. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It makes me feel a lot better, knowing what’s going on. And knowing that I have options. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any foods I should avoid completely? Or anything else I need to remember?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindsey. It’s my pleasure. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. As for foods, try to limit saturated and trans fats, which are found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Cholesterol is also found in egg yolks, but you don’t necessarily need to avoid eggs completely – moderation is key. Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Also, if you experience any unexplained muscle pain or weakness, or any signs of liver problems – such as jaundice – you should contact me immediately. Other than that, just try to stay active, eat a healthy diet, and listen to your body. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll try my best with the walking and the healthy eating. And I'll keep an eye out for any muscle aches or yellow skin. Thank you again for taking the time to explain everything. I feel much better prepared now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lindsey. I’m glad I could help. Please, take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in three months. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day. .
