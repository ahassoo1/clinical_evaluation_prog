DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Ka Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Dr. Gegan. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’ve been having some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough estimate of how long that is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, about three weeks ago. Maybe a little longer, but definitely around three weeks. It's been fairly consistent since then, though some days are worse than others.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, okay. And can you describe the pressure for me?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… like I constantly have to go to the bathroom, even when I don’t. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. Like a fullness, a heavy feeling, right there. And sometimes, when I do go, it takes a little while to actually get everything out, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, thank you for explaining that clearly. So, a constant urge to go, a feeling of fullness, and some difficulty emptying your bladder… Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, or anything like blood?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. The color seems normal, as far as I can tell – a usual yellow. I haven’t noticed any unusual odor either. Everything seems normal in that regard, just the constant pressure and the difficulty emptying is the issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this – fever, chills, back pain, or any pain in your abdomen besides the pressure you've described?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, thankfully. My back has felt a little sore, now that you mention it, but I usually attribute that to work – I spend a lot of time at my computer. The pressure is really the main thing, and it hasn’t been accompanied by anything else significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like urinary tract infections, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I've always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No history of urinary tract infections or kidney problems, or anything like that. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, and nothing has ever come up during those.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Not a single one. I’ve been very lucky in that regard as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Does anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or any similar urinary problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had some bladder infections when she was older, but nothing major, as far as I know. She just said it happened a couple of times when she was in her seventies. My father was very healthy, and I don’t recall any urinary problems on either side of the family, to be honest. I’d say no, not really. Nothing significant.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I'm married, as I mentioned. I work as a graphic designer, so I spend a lot of time sitting at a desk. I drink a fair amount of water throughout the day, probably six or eight glasses. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. A pretty quiet life, all in all.
DOCTOR: Alright, very good. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or anything I’ve eaten. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Thank you for providing me with all of that information, Marialena. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle external exam of your abdomen and lower back. We might also do a quick urine sample to check for any signs of infection. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Gegan. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary. A urine sample sounds sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could follow me into this room, we can start with the urine sample, and then I’ll perform the exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point during the exam. Okay, I've reviewed the urine sample and it appears clear, no signs of infection at this time. Now, let's just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently palpate your lower abdomen and lower back. Alright, I’m not detecting any tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are normal. I’m noting some mild discomfort upon palpation of your lower bladder area, consistent with what you’ve described. Your lower back feels relatively normal, no significant tenderness there.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Gegan. It’s good to know that nothing serious seems to be apparent. The mild discomfort you felt… is that concerning? Is it possible it’s just… stress, perhaps? I've been a little busier than usual at work lately.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, and it’s good you’re considering all possibilities. Stress can certainly contribute to muscle tension and discomfort, including in the bladder area. However, given the persistence of your symptoms for three weeks, and the difficulty emptying your bladder, I don't want to dismiss other potential causes. It could be something like an overactive bladder, or even interstitial cystitis, although we would need further testing to confirm that. Given your age and medical history, I'm not immediately concerned about anything serious, but it's best to investigate further. I'd like to start with a bladder diary for the next three days. Basically, you'll record every time you drink fluids, every time you urinate, and the amount you urinate. This will give us a better understanding of your bladder function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, a bladder diary sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to do that. I understand the need to gather more information. It’s better to be thorough. Is there a specific form I should use, or can I just write it down in a notebook?
DOCTOR: You can certainly use a notebook, that works just fine. Just try to be as detailed as possible – time of fluid intake, type of fluid, amount, time of urination, and an estimate of the amount of urine. If you experience any leakage or urgency, please note that as well. After three days, please bring the diary back, and we can review it together. Based on that information, we may consider further testing, such as a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate, or potentially a referral to a urologist for more specialized evaluation. Does that sound like a plan you’re comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very sensible plan, Dr. Gegan. I will keep a detailed diary as you’ve instructed. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly and taking the time to listen to my concerns. I feel much better knowing we have a course of action. Is there anything else I should be aware of in the meantime? Should I adjust my diet or fluid intake in any way?
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Marialena. You're very welcome. For the time being, I wouldn’t make any major changes to your diet or fluid intake. Continue drinking the amount of water you normally do, and avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol, as these can sometimes irritate the bladder. If you find that certain foods seem to worsen your symptoms, you can try to reduce your intake of those, but don’t make any drastic changes until we’ve reviewed your bladder diary. The most important thing is to keep the diary consistently and accurately. And please, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, or if you notice blood in your urine, contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Dr. Gegan. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and patience. I will keep the diary diligently and bring it back in three days. I appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Marialena. I’ll look forward to reviewing the diary with you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
