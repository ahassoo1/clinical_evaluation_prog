DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaylyne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, it's my ears, they’ve been… ringing. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's starting to get on my nerves.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s also known as tinnitus. And you said it's been going on for a “bit”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit. Maybe… three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, but lately it’s been pretty constant. It's hard to explain, sometimes it's a high pitch, other times it’s more of a buzzing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you for clarifying. A varying pitch and buzzing sensation is helpful to know. So, it's been consistent for three to four weeks, with some fluctuations. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really that I can think of. I work as a waiter, so it's pretty noisy where I work, lots of chatter and music. Maybe that? I don't know. I used to go to parties a lot, loud music, but I haven’t been to one in a while. It just… started one day. Honestly, I'm just hoping it'll go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potential noise exposure both at work and previously with parties. That’s good information. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms alongside the ringing – no dizziness, hearing loss, ear pain, or fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the ringing. It’s more annoying than painful, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes. Especially when it’s quiet. I feel like I'm always aware of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a good way to describe it, and it's common for tinnitus to be more noticeable in quiet environments. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing overall?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I'm not a musician or anything, so I don't have super sensitive hearing. But I haven’t had trouble hearing people talk, or the TV, or anything like that. It's just... this ringing. Is it something serious, Doctor? I'm a bit worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this up and voicing your concerns. Most tinnitus isn't caused by anything serious, but it's important to investigate. Let's do a quick ear exam and a basic hearing screening, if that’s alright with you. That will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that work?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing it. Let’s get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could have a seat here, we’ll start with the ear exam. I’ll use an otoscope to take a look inside your ears, then we’ll move on to the hearing screening. It involves wearing headphones and responding to tones at different pitches. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds easy enough. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, it's nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears. It might be a little chilly for a moment. Okay, your ear canals are clear, no sign of any blockage or inflammation. The eardrums look normal as well. Now, let's proceed with the hearing screening. I’m going to play some tones in each ear at different volumes. Please raise your hand whenever you hear a sound, no matter how faint. We'll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Right ear, okay. Sounds good. Just let me know when to raise my hand. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And… good. Now a little higher pitch… Okay. And… alright. Let’s switch to the left ear now. And… good. Okay. A little lower now… and… alright. One more set of tones. Okay, that’s all. Thank you for your patience, Jaylyne. Let me take a look at the results.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Glad that’s over. What do you think? Is it bad? Is there something seriously wrong? I'm starting to get a bit anxious now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaylyne, the results show a mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. It's not severe, but it is present. This aligns with your history of noise exposure – working as a waiter and previous attendance at parties. The tinnitus is likely related to this mild hearing loss. It's good that we caught this early. We can take steps to prevent it from worsening. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Mild hearing loss… so it’s not, like, a tumor or something? Okay, that’s good to hear. So, noise exposure is the cause? What can I do about the ringing? And how do I stop it from getting worse?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. The results don't indicate anything concerning like a tumor or any other structural problem. The mild hearing loss is the most likely explanation for the tinnitus. As for the ringing, unfortunately, there’s no instant cure for tinnitus. However, there are several things we can do to manage it and prevent it from worsening. First, and most importantly, is hearing protection. I recommend wearing earplugs or earmuffs in noisy environments – at work, and any other time you’re exposed to loud sounds. We can discuss different types of hearing protection that would be suitable for you. There are also some therapies that can help you cope with the tinnitus, like tinnitus retraining therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy . We could explore those options if the ringing continues to bother you. Would you be interested in learning more about those?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Hearing protection, definitely. I guess I should have been wearing them at work this whole time. Earplugs… okay. TRT and CBT… I don’t know much about those, but I’m willing to listen. What exactly are those, and would they cost extra? And can we get fitted for earplugs today? I really just want this ringing to stop.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Jaylyne. It's never too late to start protecting your hearing. TRT, or Tinnitus Retraining Therapy, involves using sound therapy and counseling to help your brain habituate to the tinnitus, essentially learning to filter it out. CBT, or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, focuses on changing the way you think about the tinnitus, reducing the anxiety and stress associated with it. Both can be very effective for managing the symptoms. Regarding cost, the TRT and CBT sessions may have an additional cost, depending on your insurance coverage. I can check with the billing department to give you a more accurate estimate. As for the earplugs, yes, we can definitely get you fitted today. We have custom-molded earplugs that provide excellent protection and comfort. I’ll have the audiologist come in and take impressions of your ears. Would you like to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let's get the ear impressions done. And please check on the cost for the therapy. I'd like to know all my options. I’m just ready to do whatever it takes to get this ringing under control. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better knowing there are things we can do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. “Could you please have the audiologist, Sarah, come in to take ear impressions for Jaylyne?
PATIENT: Okay, great. I’ll just sit here and wait then. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca. Hopefully, these earplugs will make a difference.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaylyne. I’m confident they will help. I’ll also have Sarah bring you some information about TRT and CBT while she’s here. We'll do everything we can to manage this.
