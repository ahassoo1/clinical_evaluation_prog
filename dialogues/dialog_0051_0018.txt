DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's good to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… going to the restroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say precisely. I don’t keep such detailed records, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. It's often hard to pinpoint these things exactly. A few weeks of increased frequency… okay. And would you describe it as a sudden change, or something that gradually came on?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe… gradual. Yes, that’s it. It didn’t just start one day, it was… a slow increase. Like a… a leaky faucet, perhaps. Getting a little worse over time. I do apologize for the rather imprecise description, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it once was, you see.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly alright. It’s very helpful to have some idea, even if it's approximate. A slow increase is good to know. Now, can you tell me a bit more about when you’re needing to go?
PATIENT: When… well, throughout the day, really. Not just at night, or after drinking a lot, but… just regularly. Several times during the day, and… sometimes I wake up once or twice during the night to go as well. It’s not every night, but often enough to be… disruptive. I don’t feel pain, or burning, just… the urge to go. Rather frequently, as I said. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, so multiple times throughout the day, occasionally waking you at night… and no pain or burning, just the urge to go. That's helpful information. And is it a full bladder each time, or just a small amount?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. Sometimes… a full bladder, yes. Other times… not so much. It’s… variable. I suppose. Sometimes it feels like I’ve just emptied it, and then shortly after I feel the urge again. It’s quite… perplexing, really. I’ve been trying to keep track, but it’s rather difficult to gauge, you see. Especially when one is… preoccupied with going.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verbos. It can be hard to focus on details when you’re dealing with something like this. “Variable” is a good way to put it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine itself? Hmm. I haven't… specifically examined it, Doctor. I simply… go. I haven’t noticed any… blood, I believe. Or any unusual… smell. Though, to be perfectly honest, I don't spend a great deal of time analyzing it. It appears… normal, I suppose? As normal as urine can be, anyway. Is there something I should be looking for specifically? Perhaps I could make a more concerted effort?
DOCTOR: No, no need to make any special observations at this point, Mr. Verbos. You're not expected to be a medical professional. Just knowing you haven’t noticed anything drastically different is helpful. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, I had a bout of… something with my prostate, many years ago. Decades, I believe. They… monitored it for a time, but it resolved on its own, thankfully. Other than that… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been… reasonably healthy, all things considered. I’ve never been a smoker, and I drink… occasionally. Mostly wine with dinner. Nothing excessive, you understand. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that counts. It’s difficult to remember everything, you see. My wife used to keep track of all that, but…
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. No need to elaborate if you don't wish to. Knowing about the past prostate issue is helpful, as that can sometimes contribute to urinary frequency. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had any… adverse reactions to any medication, to my knowledge. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, for minor infections, but nothing… dramatic. I haven’t taken anything regularly for a long time, aside from the multivitamin, of course. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a bee sting when I was a child. Is that relevant? It was… many years ago. And it was a sting, not a medication. But I thought I should mention it, just in case.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Verbos. The bee sting is less relevant for medication allergies, but good you remember it. So, no known medication allergies. Now, just a few more questions to get a better picture. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Well, I’ve been a little… more tired lately, perhaps. But that could be the weather. Or simply… getting older. I haven't noticed any fever, or chills, or pain anywhere. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. I haven’t lost any weight, to my knowledge. I have been… unusually thirsty, now that you mention it. I find myself reaching for a glass of water more often than usual. Is that… connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst along with the frequent urination and fatigue… yes, that is certainly relevant. Increased thirst can be a sign of several things, and it’s good you mentioned it. Now, to get a clearer understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Yes, please. I trust your judgment entirely. Do you need me to… remove any clothing? Or simply… a listening device?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. Just your regular clothing is fine for now. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need to palpate your abdomen. After that, I'd like to do a quick neurological exam, just to rule out anything concerning. And finally, I'll need to check your prostate, if you don't mind. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, but no… sharp pain. Just a… slight pressure. It’s difficult to say, really. I’m not accustomed to being… prodded in this manner. Oh! There. That’s a little… sensitive. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. A little tenderness in that area is not necessarily alarming, but it's good to be aware of it. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I believe so. It’s… a little blurry at the edges, but I’m following it. It requires… concentration. Is that… normal? It feels… tiring, to be honest. I haven’t been asked to do this in… many years. Oh! There it is. Sorry. It’s… a little difficult.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verbos. It is quite normal for things to feel a little tiring, and it's good we're noting these observations. Now, I’m going to need to perform a quick digital rectal exam to check your prostate. I understand this can be uncomfortable, and I’ll do my best to make it as brief and comfortable as possible. I'll let you know what I’m doing beforehand. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? Yes, I suppose so. It’s… not a particularly pleasant thought, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. If it’s necessary for a proper diagnosis, then… proceed. Please be… gentle. And… perhaps let me know when you’re finished?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I will absolutely let you know when I’m finished. I’m going to explain each step as I go. First, I’m just going to ask you to lean forward slightly… and take a few deep breaths. Okay, Mr. Verbos. That’s all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, and there is some mild tenderness. It’s not alarming, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Based on what we’ve discussed, your symptoms, and the physical exam, I believe it’s likely you may have Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men your age, where the prostate gland enlarges, causing frequent urination and other symptoms. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: BPH… is that… serious, Doctor? Enlarged prostate, you say? That does… explain a few things, perhaps. It’s a relief to have some… understanding, at least. Tests, you say? Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause, and… alleviate the symptoms. Please proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. What sort of tests are we talking about? A blood test, perhaps? And… anything else?
DOCTOR: BPH isn't typically dangerous, Mr. Verbos, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. It’s very manageable with treatment. Yes, we’ll start with a blood test to check your kidney function and PSA levels. PSA stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen, and it can help us rule out other conditions. We’ll also need a urinalysis to check for any infection. And finally, I’d like to order a urine flow study, where you’ll urinate into a container while we measure the speed and volume of your flow. This will give us more information about how your bladder is functioning. I’ll write you the orders for these tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the front desk will schedule the urine flow study for you. Do you have any questions about these tests, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Blood test, urinalysis, and a urine flow study… yes, I believe I understand. PSA levels… that sounds a little… concerning, if I’m honest. Is that something serious, Doctor? And the urine flow study… will that be… uncomfortable? I suppose not, but I’d be grateful for some reassurance. And, if you don't mind, could you perhaps explain the results to me in… plain language? I’m not a medical professional, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable question, Mr. Verbos. PSA levels can be elevated for several reasons, and a higher level doesn't automatically mean there's something serious. It could be due to the enlarged prostate, or simply inflammation. That’s why we’re doing the other tests as well, to get a complete picture. The urine flow study is very straightforward and shouldn't be uncomfortable. You'll just urinate as you normally would into a container while a machine measures the speed and volume of your flow. It takes just a few minutes. And absolutely, I’ll explain the results to you in plain language, without any medical jargon. My goal is to make sure you understand everything that’s going on and feel comfortable with the treatment plan. Once we have the test results, we can discuss the best options for managing your symptoms. These could include lifestyle changes, medication, or, in some cases, a minor procedure. But let's focus on getting the tests done first. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… that sounds… manageable. And medication, if necessary. I suppose it’s all rather daunting, but I’m grateful for your… clear explanations, Doctor. And your patience. No, I believe that’s all for now. Just… get the tests done, and we’ll see what the results say. Thank you, Doctor Glazewski. I appreciate your time, and your… reassurance. I’ll head down to the lab now, and schedule the urine flow study with the front desk.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. The front desk will contact you to schedule that once the test results are available. Have a good day, and please take care.
