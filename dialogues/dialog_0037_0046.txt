DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, pressure on my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. I understand. And when you say “a little while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, around the beginning of June. So, roughly two months now. It’s not constant, but it’s frequent enough that it’s becoming a bit concerning. I can usually tell when it's going to happen, but sometimes it just… comes on.
DOCTOR: Alright, starting in early June, roughly two months. Intermittent, but frequent enough to be concerning. And you mentioned it sometimes “just comes on.” Can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to explain. It’s not painful, exactly. More like a very strong urge to go, suddenly. Like I need to go right now, even if I just went a short time ago. It's… startling, I suppose. And then it subsides after I’m able to go to the restroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sudden, strong urge to urinate, even shortly after emptying your bladder. Not painful, but startling. And it resolves when you’re able to go to the restroom. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this, Marialena?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been feeling more tired than usual, even with enough sleep. And… well, I’ve noticed I’m drinking more water than I normally do. I thought it was just the summer heat, but now I wonder if it's connected. I don’t believe I’ve had a fever, though.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and fatigue along with the bladder pressure. Okay. And has there been any change in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I… haven’t really paid close attention, to be honest. I’ll try to be more mindful of that. It looks normal, I think, but I haven't specifically checked for anything unusual. It doesn't smell different, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Alright, no noticeable changes in color or odor. Let's move on to some other questions. Have you had any pain in your lower back or sides?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t experienced any pain in my lower back or sides. That hasn't been an issue at all. I do sometimes get a little stiff after sitting for too long at my computer, but that’s just normal for me, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no lower back or side pain, just occasional stiffness from sitting. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I haven’t seen any blood at all. That would be very concerning, and I would have noticed that immediately. I always check, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, urinary tract infections, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been diagnosed with any medical conditions. I’ve been generally very healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I’ve never had a urinary tract infection, to my knowledge, and no kidney problems either. I do have Medicare, as you can see in my file, and I see my primary care physician regularly for checkups.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no prior diagnoses of diabetes, UTIs, or kidney problems, and regular checkups with your primary care physician. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing them. I did have my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a very routine procedure. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgical history. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or bladder cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had diabetes, type 2, but she managed it with diet and exercise for many years. My father had high blood pressure, but other than that, I don't recall any major illnesses in my immediate family. No kidney disease or bladder cancer, to my knowledge. I can ask my siblings if you’d like, to be more certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of type 2 diabetes in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. No known history of kidney disease or bladder cancer. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I don’t drink regularly. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly healthy lifestyle. I try to eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications or foods. I can take most common medications without any problems. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Marialena, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie down on the table, that would be wonderful. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen, then I'll do a quick neurological check, and finally, I'll want to perform a pelvic exam. I will explain everything as I go. Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal here – no unusual noises. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are normal as well. Now, for the pelvic exam. I’m going to use a speculum to visualize your cervix and vagina. This may cause some slight discomfort, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any pain. I will also perform a bimanual exam to feel your uterus and ovaries. Okay, I'm visualizing your cervix now. It appears normal, no obvious abnormalities. Now, I'm performing the bimanual exam. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries also feel normal. No masses or tenderness detected. Okay, we're finished with the exam. Everything appears normal on physical examination, however, based on your symptoms, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or other medical condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. A urine analysis and a complete blood count seem like a good idea to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Yes, please, go ahead and order those tests. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get those orders sent to the lab right away. They should be able to draw the blood and collect a urine sample here in the clinic. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, but avoiding caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. Also, try to void regularly, even if you don't feel a strong urge to go. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all makes sense. Increasing fluids and avoiding irritants sounds like a good plan while we wait for the results. I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your time and attention.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get these tests done and go from there. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect the urine sample. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your lower back or sides, please contact the clinic immediately. It’s always better to err on the side of caution. Otherwise, I'll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any work or school restrictions that need to be documented?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any work restrictions. I’m a graphic designer, so I can work from home if needed. I appreciate you asking. And thank you again for your thoroughness and clear explanations. I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I believe that is all for now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I'll make a note of your occupation in the chart. The nurse will be with you shortly. In the meantime, feel free to relax. Have a good day, Marialena. And please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before our follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. I will contact the clinic if anything changes.
