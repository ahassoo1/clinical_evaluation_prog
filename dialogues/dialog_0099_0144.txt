DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mrs. Calvery. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. I don’t usually come to doctors unless something’s terribly wrong, you know? My Harold… my husband… he always liked to be prepared. Said preventative care was the way to go. I suppose I’m just… seeing what all the fuss is about. It's August, isn't it? Time just slips away.
DOCTOR: Right. Preventative care. Harold sounds like a sensible man. Though, frankly, "curiosity" isn’t usually a chief complaint. Still. We can certainly do a check-up. It's good you're thinking about these things. But even for a preventative visit, I need to get a little more information. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been feeling alright otherwise?
PATIENT: Alright? Oh, you know… old lady things. A little creaky in the mornings, knees aren’t what they used to be. Nothing a good cup of tea can't fix. I mostly keep to myself these days. Harold did everything when he was around. I’m… adapting. Do you need me to list every little ache? Seems a waste of time, really.
DOCTOR: No, no, I don't need a complete inventory of every minor discomfort, Mrs. Calvery. But “creaky” and knees “not being what they used to be” are something. It helps me get a baseline. Are these aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, come and go. Definitely come and go. Worse when it’s damp, you know? Like… a premonition of rain. Harold always said I could feel the weather in my bones. He was a practical man, but he indulged me. It’s just… old age, I suppose. Shouldn’t bother a young doctor like yourself.
DOCTOR: "Old age" is a very broad diagnosis, Mrs. Calvery. And while I appreciate your… self-assessment, it’s still my job to rule out anything more significant. Damp weather sensitivity can be related to arthritis, for example. Let’s move on. Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Oh dear. My sister, Eunice, had that. Terrible pain. She needed a walker. No, no walker for me. I get a little…tightness in my back sometimes, after I’ve been gardening. But I just stretch it out. A bit of ibuprofen if it’s really bad. Honestly, doctor, I'm not a complicated case.
DOCTOR: Right. Ibuprofen. And how often would you say you’re taking that, Mrs. Calvery?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not often. Maybe… once a month? Sometimes less. When I really overdo it in the garden, trying to keep things nice. Harold always said I was too ambitious with the roses. He’d trim them back, but I liked them big and bushy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, Mrs. Calvery, have you noticed any swelling in your joints – in your hands, knees, ankles, anywhere?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… not that I've noticed. My hands get a little puffy sometimes, but that's just…old age again, I suppose. Or maybe I just haven't been looking closely enough. I try not to dwell on things, you know? Keeps me from worrying. It's not like I'm doing anything strenuous. Mostly just…puttering.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s switch gears then. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Harold always handled all the doctor’s appointments. I went with him, of course, but I just… sat there. I think… high blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it, years ago. And… a touch of the arthritis, like I said. Eunice's arthritis, I mean. Worrying about her made me feel like I had it too. Honestly, I'm terrible with names and dates these days. It all blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially high blood pressure, and a family history of arthritis. Let’s check your EHR to confirm. It appears you were diagnosed with hypertension approximately ten years ago, and prescribed Lisinopril. Are you currently taking that medication?
PATIENT: Lisinopril? Oh… that name rings a bell. Harold would lay out the pills for me every morning. White one, blue one, little yellow one… I think the Lisinopril was one of them. Did I stop taking it? Oh dear. I’ve probably just been taking whatever pills Harold left me. He always thought it was best to just keep taking things, even after the doctor stopped prescribing them. A practical man, you see. It's probably fine. I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, with all due respect, taking medications without knowing what they are or why is not fine. It can be very dangerous. I need a complete list of everything you’re currently taking, even vitamins and supplements. Do you have any of the pill bottles with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're making me nervous. I think… I think there’s a bag in the kitchen. Harold always kept everything organized. A big plastic bag full of… pills. And bottles. I haven’t really looked at it since… well, since he passed. It's probably a bit of a mess. I really wasn't good with the medical things. He handled it all. It's just… a bag of pills. I'll have to ask my niece to help me sort through it. She’s good with details. It's a lot of trouble, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mrs. Calvery. And safety is the priority. Alright. Let’s start with something simpler. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Harold was always careful about what I ate, though. He didn't want me getting sick. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that's just the dry air, I think. No, no allergies. I'm a pretty sturdy woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. To finish up the initial assessment, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that mean? Well, I live alone, as I mentioned. Harold passed away three years ago. I mostly keep to myself, gardening, watching television… I used to volunteer at the church, but it’s…hard now. I just don’t have the energy, you know? It’s a quiet life. A very quiet life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever smoked cigarettes, or used any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never. Harold wouldn’t have allowed it. He was very… proper. I've never been much of a… wild woman, you see. Just tea, mostly. And a little sherry on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, I suppose so. I haven't had one in… goodness, years. I always said Harold was the healthy one. He insisted on those yearly check-ups. Will it be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Just a routine check. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'd like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I'll feel your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… all of that? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, doctor. My skin is a little sensitive these days. And I do get easily flustered. You’ll have to tell me everything you find, of course. Even if it’s… bad news. Harold always said it was best to know the truth, no matter how unpleasant. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Hmm… 150 over 88. That's a little elevated. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths. Breathing is a little labored, but clear. No wheezing or crackles detected. Now, let’s check your ears. Some cerumen buildup, but otherwise normal. Now, your nose. Nasal passages clear. And finally, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, with no noticeable masses or tenderness. Alright, Mrs. Calvery. That completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh… well, that wasn’t as bad as I feared. Everything feel alright to you, doctor? My stomach did gurgle a bit, but that’s just… tea, I suppose. So, what does it all mean? Am I terribly sick? Do I need… surgery? Harold always said I had a weak constitution.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, you’re not terribly sick. However, your blood pressure is elevated, which we need to address. It's not an immediate emergency, but left unmanaged, it can lead to more serious health problems. The gurgling is likely just gas, nothing to worry about. As for your constitution, I don't think that's the primary concern at the moment. We need to get a better handle on your current medications. That's the first step. Do you remember what pills Harold left you?
PATIENT: Oh… the pills. There was a big bottle of… white ones. And some blue ones. And little yellow ones, like I said. And some pink ones, I think. They were all in a plastic bag, mixed up. Harold wasn’t very organized when it came to that bag. He just threw everything in there. I haven't really looked at them closely. I just took what he told me to take. Honestly, it's all so confusing. It's a mess, doctor. A complete mess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. We absolutely need to sort through those pills. Do you have a niece or a family member who could help you with that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My niece, Emily. She’s very good with details. And she lives nearby. She can come over any time. She's a nurse, actually, so she'd probably know what all those pills are. She'd be happy to help. I'll call her right away. She's always been so good to me, Emily. A practical girl, just like Harold. Now, where did I put my cell phone…?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mrs. Calvery. Having Emily’s help will be invaluable. While you’re calling her, I’ll write a note recommending that she bring any empty pill bottles she finds as well. That will help us identify everything. In the meantime, I’m going to order a basic blood panel to get a baseline assessment of your kidney function and overall health. It’s just a precaution, but it’s always good to have a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, you say? Harold always said blood tests were important. Hello? Emily, dear? It's Aunt Lilly… Yes, everything's alright, but I just need your help with something… It’s about Harold’s pills. Yes, the bag in the kitchen… It’s a bit of a mess… Yes, I’m at the doctor’s now. And yes, Dr. Overgaard thinks it’s important… Alright, dear. I’ll see you soon. She's on her way. She'll be here within the hour, she said. I feel a little better now, knowing she's coming. A practical girl, Emily. Just like Harold.
DOCTOR: That's good. Emily’s help will make all the difference. In the meantime, I’ll give you a printout of instructions for the blood tests. You’ll need to fast for at least eight hours before the appointment. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll schedule the test for you. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your blood pressure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fasting? Oh dear. I do love my breakfast. But… I suppose I can skip a meal. Just for a few hours. Eight hours, you say? Will I feel… faint? Harold always made me a big breakfast after my blood tests. He said it was important to keep my strength up. This is a lot of information. I’m not very good with details, you know. I think Emily can help me with this, too. She's always been so organized. Alright. I’ll try my best. Eight hours, you say?
DOCTOR: Yes, eight hours. And don't worry about feeling faint. Just stay hydrated. If you do feel lightheaded, let the lab technician know immediately. They can provide you with a juice box or a snack. It’s just a precaution. Once Emily arrives, she can help you review the instructions and schedule the appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just taking things one step at a time. Is there anything else I can help you with before Emily arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… the fasting. And Emily. She's a good girl, Emily. She'll know what to do. Thank you, doctor. For everything. You've been very patient with me. I suppose I should just sit here and wait. Yes. Just sit and wait.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Calvery. I’m glad I could help. Just relax and wait for Emily. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
