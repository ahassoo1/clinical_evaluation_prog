DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Look, I ain't got all day. I need a paper signed, that's all. Some… procedure. A cosmetic thing. My niece, she said I need clearance from a doctor. She handles all the details, frankly. I just need it done, quick. Don't rightly remember what it is, just that it involves… smoothing things out. You understand?
DOCTOR: Smoothing things out… Right. While I appreciate you coming in, Mr. Honcoop, simply signing off on a procedure without understanding what that procedure is, or confirming you are medically fit for it, is… irresponsible, and frankly, not something I do. It's a liability for both of us. Tell me, can you recall anything more about this "smoothing out" procedure?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I told you, I don't remember. It’s… on my face, I think. Maybe? My niece, Bernice, she's the one who set it all up. She said something about… lines. And… something being tightened. Look, I ain't a doctor. I just wanna get this done and be on my way. It’s not like I’m asking for a new heart or anything. A little smoothing! Is that so much to ask? Are you trying to be difficult?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, minimizing a medical procedure because it's "just cosmetic" is… shortsighted. Any procedure carries risks. And I need to understand those risks, and your health status, before I can responsibly sign off on anything. Let’s try this. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A… primary… what now? Doctor, look, I mostly keep to myself. I fixed radios and cell towers for… a long time. Didn't need much doctorin' then. Now… not so much. I don’t have a regular doctor. Haven’t seen one in… well, a very long time. Bernice usually handles all that kinda thing if I need somethin'. She said this cosmetic thing was… simple. Don't ask me to remember details, I ain’t a computer! Are we getting anywhere here or what?
DOCTOR: Alright. Since you don’t have a primary care physician, and you’re unable to recall specifics about this procedure, we’re going to have to proceed carefully. To even consider providing medical clearance, I need to gather some basic information. Let’s start with a brief medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I mostly fixed things. Radios. Towers. I wasn't sittin' in doctor's offices. High… what was it? Blood pressure? I get a little winded climbin' ladders sometimes, does that count? No, I don't have any fancy diseases or nothin'. I eat my greens sometimes. Really, this is ridiculous. I just want a signature! Is this really necessary for a little… touch-up? I’m feelin’ a bit lightheaded just thinkin' about all these questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Since you state you experience some shortness of breath, even if occasional, and you haven’t had a recent medical evaluation, I need to perform a basic physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, and listening to your heart and lungs. It's standard procedure, and frankly, prudent given the lack of information. Can I ask you to step onto the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination table… Honestly. Fine. But make it quick. I got things to do. And don't go pokin' around too much. Just get it over with. I swear, Bernice is going to hear about this delay. She always says I should just let her handle everything... and she's probably right.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat, and I'll begin. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Again… deep breath… and exhale. Your heart rate is slightly elevated… 98 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute… a bit fast as well. Lungs sound clear bilaterally, but I do detect some mild wheezing on auscultation. Blood pressure is 145/90… that’s elevated. Mr. Honcoop, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and you report some shortness of breath and wheezing. This is concerning. Before I can consider signing off on any cosmetic procedure, we need to address these health issues. I recommend a full cardiac workup, including an EKG and potentially a chest X-ray. I will also need to discuss medication options to manage your blood pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiac… what now? And medication? Hold on just a minute! I just want a little smoothing! This is gettin' ridiculous. I don’t need a full workup just to get a little wrinkle fixed! Wheezing? I always breathe a little heavy when I’m nervous, doctor. You’re makin’ me nervous! Look, I appreciate your concern, or whatever, but I think I’ll just… go talk to Bernice. She said somethin' about another doctor she uses... a specialist or somethin'. This is just… too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Honcoop. However, I must strongly advise against undergoing any elective procedure without a proper medical evaluation. It is your health, and I would not want to see you take unnecessary risks. Here is my card. Please, if you reconsider, do not hesitate to call. .
