DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It's… well, I keep getting fevers. Come and go, you know? Been happening for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me. I just want to get it figured out, if that's alright. I don't have a lot of time today, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. Fevers are definitely something we want to look into. And I understand you're short on time, so I’ll do my best to be efficient. When you say "a little while," could you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... three, four weeks? Something like that. It's not constant, you understand? It’ll be normal for a day or two, then boom, fever again. Usually in the evenings, I think. It's hard to keep track, honestly. I don't write these things down.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four weeks of intermittent fevers, mostly in the evenings. I understand it’s difficult to keep track without notes. And when you have a fever, do you notice any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. I get kinda achy, you know? Like a bad flu. And tired. Real tired. Not just regular tired, but… wiped out. Sometimes a little bit of a cough, but not always. No chills, though. Definitely no chills. And no… rash or anything like that. Just the aches and the tiredness mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, aches and significant fatigue accompanying the fevers, and occasionally a cough. No chills or rash. Good to know. Have you been checking your temperature when you feel these fevers coming on?
PATIENT: Yeah, I do. Old-fashioned thermometer, under the tongue. Gets up to around 101, 102, I think. Not super high, but enough to make me feel lousy. My wife makes me take it, mostly. She worries. I don't really bother unless she tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, temperatures reaching 101-102°F. That’s helpful. And your wife is looking out for you, that’s good. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Same routine, same food... Oh! We went to visit my daughter in Florida last month. That was… a change. Hot and humid, very different from here. But that was a few weeks ago, before the fevers got really bad. I didn't get sick in Florida, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, a trip to Florida last month. And you didn’t feel ill while you were there. I'm just trying to think of any potential exposures. Do you have any underlying medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Doctor says I'm pretty healthy for my age. A little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s it. I walk every day, keeps it moving. And no, I don't take any regular medicines. Just… over-the-counter stuff for the aches when I need it. Ibuprofen, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history besides some arthritis in the knees, and you manage it with walking and occasional ibuprofen. That’s good. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when she gets a new prescription for me, but the doctor says I'm good. I just don't take much, see? Makes it hard to have an allergy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point! Alright, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I retired a few years back, I used to be a chiropractor. Now I mostly garden, walk the dog, spend time with my wife and grandkids. Regular guy stuff. We eat pretty healthy, mostly. My wife does all the cooking. I drink… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy. And I don't smoke. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, retired chiropractor, active lifestyle with gardening and walking, healthy diet, occasional wine, and no smoking. That’s all good information. Just one more question for now, Mr. Brege. Have you been exposed to any sick people recently, or have you traveled anywhere else besides Florida in the last few months?
PATIENT: No, not really. My grandkids had a little cold last month, but I tried to stay away from 'em when they were sniffly. Other than that, no. And Florida was the only trip. Stayed pretty close to home, mostly. Like I said, regular guy stuff. I'm starting to feel a little rushed, if you don't mind me saying so. Is this getting us somewhere?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize if I'm taking too long. I just want to get a complete picture. You've been very helpful. Okay, so intermittent fevers for 3-4 weeks, mostly in the evenings, accompanied by aches and fatigue, occasional cough, no chills or rash. Temperatures around 101-102°F. No significant medical history, allergies, or recent travel besides a trip to Florida. Active lifestyle. I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your lungs and heart, check your abdomen, and feel for any swollen lymph nodes. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… please be quick. My wife is expecting me back. And I promised to help her with the tomatoes. A little listenin' and feelin' is alright. Just don't poke around too much, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, lungs are clear, heart sounds normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your fevers. It could be a viral infection, though the intermittent nature is a little unusual. There are also other possibilities we need to consider. I'd like to order a few blood tests just to be on the safe side. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for inflammatory markers. We can also check for some common viral infections. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… ugh. Fine. If you think it's necessary. I don't like needles, you know. And my wife will kill me if I'm late for the tomatoes. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I have to come back here? I really don't want to make another trip.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It's just to rule things out and make sure we're on the right track. The blood tests shouldn't take long - just a few minutes. And getting the results usually takes about 3-5 business days. We can call you with the results, or you can schedule a quick follow-up appointment if you prefer. We can also discuss options for managing your symptoms while we wait for the results. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103°F, or if you develop any new symptoms like a severe headache, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Call me. Don't make me come back. And… 3-5 days, you said? Okay. As long as it's not longer than that. I need to get back to the tomatoes. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you tryin’ to figure this out. Now, where do I go for the blood work? And can I eat before? My wife made breakfast.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brege. I’ll do my best to get those results back to you quickly. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. And yes, you can eat breakfast. There's no need to fast for these tests. Here’s the form for the lab technician. Just take this to the front desk, and they'll direct you to room 102. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Again, my number is on the form. Now, you go get back to those tomatoes! And tell your wife I said hello.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you not makin’ me sit around all day. Tomatoes are countin’ on me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brege. Get well soon! .
