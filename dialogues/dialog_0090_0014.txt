DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My wife, she does most of the remembering, you know? But… something about paperwork? For, uh… time off? Or maybe… if I can’t work for a bit? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. She said I needed to get something signed. Something about… FMLA? Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: FMLA, yes. That's the Family and Medical Leave Act. It allows eligible employees unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons. So, it sounds like you’re needing leave for a health reason. Before we get to paperwork, let's talk about why you might need this leave. What’s been going on with your health, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s hard to say exactly. Things just… aren't what they used to be, you know? I get tired very easily. And my memory… well, you’ve already noticed that, haven’t you? It’s not like forgetting where I put my keys, Doctor. It’s… bigger than that. I just feel… foggy. And sometimes, a bit unsteady on my feet. It’s been going on for… a while now, I suppose. Months, definitely. My wife keeps saying I need to slow down, but… I have responsibilities at the church, you see.
DOCTOR: Months… Okay. And this "fog," as you describe it, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days are better than others. But it's been getting… more frequent, lately. Like… a heavier fog, if that makes sense. And it seems to be worse in the afternoons. I try to push through it, but then I get worried about… well, about not being quite right when I’m leading things at the church. It’s… important to me, you see. I don’t want to… stumble over my words or forget what I’m saying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you’re aware of these changes. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says I've been… more irritable, maybe? Not intentionally, she says. Just… quicker to frustration. And… oh, sometimes my hands tremble a little. Not all the time, but when I’m trying to do something precise, like… writing notes for my sermons, or fixing something around the house. And… this is going to sound strange, but sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Like, they're on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't get them out. It's frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Irritability, tremors, difficulty with word-finding… All right. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. My appetite… hasn't been great, I suppose. I'm not really hungry like I used to be. My wife has been trying to get me to eat more, but… it's just not the same. And I think I've lost a bit of weight. Not a lot, but my clothes feel… looser, you know? I haven't been weighing myself regularly, though. My wife does, and she mentioned it the other day, but I don’t recall the exact number. It's probably not anything to worry about, though. Just getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Getting older, perhaps, but we still need to investigate. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia years ago, when I was living in Tahiti. That was… quite serious. And… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I’ve always tried to stay active, you know? Walked every day, ate a good diet… well, relatively good. My wife would tell you I have a sweet tooth, though. I don’t think I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything… serious. Nothing long-term, anyway.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries other than the appendix removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… No, I don't believe so. Nothing else that I recall. I did have a bad fall a few years back, when I was helping my son with some repairs on the roof. Broke my wrist, I think. But that wasn't a surgery, just a cast. I was a bit clumsy, you see. Always been a bit of a klutz. But nothing… major. No surgeries besides the appendix.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she lived to be a good age, but she had some trouble with her… her memory, towards the end. Not as bad as me, but she did forget things. My father, he was a strong man, but he had some heart trouble when he got older. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. And his wife… she had arthritis, very bad. It's hard to remember everything, you see. I wasn’t very close to my brother, unfortunately. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. I think it's… Lisinopril? Or something like that. It's a small white pill. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. Just the blood pressure pill, mostly. Here, let me show you. It's right here.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, yes. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of food, I'm not picky at all. And I've never had any trouble with… pollen, or dust, or anything like that. My wife always jokes that I'm a very resilient man. I guess I'm just lucky. Or maybe it's just good genetics. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I'm not a fan of hospitals or doctors, to be honest, but I understand it's necessary. Just… try to be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Breathing normally for me. Heart sounds… slightly diminished, but no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, let’s take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. There you go. A little wobbly, but I can hold them out. My hands… they tremble a bit sometimes, you know? It’s not constant, but… it’s there. Especially when I’m nervous, like right now. What do you think? Am I falling apart, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished, but symmetrical. Strength… a bit weak in both hands, but within normal limits. Coordination… slightly impaired. Now, I’m going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you’re able. I notice a slight unsteadiness in your gait. It’s subtle, but it's there. And I see a tremor in your hands when you walk. Now, sit back down. All right. I’m going to need to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. And I’d also like to schedule an MRI of your brain, just to get a clearer picture of things. It’s important to understand what’s going on, Mr. Limtiaco.
PATIENT: Oh. An MRI? That sounds… serious. Blood work, that’s alright, I suppose. But an MRI… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? My wife… she’s going to worry terribly. I just… I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. And I certainly don’t want to lose my ability to… to lead at the church. It's all I have left, really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, it’s understandable that you’re worried. An MRI is a very sensitive imaging test, and it allows us to see the brain in great detail. We’re looking for a number of things, such as any signs of stroke, tumors, or other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is wrong, but it's important to rule things out. Your symptoms – the fatigue, memory loss, tremors, difficulty with word-finding – they could be caused by a variety of things. We need to get more information before we can determine the exact cause. I will be honest with you, Mr. Limtiaco, these symptoms are concerning and warrant further investigation. It's possible it's something manageable, or even something relatively benign. But we need to find out. I will be with you every step of the way. And I understand how important your role at the church is to you. We will do everything we can to help you maintain your quality of life. Now, let's schedule those tests. And I will order a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail, or would you prefer your wife to be present when we discuss them?
PATIENT: Oh… a neurologist. That sounds… even more serious. Yes, please. Could we… could we schedule the tests as soon as possible? And… yes, please. I think my wife should be present. She… she remembers things better than I do. She’ll want to know all the details. And… she’ll ask the right questions. I tend to… get flustered easily. Just… please, don’t tell her anything too alarming before we have the results. She worries enough as it is. And… could you also please write a note for my church? Just… explaining that I might be taking some time off for medical reasons. I don’t want to cause any unnecessary panic.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. I will schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, first thing. And I will get the MRI scheduled as quickly as possible – likely within the next week. I will also draft a note for your church explaining your need for medical leave, without going into any specific details. And I will absolutely respect your wife’s need to be informed. We can discuss the test results together, and I will answer any questions she may have. It’s important to remember that we’re taking these steps to understand what’s going on and to get you the best possible care. We’re not jumping to any conclusions. Now, let me get some information about your medications again, just to be sure. And then we’ll schedule those appointments. We’ll take this one step at a time. I'm here to help you through this, Mr. Limtiaco.
