DOCTOR: Right. Jase Nahrwold, 20 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s… my stomach, mostly. It’s been, well, not good. Lots of… going to the bathroom. A lot. It’s been happening for a while now, I think. It's hard to remember exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Yes, well, those are helpful details. Okay. And when you say “not good,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. Okay. It’s… diarrhea. A lot of it. And it’s… watery, usually. Sometimes there’s, um, other stuff, but mostly just watery. It’s just… frequent. Really frequent. I have to keep running to the bathroom. It’s… embarrassing, honestly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Frequent watery stools. Yes. And how many times would you say "frequent" is?
PATIENT: Oh gosh. Um… let me think. It feels like… more than normal? I don’t know what “normal” is, really. Before… well, before this started, I didn’t really think about it, you know? Maybe… six or seven times a day? Sometimes more. It really depends. And it wakes me up at night sometimes, which is… not fun.
DOCTOR: Six or seven times daily?
PATIENT: Yeah. It's… a lot, right? I feel really tired all the time, too. And… my husband gets worried. He keeps asking if I'm okay. I just… I don't know what's wrong. I feel bad for him having to worry. He made me come in today, actually. I kept putting it off. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Your husband's concern is… noted. Alright. Let's try to be systematic. Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes my stomach feels a bit… crampy. Not like, really bad pain, just… uncomfortable. And maybe a little bit of nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. No fever that I’ve noticed. I usually just feel really weak and tired, like I said. It’s hard to tell what’s from the… bathroom stuff and what’s just… being tired. I’m not sure that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Not sure that makes sense.” Right. Let’s move on. Any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes to my diet… hmm. Not really, I don’t think? We eat pretty much the same things. My husband does most of the cooking, and he hasn’t changed anything. I mean, sometimes we try new recipes, but nothing major. I haven’t been eating anything different that I can think of. I've been trying to avoid anything too spicy, because I figured that might make it worse, but that was after it started, not before. I’m really bad at remembering things like that, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any travel history?
PATIENT: Travel? Not recently, no. I haven’t left the city in… a long time. Maybe a couple of trips to visit family a few years ago, but nothing in the last year or so. I don’t really… travel much. I haven't been anywhere that would have, like, weird food or anything. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: Any known allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I mean, my husband says I get a bit sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just normal, right? Not a real allergy. He gets really worried about everything, you see. I don’t think I've ever had a proper allergic reaction to food or anything like that, no.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the usual stuff sometimes, like pain relievers for headaches, but nothing regularly. My doctor… well, I don't really see a doctor often. I usually just try to rest when I'm feeling sick. My husband wanted me to come in now because it's been going on so long. He's very… proactive. Does that help? I’m sorry, I’m probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Is… is this going to be uncomfortable? I just… I don't really like doctors. And I'm a bit embarrassed, to be honest. But… I'll do it.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be. Just lie flat, and I’ll listen. Normal bowel sounds, though slightly hyperactive. No bruits or murmurs detected. Abdomen is soft, but tender to palpation in the lower quadrants…mildly. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Alright. I'll need a stool sample. There are collection containers in the bathroom.
PATIENT: A stool sample… oh. Right. Okay. That’s… great. I’ll… I’ll go do that now. Where exactly is the bathroom? And is there anything special I need to do? I’m really bad at these things, I’m sorry. I hope it doesn't take too long… and I hope it’s not… too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. Instructions are on the counter. And please, don't apologize. Just… get the sample. We'll review the results when it's available.
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Down the hall… first door. I’ll… I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: .
