DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll be brief. My throat… it hurts. Has been hurting for a few days now. Just…sore. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. But to ensure I understand the situation fully and can provide the best care, a little more detail would be helpful. When did the sore throat start exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really remember exactly. A few days, like I said. Maybe… Tuesday? Or was it Wednesday? It all feels the same, you know? Things… blur. I’ve got a lot on my mind. It’s just a sore throat, Doctor. People get them.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you aren't precise with the dates. A few days is enough to start with. And you’re right, sore throats are common. Has the soreness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Maybe a little better in the morning, but by the afternoon, it’s definitely there. Like… sandpaper. That's the best way I can explain it. And… it’s uncomfortable to swallow. Everything feels scratchy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. The sandpaper feeling and the discomfort when swallowing are important details. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sore throat, such as a fever, cough, runny nose, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever? I… don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. I don’t get fevers. Cough? Not really. Maybe a little tickle sometimes, but it’s nothing. Runny nose… perhaps. I always have a little sniffle, to be honest. Old age, I suppose. Body aches? No. I just feel… tired. But I’m always tired. Is this going somewhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. Ottaviani. We’re building a picture. The lack of fever and significant cough is good. And it's helpful to know you generally feel tired, as that gives me context. Now, have you noticed any white spots or redness in the back of your throat?
PATIENT: White spots? Redness? Look, I haven’t been looking in my throat. I don’t have those little…tools, you know? The ones people use. And frankly, I don’t want to see. It’ll just upset me. I just want something to make it stop hurting, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s absolutely not too much to ask. We’ll get to that. It would be very helpful if I could just take a quick look at your throat to get a better idea of what’s going on. It will only take a moment. Then we can discuss treatment options. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And please, don't make a mess. I don’t like doctors poking around. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a little swollen, but no obvious white spots or pus. There isn't significant swelling that would make me immediately concerned about breathing difficulties. Your uvula appears normal. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it sounds like you likely have a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, to rule out a bacterial infection like strep throat, which requires antibiotics, I'd like to perform a quick strep test. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Strep test? More poking? Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I just have a sore throat. I've had worse. I don’t need tests. I need something for the pain. That’s all. Can you just…give me something? I don’t have time for all of this. And I certainly don’t want to pay for all of this… poking and prodding. I’m a widow, you know. I have to be careful with my money. Just give me a lozenge and send me on my way. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your concerns about cost, Ms. Ottaviani. I certainly don't want to add to your stress. And you are right, a simple sore throat often resolves on its own. However, strep throat can lead to serious complications if left untreated, such as rheumatic fever. The test is a quick swab, and it will give us a definitive answer. It’s a very small cost to rule out something potentially serious. If you are truly opposed to the test, we can proceed without it. However, if it is strep throat, antibiotics are necessary. If we don’t treat it, and your symptoms worsen – develop a high fever, difficulty swallowing, or a rash – you would need to come back, and the treatment would likely be more extensive. Would you prefer I explain the test in more detail, or perhaps we can discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options and monitor your symptoms closely for the next few days?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The test, whatever. But make it quick. And don't tell me any more about…complications. I don’t need to hear it. I’m a grown woman. I’ve lived a long life. If I get sick, I get sick. Just…do it. And then give me something to make the pain stop. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. This will take just a moment. Open wide, and say “ahhh.” There. All done. Now, we’ll wait a few minutes for the results. While we wait, can you tell me about any allergies you may have to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I haven't paid much attention to that sort of thing. I take what the pharmacist gives me. Never had a problem, really. I used to be able to take anything… but I’m getting older. Everything’s different now. I think… maybe I had a reaction to something once, a long time ago. But I can't recall exactly what. It wasn’t serious. Just a little…itchy. Is that important, Doctor? Really? Because I’m starting to feel a bit faint. All this… poking and prodding. It’s too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s good to know you haven't had any serious reactions. And it’s alright if you can’t recall specifics. The itchy reaction is helpful to know, though. We’ll be cautious. Alright, Ms. Ottaviani, the results are back. The strep test is negative. That means your sore throat is likely caused by a virus. There’s no need for antibiotics. We can manage your symptoms with supportive care. I'm going to recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as directed on the label. Gargling with warm salt water several times a day can also provide some relief. And most importantly, get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Rest and fluids. Pain relievers. I know, I know. Old wives’ tales. Look, Doctor, can we just be done here? I really need to go. I have… things to attend to. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite unwell. This whole experience has been… draining. Just… a prescription for something stronger, perhaps? Something to really knock this out? I don’t want to be sick for days. I don’t have time for that. And please, don’t lecture me about antibiotics. I understand the risks. I just want to feel better. Now. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. I truly do. However, prescribing antibiotics when they aren’t needed won’t help your viral infection and can actually contribute to antibiotic resistance, making them less effective when they are truly needed. Since your test is negative and your symptoms are consistent with a viral pharyngitis, the best course of action is supportive care as I mentioned. I can, however, offer a prescription for a stronger throat lozenge with a local anesthetic to help manage the pain and discomfort. It won’t cure the infection, but it may provide some temporary relief. Would that be acceptable?
