DOCTOR: Right. Airam Fontanazza, 33 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… the lady on the phone said something about… learning? I don't really remember. It’s about… being healthy, I think. My husband, he said I should come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: “Learning about being healthy,” right. And your husband encouraged this visit?
PATIENT: Yes. He says I don’t… take care of myself. Always eating… well, you know. He’s always on my case about it. It’s not like I feel sick. Just… bigger, maybe? It's not a big deal. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “Bigger,” alright. And has this been a gradual change, or more sudden?
PATIENT: Sudden? Not really. It’s… been a while. Years, probably. I don't keep track of things like that. It just… happened. I have a busy life. Sheet metal work is hard, you know? Lots of lifting.
DOCTOR: Sheet metal work. Physically demanding, yes. And how long have you been doing this work?
PATIENT: About… ten years, I think? Maybe eleven. It’s good money. My husband… he used to say I shouldn’t do such a rough job, but we needed the money. He doesn’t say that anymore. He just… sighs a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the weight, have you noticed any other changes in your body?
PATIENT: Changes? Um… I get… tired. More tired than before, maybe. And my hands… they ache sometimes. Especially after a long day at work. But everyone aches, right? It's just… old age, probably. I’m not that young anymore.
DOCTOR: “Old age”?
PATIENT: Well, 33 isn’t exactly spring chicken, is it? My mother always said… never mind. It doesn't matter. It's just… I work hard. My hands hurt, I get tired. That's it. No big deal. Are we done now? I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Let's try to be a bit more thorough, shall we?
PATIENT: Thorough about what? I told you, I'm just… bigger. And tired. What else do you need to know? I don't understand why this is taking so long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of… what? You mean… like, when I run? I don't really run. Too much effort. I get a little winded sometimes, climbing stairs… but who doesn't? It's just… being out of shape. This job isn't exactly a walk in the park, you know.
DOCTOR: And how about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? I eat. What kind of question is that? My husband tries to get me to eat… salads and things. But they’re not very filling. I like noodles. And… dumplings. And sometimes… fried chicken. We have a takeout place nearby. It’s good. I eat what I like. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any family history of… heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? My grandmother… on my mother’s side… she was sick. Very sick. But I don't know what she was sick with. Old people get sick, right? It was a long time ago. We didn’t have good doctors back then. I don't really keep track of things like that. It's all very… distant.
DOCTOR: We’re going to need to do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs… just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Examine me? For what? I told you, I’m just… bigger. And tired. Are you saying I’m sick? My husband is going to be so annoyed if I'm sick. He already worries too much. I don't like doctors poking around. It's… undignified.
DOCTOR: It's not about assuming you're sick, Ms. Fontanazza. It's about gathering information. A basic exam helps me understand your overall health. It’s standard procedure. Now, if you’ll just allow me to listen to your heart and lungs… it will only take a moment. Please, sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine. But if you find anything, don’t tell my husband. He’ll make me eat nothing but… kale. Hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and hold it… good. Now exhale. Again… deep breath… and exhale. Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. Heart rate is a bit fast as well, 98 beats per minute. Lungs sound… slightly congested. Ms. Fontanazza, your blood pressure is quite high. This, combined with your weight and the slight congestion in your lungs, is concerning. We need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. A blood panel, an EKG… and possibly a chest X-ray. It's important to rule out any underlying health issues.
PATIENT: Tests? X-rays? What do you mean, "rule out health issues"? Are you saying I'm… dying? My husband is going to kill me if I have to go through all that. And the money! Tests are expensive! No. I don't want any tests. I just want to go home. I'm fine. I just need a nap. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, please sit down. We’re not talking about “dying.” But ignoring these warning signs could lead to serious health problems down the line. High blood pressure is often called the “silent killer” because it doesn’t always have noticeable symptoms until it’s too late. We can discuss payment options. Many clinics offer financial assistance programs. And we can prioritize the most essential tests first. But we need to investigate this further. I’m recommending a blood panel to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar. And an EKG to assess your heart health. And, yes, a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues. This isn’t about scaring you, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s about being proactive and ensuring your long-term health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. But promise me you won’t tell my husband. He’ll fuss over me for months. And he’ll make me eat… tofu. But… what if it’s something bad? What if I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery. I have work to do. And I just want to be left alone. Just… tell me if it’s really bad, okay? Don’t sugarcoat it, but… don’t make me feel worse than I already do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand your concerns. I promise, I will be honest with you, and I will do my best to explain everything in a way you understand. We'll take things one step at a time. First, we get the tests done. Then, we review the results, and we discuss the best course of action. It's important to remember that many of these issues are manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. And, while surgery is always a possibility, it’s not always necessary. We will explore all options before making any decisions. Let's get the lab order for the blood panel and the request for the EKG and chest X-ray. I'll have my nurse draw your blood now, and then she can schedule the imaging for you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… not right now. Just… hurry up. I don't like being in hospitals. And don't tell my husband. Please. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll send the nurse in right away. And I assure you, Ms. Fontanazza, we will proceed as quickly and efficiently as possible. .
