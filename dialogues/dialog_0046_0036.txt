DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, it is a pleasure. I am here… for the check-up before the insurance starts, you understand? Medicare wants this, I believe. It is… necessary paperwork, no?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A welcome-to-Medicare physical is quite common, and a good way to establish a baseline for your health. Necessary paperwork is a good way to put it. So, this is primarily for the insurance requirement, but we can certainly use this time to address any health concerns you may have as well. Let's start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been generally healthy, or have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant…? I have not been sick sick. A few colds, of course. Everyone gets colds. And once, I fell from a ladder when I was fixing the roof, but it was not so bad. Just a scrape. My mother, she had… problems with her stomach. Old age, I think. But me? I work hard. I eat… food. I am healthy enough, I believe. What kind of information do you need, exactly?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. “Not sick sick” is a good way to put it! When I ask about significant illnesses, I'm thinking about things that required hospital stays, chronic conditions like diabetes or heart problems, or anything that might need ongoing management. Since you mentioned your mother, do you know what specifically her stomach problems were?
PATIENT: Hospital… no, she did not go to the hospital. The doctor came to her house. Old age, like I said. Always complaining of pain. She took many pills. Yellow pills, mostly. I do not know the name of the problem. She just… stopped eating, then she… was gone. It was very sad. I do not like talking about this. Is this important for the insurance? I can give you a list of the pills if that helps.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult to talk about, and you don't need to share anything you're not comfortable with, Mr. Barban. Knowing about your mother's issues can be helpful, as certain conditions can have a genetic component, but it’s certainly not required for the insurance paperwork. Let's focus on you. Do you currently have any health conditions – things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No. I do not have anything. I told you, I work hard. I lift heavy things at the factory all day. If I had something wrong, I would know. My body is strong. The only thing is… sometimes my back hurts a little. After lifting, you understand. But it goes away. It is just… work. Is this what you want to know about? Pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good information. It’s important to know about any pain you experience, even if it’s related to work. Back pain is very common, especially with a physically demanding job. So, the back pain comes on after lifting heavy things at the factory, and then it resolves?
PATIENT: Yes. Exactly. It is not… constant. It comes and goes. It is like a muscle, tired from working too hard. I rub it, and it feels better. Sometimes I take… a yellow pill. For the pain, you understand. But not often. Only when it is… really bad. The kind you buy at the store, not a doctor's pill. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important to know about any medications you're taking, even over-the-counter ones. What's the name of the yellow pill you take for the pain?
PATIENT: Ah. I do not… remember the name. It is in a little white bottle. It says… "Pain Reliever". A big word. It has… numbers on it too. 200 milligrams, I think? I buy it at the… drugstore. Near the factory. It is the cheap one. I do not need the expensive pills. I am not a… delicate man. Is this enough information? I really do not pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. "Pain Reliever" with 200 milligrams on the bottle – that gives me a good starting point. We'll want to discuss using pain relievers regularly, even over-the-counter ones, as they can sometimes have side effects. Now, aside from the back pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. I feel… tired, sometimes. But that is from working too much. Everyone feels tired. I sleep, and I am better. My wife… she says I snore very loud. She sleeps in the other room. But that is not a… symptom. It is just… me. I do not understand what kind of symptoms you are looking for. What do you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. By symptoms, I mean anything different than your usual state of health. Anything bothering you – like changes in your weight, appetite, energy level, sleep patterns, bowel habits, or anything else unusual. For example, have you noticed any fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. I eat too much, if anything! My wife is always telling me to eat less. Energy level… well, I am tired after work, but that is normal. Bowel… habits? I do not want to talk about that. This is… personal. No, nothing is different. I am just a man who works hard and gets tired. Is this enough? I have been answering questions for a long time now. Is the insurance check-up almost finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, you've provided a lot of helpful information, Mr. Barban, and we're almost finished with the initial questions. I apologize if I've asked anything too personal – I just want to make sure I have a complete picture of your health. To finish up, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pain reliever, like vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat food. That is enough. I do not trust those… pills. My father took many pills when he was old, and it did not help him. He just… got worse. No, I do not take anything else. Can we be finished now? I have to get back to work. My shift starts soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Barban. We are finished with the questions. Before you go, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we can discuss the next steps for the insurance paperwork and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? You mean… touch me? I do not understand. I am a grown man. Is this necessary for the insurance? I do not like being touched. Can we just… sign the paperwork? I really need to get back to work. My boss… he does not like people being late. I do not want any trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Barban, and I apologize if I made you feel uneasy. The physical exam is a standard part of a welcome-to-Medicare physical and is often required by insurance. It's a quick assessment to get a baseline of your health – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your overall well-being. I will explain everything I'm doing before I do it, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. It is important for establishing your health baseline. We can focus on the vital signs – blood pressure and pulse – if that makes you more comfortable, and skip the rest of the exam for now. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Just… the blood pressure? And the… pulse? No touching? Just… the machine? Yes. That I can do. As long as you do not… touch me. My wife will be angry if I am late. She is very strict. But the blood pressure machine… that is okay. Is it fast? I have a shift to get to.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, just the blood pressure and pulse is perfectly fine. It will be very quick – just a few minutes. We'll start with the blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Just… do it fast. And do not… hurt me. My arm is strong from lifting.
DOCTOR: I will be as quick and gentle as possible, Mr. Barban. This might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t hurt. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular. Everything seems within a normal range. Okay, that completes the brief physical assessment. Now, let’s discuss the paperwork required by Medicare. We’ll need to fill out a health history form and sign a consent form. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Forms…? More paperwork? I do not understand these things. My wife usually fills out the paperwork. She is very good at this. Can I just… sign whatever you tell me to sign? I really have to go. My shift… it starts very soon. And my boss… he gets angry easily.
DOCTOR: I understand your situation, Mr. Barban. However, I am ethically obligated to ensure you understand what you are signing. I cannot simply ask you to sign without explaining the documents. Perhaps we can focus on the key information on each form, and I can highlight the important sections for you. It won’t take too long, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have, no matter how small. If that’s still too much, and you prefer your wife to review the forms later, we can schedule another appointment for that purpose. We can print them out for you to take home. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Print them out… for my wife? Yes. That is acceptable. I just… I need to go now. My shift. She will be angry. Just… print the forms, and I will give them to her. She knows these things. Is that okay? I do not want to cause trouble. Can I leave now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Mr. Barban. I will print out the necessary forms for your wife to review. Here you are. These include the health history questionnaire, a consent form for treatment, and a form to confirm your insurance details. I appreciate your patience today. If you have any questions or concerns after your wife reviews the forms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic, and we’ll be happy to assist you. You can go ahead and get back to work now. Drive safely.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. I must go now. My boss… he is waiting. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Barban. Have a good shift. And please tell your wife to call if she has any questions.
