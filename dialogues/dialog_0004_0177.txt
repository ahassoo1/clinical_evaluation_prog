DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Genard. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Doctor... Deschane, right? Yes. Well, it's... it's a problem. A delicate problem. Down there. It's...leaking. I don't know what else to call it. Not nice, let me tell ya. And it’s been happening for… a while now, I guess. I don’t really keep track of dates, you know? Old lady problems.
DOCTOR: "Old lady problems," alright. Well, we can certainly address this. When you say “leaking,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, geez. How specific does a doctor need to be? It's...it's wet. And kinda smelly. Not a good smell, I assure you. It's coming from… well, there. From the man part. Though, I don't have a man part, obviously! It's just… what my mama used to call it. It's not right, and it's making things uncomfortable. Especially after...well, you know. Business. If you get my drift. Though I haven't had much business lately.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're experiencing involuntary leakage of fluid from the vaginal area, accompanied by an odor, and it’s worsened after bowel movements. Has this been a sudden onset, or has it gradually become worse over time?
PATIENT: Oh, you use such fancy words. “Involuntary leakage”? Goodness. Well, it wasn’t sudden, no. It… crept up on me, I suppose. A little drip here, a little drip there. I thought maybe it was just old age, you know? Things falling apart. I didn’t pay much attention at first. But then the smell… that’s when I knew somethin’ was really wrong. It's been…worse these last few months, definitely. Not a sudden thing, but definitely not getting better. Though, honestly, I can't remember exactly when it started. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this leakage affected your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. It’s… embarrassing. I don’t go out much as it is, but now… even going to the store is a worry. Gotta wear dark pants, you know? And always, always have extra underwear. And the smell… I worry people can tell. I try not to sit too long, but… old bones, you know? Gotta rest. It’s just… it’s a nuisance, really. A very smelly, embarrassing nuisance. I used to be so… neat. Everything always clean. Now? Not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the leakage and odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… well, there’s a little… burning sometimes. When I… you know. Go to the bathroom. And it feels kinda itchy, down there. Not all the time, but sometimes. And… I don't know if this matters, but… everything just feels kinda… sore. Like I’ve been rubbed raw. Not painful, exactly, but… tender. And I’ve been more tired lately, but who isn’t tired at my age, right? It's hard to tell what's from the… leakage, and what's just… old lady stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, burning with urination, occasional itching, and a general soreness in the vaginal area, in addition to the leakage and odor. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes in… what now? Bowel habits? You’re askin’ a lot of personal questions, Doctor. Well… I go to the bathroom. Same as always. Maybe a little more often, now that I think of it. Gotta run to the little girls’ room a lot quicker, if you know what I mean. And… it's not as… solid as it used to be. More… loose. But everyone gets a little loose sometimes, right? Especially when they eat somethin’ bad. It’s probably just the food. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to all that stuff. It goes in, it comes out. What’s there to talk about?
DOCTOR: Right. So, increased frequency and looser stools. Now, I'm going to need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… Well, I had a bad case of the flu when I was a little girl. Nearly died, Mama always said. And I broke my arm when I was… oh, I don't know, maybe ten? Aside from that… I think I was always just a healthy girl. Never really needed a doctor much. I took some pills for my water once, when I was swollen like a balloon. But that was ages ago. I don’t remember what they were for, or if they even helped. I just remember Mama fussin’ over me. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. Just an old lady with a leaky problem. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm... let me think. Well, I had my tonsils taken out when I was a little girl. That was awful, Mama said it was the worst. And... oh! I had a growth removed from my leg, a long time ago. A funny little bump, the doctor said it was nothing to worry about. That was… maybe fifty years ago? Aside from that, no. I've always been lucky, I guess. Never needed any fancy operations. Just a little snip here and there. Nothing serious. Definitely nothin' serious. Why are you askin' all these questions? It's just a leaky problem, right? You don’t need to know my life story for a leaky problem.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? My mama… she’s gone now, passed away years ago. A good woman, a strong woman. I had a brother, but he moved away a long time ago. Don’t hear from him much. And I had a husband… gone now too, a long, long time ago. We didn’t have any children. Just me. Not much of a family left, really. Just old memories. Why are you askin' about my family? It doesn’t have nothin' to do with the leaky problem, does it? It's just a thing, right? A medical thing?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I'm asking about your medical and family history to get a complete picture of your overall health. It’s important. Now, I need to ask about allergies and current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Never had any problems with food, never had a bad reaction to a pill. I used to get stung by bees when I was little, but that was just a little pain. Didn’t even need a doctor, Mama just put some mud on it. As for medications… I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Just a little pain reliever sometimes, for my aches and pains. But that’s it. Just a little somethin' over the counter. Nothing fancy. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty simple woman. I don’t need a lot of pills, and I don’t get sick much. It’s just the leaky problem. Is that all we’re gonna talk about? I’m getting tired now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, and we’ll start with an abdominal exam and then a pelvic exam. I'll explain everything as I go, and please, let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… a what exam? Oh, goodness, no. No, no, no. Not that exam. I’m too old for that exam. I’ve had enough poking and prodding in my life, thank you very much. Just tell me what’s wrong with my leaky problem. Can’t you just give me a pill or somethin’? I don’t need an exam. I just want it fixed. I don't want anyone… lookin’ down there. I’m an old lady, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Just give me a pill. Please.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Genard, I understand your discomfort, but a physical exam is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide the appropriate treatment. I cannot simply prescribe a “pill” without knowing what we're dealing with. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, it could be something more serious. I assure you, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. If you absolutely refuse, I can refer you to another physician, but I strongly recommend allowing me to perform a basic exam. The pelvic exam will allow me to visualize the area and assess the source of the leakage and odor. I will explain everything beforehand and stop immediately if you feel uncomfortable. Refusing an examination could delay a proper diagnosis and potentially worsen your condition. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re makin’ me nervous, Doctor. All this talk of… worsenin’ and delayin’… I… I don’t like the sound of any of this. But… if you have to poke and prod… then I guess you can. But be quick, okay? And gentle. Very gentle. And tell me everything you’re doin’ before you do it. Don’t just… surprise me. And if it hurts, I’m stoppin’ you right then and there. You hear me? I’m an old lady, I don’t have much patience for pain. And… maybe you can just look? Don’t stick anything in there, if you can help it. Just… be careful. Okay? Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I will explain every step of the process before I do it. We can start with an abdominal exam, just to get a feel for things. Then, we can proceed to the pelvic exam. I will use a speculum, but we can start without it if you prefer. And if at any point you feel uncomfortable, we will stop immediately. If you are ready, please lie down on your back, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I will drape you with a sheet for privacy and dignity. I'll be right back with the drape and some lubricant. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… get it over with quickly. And… don’t look surprised by anything, okay? I'm an old lady. Things aren’t always what they used to be. Just… hurry. And please, be gentle. Very, very gentle. And explain everything. Every single thing. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I'm going to gently drape you with this sheet, leaving only the abdominal area exposed initially. We’ll start with an abdominal exam to listen to your bowel sounds and check for any tenderness. Then, I'll ask you to relax, and I'll perform a pelvic exam. I will use a speculum to visualize the vagina and cervix. I’ll explain the purpose of each step as I go. I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen first, just feeling for any areas of discomfort. It might feel a little bit like pressing on your stomach. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay... okay. Just... don't poke too hard. And tell me what you're doing before you touch me, okay? Be careful... just... be careful. And... hurry. I don't like being touched. Just... get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I'm now going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting on your right side. This means I'll be using my hands to lightly press on different areas of your stomach to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. It shouldn't be painful, but please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. I'm just feeling for any areas that are tender or swollen. I'm not finding anything unusual so far. Is this okay?
PATIENT: It's... okay. Just... don't press too hard. It's a little sensitive, but it's okay. Just... hurry. This is making me nervous. Just... get it over with. Don't find anything bad, okay? Just... tell me when it's over.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. Now I’m moving to your left side. I'm just checking for any areas of tenderness. I’m not finding anything concerning so far. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no obvious tenderness. Now, if you’re comfortable, we can proceed to the pelvic exam. This will allow me to visualize your vagina and cervix. Before we do that, is there anything you’d like me to know, or anything you're particularly worried about?
PATIENT: No! No… just… no. I don’t want you to… look down there. I told you. Just… stop. I’m too old for that exam. I don't want you poking around. Just… give me a pill. Anything. Just… no. I don't want to be touched down there. Please. Just stop. Please, Doctor. Just stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand. You're absolutely right to stop me if you’re uncomfortable. I apologize if I pushed you too far. I wasn't intending to cause you any distress. I completely respect your wishes. We won't proceed with the pelvic exam. I can appreciate that this is a difficult and sensitive situation. We can explore other options. Perhaps we can discuss a referral to another physician, or focus on symptom management for now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s… that’s better. Just… no more poking. No more looking. Just… a pill. Maybe a pill would help. If there is one. But… no more exams. I don’t want to be touched. Just… help me feel better. That's all I want. No more poking. Please. Just… help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand. We will absolutely focus on finding a solution that makes you comfortable. Unfortunately, without a proper examination, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms and prescribe the correct medication. However, we can discuss some options for symptom management. We can consider an antibiotic if we suspect a urinary tract infection, but it’s important to understand that this is just a temporary solution. I strongly recommend a referral to a gynecologist who specializes in sensitive care. They may be able to offer a more tailored approach and address your concerns with more compassion. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A… a gynecologist? Will they… poke too? I don't want to see another doctor who's going to touch me down there. It's just... too much. Maybe… maybe just a pill. If you think it will help. But no more doctors. No more poking. Please. Just... help me. But no more poking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. I understand your concerns completely. I will not push you to do anything you are not comfortable with. Since you are reluctant to see another physician for an examination, we can explore some over-the-counter options for symptom management. We can consider a cranberry supplement to help prevent urinary tract infections, and a soothing cream for the external irritation. However, it's important to understand that these are just temporary solutions, and they may not address the underlying cause of your symptoms. I will also provide you with some information on urinary health and hygiene, and some resources for emotional support. I strongly encourage you to consider a referral to a gynecologist at a later time, but I respect your wishes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Just… pills and cream. That’s… that’s alright. Just… no more poking. No more looking. Just… help me feel better. That’s all I want. Just… help me. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. Just… help me. Just… help me. I think I'm ready to go home now. Just… help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Genard. You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help, even if it's just with some temporary solutions. I’ll write a short note for you outlining the recommended over-the-counter options and the information on urinary health and hygiene. I'll also provide you with the resources for emotional support. Please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so kind. Just… help me feel better. Just… thank you. I think I'm ready to go home now. Just… help me. Just… please don't tell anyone about this. Just… please. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Genard. Your privacy is extremely important to me. I assure you, everything we discussed today will remain strictly confidential. I’ll have someone escort you to the exit. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
