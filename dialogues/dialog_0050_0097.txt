DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos, pleased to meet you. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Paraskevopoulos. It's…Chilla, yes. Well, my husband, he suggested I come. He’s been reading things online, you see, about…planning for things. About what happens if…well, if something should happen. He thinks I need one of those forms. An advance directive, I believe he called it. Honestly, I don’t quite understand why it's necessary, but he is quite insistent.
DOCTOR: An advance directive, yes. A prudent, if somewhat… anxious, undertaking. It’s not uncommon for spouses to encourage such planning. While you may not feel it’s necessary at this juncture, it certainly doesn't hurt to be prepared. However, simply completing a form without a thorough discussion of your wishes isn’t particularly useful. Before we proceed, let's establish a clearer picture of your overall health. To ensure this document is truly reflective of your desires, I need to understand your medical background. Have you been under the care of any physicians recently?
PATIENT: Oh, doctors. Yes, well, I have a general practitioner, of course. Dr. Moreau, back in the city. But I rarely need to see him. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, you see. Diet, exercise…it’s all very important. I suppose I had a check-up…last year? Perhaps the year before. It was all perfectly normal, as always. I really don't see the point of frequent visits when everything is functioning optimally. But I can give you his information, if you insist.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly normal,” you say. While admirable, Ms. Chilla, even those in optimal health benefit from regular monitoring. It allows us to establish a baseline and detect any subtle changes. Dr. Moreau’s information would be helpful, yes. But for the sake of a comprehensive understanding, let’s delve a little deeper. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh, goodness no. Not unless you count when I was a child, and that was…well, a very long time ago. A silly bout of tonsillitis, I believe. Perfectly routine. Nothing of any consequence whatsoever. I assure you, Doctor, I am not prone to illness. It simply isn't…becoming. My mother always said a strong constitution is a woman's greatest asset. And I’ve certainly inherited hers. Really, I find this line of questioning rather…unnecessary. Is this truly required for this form?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your robust health history, Ms. Chilla, a complete medical background is essential for accurately representing your wishes in an advance directive. It ensures the document is legally sound and reflects your true preferences, should you ever be unable to communicate them yourself. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Doctor, are you quite serious? I have never had a surgery. I maintain a very careful lifestyle, as I’ve mentioned. One avoids unnecessary interventions when one takes proper care of oneself. Honestly, this is becoming quite tedious. I came here because my husband is overly cautious, not to recount a lifetime of perfect health. Is there a shorter route to obtaining this…form? Perhaps a questionnaire?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I assure you, this questioning is not intended to be tedious, but rather thorough. An advance directive is a significant legal document. To proceed responsibly, I must establish a complete picture of your medical history. Very well. Let’s shift focus then. Could you tell me about any significant illnesses within your family?
PATIENT: Family illnesses? Honestly, Doctor, my family is remarkably healthy. My mother lived to be ninety-seven, and my father well into his eighties. They were both very…vigorous people. A bit of arthritis here and there in their later years, perhaps. But nothing…serious. No heart problems, no cancers, no… dreadful things. They attributed it to genetics, a good diet, and a generally refined lifestyle. Truly, it’s quite simple. Good breeding, you see. It makes all the difference. Is this absolutely necessary? My husband will be furious if I'm here all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your husband’s concern regarding time, Ms. Chilla. However, even within healthy families, illnesses can occur. Knowing your family history provides valuable context. Let’s try a different approach. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, really. I am perfectly fine. I eat everything in moderation, of course. I have never, ever had an allergic reaction. I suppose I’m a bit sensitive to cheap perfume, but that’s hardly a medical condition. It’s simply…unpleasant. Honestly, I find this whole process rather demeaning. I’ve lived a long, healthy life, and I don’t see the point of cataloging every minor discomfort. Are we getting any closer to this…form? My husband is expecting me back for tea.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, I am attempting to gather the necessary information to ensure this advance directive accurately reflects your wishes should you become unable to express them yourself. Dismissing potential medical concerns, no matter how minor they seem to you, is not conducive to responsible planning. To continue, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not! I pride myself on maintaining a natural state. I believe in the power of a healthy diet and regular exercise, not relying on artificial substances. A bit of chamomile tea before bed, perhaps, but that is hardly a medication. Honestly, Doctor, I find your line of questioning rather insulting. I came here to fulfill my husband's anxieties, not to be subjected to a medical interrogation. Is this “form” going to materialize at some point, or are we simply going to continue dissecting my perfectly healthy lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I understand your frustration. However, I must reiterate that completing an advance directive without a thorough understanding of your medical history is, frankly, irresponsible. It is a legal document with serious implications, and I will not compromise my professional ethics simply to expedite the process. Before we proceed any further, I need to determine if you are truly willing to engage in this process honestly and completely. If not, I recommend you seek the assistance of another physician. Now, to be perfectly clear, are you absolutely certain you are not taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Since you insist. My…friend, Madame Evangeline, she recommended a…tonic. For vitality, you see. It’s…herbal. Completely natural. I’ve been taking it…sporadically. Perhaps once a week, if that. It’s nothing substantial, honestly. Just a little boost. But honestly, Doctor, are we seriously halting this entire process over a tonic? This is becoming utterly ridiculous. Just write it down, please. “Herbal tonic, once a week.” Now, can we finally get to this form? My husband is going to be most displeased.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I must strongly advise you to disclose the complete ingredients of this “tonic” to me. Herbal remedies can interact with other medications, and their efficacy and safety are often unproven. Simply knowing it's "herbal" is insufficient. If you cannot provide a complete list of ingredients, I cannot proceed further. Additionally, I will need to document your height and weight for accurate record-keeping. If you are willing to cooperate with these basic procedures, we can continue. Otherwise, I recommend you consult with a physician who can conduct a more thorough assessment before completing this advance directive.
PATIENT: Good heavens! You want me to… weigh myself? And… be measured? Are you quite serious, Doctor? I haven’t been weighed in decades! It’s simply… uncouth. And the ingredients… Madame Evangeline’s formula is a closely guarded secret, naturally. She wouldn’t reveal it to just anyone! This is utterly preposterous! Honestly, I’ve never been so insulted in my life. I think I’ve had enough. I’ll speak to my husband. Perhaps he can find a more… accommodating physician. This entire experience has been… deeply unpleasant. .
