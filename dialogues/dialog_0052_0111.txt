DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I confess, I'm not entirely certain why I'm here. My wife insisted. Something about my…complexion. Frankly, I'm a busy man. Rebar doesn’t reinforce itself, you know. I feel…tired, and my skin seems…darker. That’s all I know. Can we make this quick?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. We will do our best to be efficient. Your wife’s concern is valuable, and even a seemingly small change like a change in complexion or increased fatigue can be important. Let’s start with the fatigue. Can you describe what you mean by “tired”?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Tired. As in, I work long hours, physical labor. It’s not a new sensation. I’ve been doing this for…well, a very long time. I simply don’t have the energy I used to, I suppose. But everyone gets old. It’s not something one requires a doctor for. Are you going to ask me about my diet next? Because honestly, Doctor, I eat what keeps me going. It's not fancy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. And you are right, fatigue can be a natural part of aging, especially with physically demanding work. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. To help me understand, could you tell me a bit more about how this fatigue is affecting your daily life?
PATIENT: Affecting my… Honestly, it means I’m less inclined to oversee things at the site. I used to be on my feet all day, now I find myself…observing. More delegation, less…doing. It’s frustrating, naturally. My men aren’t as precise as I am. Is that what you want to know? Details about my work? It feels like a waste of my time, truthfully.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. A change in your ability to perform your usual activities is important information. And no, I don’t need a detailed account of your work, just an understanding of how this fatigue is impacting you. Now, you mentioned your skin seems darker. Has this change been gradual, or did it happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I suppose. It's difficult to say precisely. I don’t spend my days examining my complexion, Doctor. My wife pointed it out. Said I looked… unwell. She’s always been overly concerned with appearances. It’s been…weeks, perhaps months. It's not as if I've been lounging in the sun, if that’s what you’re implying. I haven’t the time for such frivolous activities. Can we move on? This is all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. I assure you, I am not implying anything about sun exposure. It’s simply important to gather as much information as possible. To clarify, has there been any change in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Weight? Doctor, I eat when I’m hungry. And my weight…hasn’t anyone told you doctors aren’t supposed to ask such personal questions? It fluctuates, naturally. I'm a working man. Sometimes I eat more, sometimes less. It's hardly a medical anomaly. Look, I’m perfectly healthy, or I wouldn’t be able to run my sites. Can we please finish this? I have a schedule to maintain. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your desire to get back to your schedule, and I respect that. However, it’s my responsibility to gather enough information to ensure your well-being. Even if you feel healthy, subtle changes can indicate underlying issues. I will proceed, but I would greatly appreciate your cooperation. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
