DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I’m here about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife helped me set this up. I don’t really remember all the details, honestly. Something about getting evaluated before… before they do the surgery?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall all the specifics. We can certainly go over everything. It sounds like your wife scheduled an evaluation to see if you might be a candidate for weight loss surgery. Let’s start with a little more information about why you’re interested in surgery now. Could you tell me about your weight journey – how long you’ve been dealing with weight concerns, and what you’ve tried in the past to manage your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, man. A long time, I guess. Honestly, it feels like… always? I was bigger as a kid, and it just kinda stuck. I've tried… diets, I think. My wife always tries to get me to eat healthier, and I try, but… it’s hard. I don't remember specific diets, just… less food, more salad sometimes? And I tried walking a bit, but my knees bother me. It’s tough. I really don’t know what all I’ve done, to be honest. It feels like a lot of trying and then… giving up. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds very frustrating to have tried so many things without lasting success. It’s very common, and you're not alone in that experience. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your current daily routine?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Well, I wake up, usually around 7. I work at the store – it's a hardware store, not far from here. I work pretty much a full day, until 5 or 6. My wife usually has dinner ready when I get home, which is good. After dinner, I usually just… sit. Watch TV, maybe. I don't really do much anymore. I used to… I think I used to play soccer, a long time ago, but not for years. Weekends are pretty much the same, just more sitting. Does that make sense? I don't really have a lot of energy these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like a fairly sedentary lifestyle, which can certainly contribute to weight management challenges. You mentioned not having much energy. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that – perhaps difficulty sleeping, feeling down or depressed, or any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I do get tired really easily. And… sometimes I just don't feel like doing anything. It's not like I'm sad, exactly, but I just don't have much motivation. And my knees… they ache a lot, especially after work. And sometimes, I get… out of breath just walking up the stairs. It’s probably the weight, right? I just feel… worn out, a lot of the time. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like you're experiencing several symptoms that are common with increased weight, including fatigue, low motivation, knee pain, and shortness of breath. These are all important things to consider. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I think the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high last time I had a check-up, but it wasn't anything serious, I don’t think. Other than that… I don't really know. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. I haven't really needed to, until now. My wife usually handles all that stuff. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We can certainly work with what you remember and I have access to some records here. Your wife scheduling this appointment is very helpful. A slightly elevated blood pressure is good to know. Let me see… Okay, I see a blood pressure reading from about a year ago that was slightly elevated, as you mentioned. No other significant medical history documented. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. Just the usual colds and stuff when I was a kid. Nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was little, playing soccer, but that was a long time ago. I mostly just try to stay out of trouble, honestly. It sounds silly, but I don't really like going to the doctor. That's why I let my wife handle it.
DOCTOR: That's not silly at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly understandable to avoid the doctor if you don't enjoy it. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Does anyone in your family have diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or obesity?
PATIENT: Um… my mom, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my dad… he was a little overweight, but he didn't really take care of himself. He smoked a lot, too. My wife's side of the family… I don't really know them very well, so I don't know about their health problems. Sorry, I wish I could give you more information. I just don't really keep track of that sort of thing. Does that help at all? I know I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure and your father’s weight and smoking habits is useful information. Don’t worry about not having all the details – we're working with what you know. Finally, let’s talk about allergies and any medications you’re currently taking. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. And I don’t take any medications. Not even vitamins, or anything like that. I just… try to avoid stuff, I guess. My wife tries to get me to take vitamins, but I forget. I’m terrible with remembering stuff like that. So, no medications, no allergies. Just… me. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know, Mr. Kochubey. No allergies and no medications. So, to summarize, you've been dealing with weight concerns for a long time, you’ve tried various diets and exercise with limited success, you have a sedentary lifestyle, and you’ve noticed fatigue, low motivation, knee pain, and shortness of breath. You have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, your mother had high blood pressure, and your father was overweight and smoked. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to the store later, you know? But yeah, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll keep it as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… Okay. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92, which is elevated, as we discussed. Your pulse is 88, which is within the normal range. Now, let's take a look at your throat and ears… Open wide and say “Ah”… Good. Your throat looks clear. And your ears look fine as well. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please relax, and let me know if anything feels tender. I’m not feeling any obvious tenderness, but your abdomen is slightly enlarged. Finally, I’d like to check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Ooh, that’s a little sore. It always is, especially when it's cold. They’ve been bothering me for a while now. They just… ache, you know? Especially after standing all day at work. It’s probably just old age, Doctor. I’m not as young as I used to be. But yeah, they’re definitely sore. It doesn't really hurt hurt, just… uncomfortable. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. That’s helpful information. I notice some crepitus in both knees – that’s a grinding sensation, which indicates some cartilage wear, likely related to your weight and activity level. There’s also some mild swelling around both knee joints. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, your weight is significantly impacting your health, contributing to elevated blood pressure, fatigue, knee pain, and decreased energy levels. It’s important we address this. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? I’m tired of being tired all the time, and my knees are killing me. Blood work, sure. Whatever it takes. When do I need to go get that done? And can my wife come with me? She always remembers stuff like that. I’m afraid I’ll forget.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kochubey. I understand. It’s very good that you have your wife’s support. Here's a lab requisition. You can go to the lab at \[Name of local lab], they are open from 8 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. Fasting for 12 hours is required before the blood draw, so preferably schedule it for first thing in the morning. And yes, your wife is more than welcome to come with you – it’s a good idea for her to be there. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a comprehensive plan. This may include lifestyle modifications, dietary changes, and potentially, a referral to a weight loss specialist to explore the possibility of surgical intervention, as you initially requested. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Lifestyle changes… I guess I need to try harder with that. And the specialist… that sounds good too. I mean, if it could help, I’m willing to try anything. So, blood work, then talk about the results, then see the specialist. That’s perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I know I’m not very good at explaining things, and I forget a lot. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or should I just go schedule the blood work? I don’t want to forget. My wife's probably already making a list. She’s very organized.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. And please, don’t worry about explaining things—you’ve been perfectly clear, and I’m here to help. For now, just scheduling the blood work is the most important step. Once you have the results, you can call the office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I'll also have the nurse send over a sheet with some basic dietary recommendations to get you started. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’m sure my wife will have a million questions later. She always does. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’m glad I came. I guess I’ll go schedule that blood work now. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions before then.
