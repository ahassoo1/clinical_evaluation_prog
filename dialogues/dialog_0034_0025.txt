DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about where my family come from. Long time ago, you know? I hear now you can find out with... with the spit? DNA, they call it? I want to see if that can help me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Scobie. You’re interested in learning more about your ancestry using DNA testing. That’s certainly something many people are curious about these days. It's good you're thinking about this. Before we get into ordering any tests, could you tell me a little bit more about what you already know about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. My mama, she come from the islands. Marshall Islands, I think. She never talk much about before she come here. Papa... he work on the boats. American boats. I don’t know where his people come from. Just… always here, mostly. We live small life. Fishing, building… I make little boats now, you see? That’s why I think maybe DNA can help. Fill in the blanks, yeah?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. It’s very common for family history to be incomplete, especially when stories aren’t written down. DNA testing can often provide some answers, or at least point you in the right direction. To help me understand your situation a little better, and to ensure this testing is the right approach for you, could you tell me if you have any concerns about the potential implications of learning more about your ancestry?
PATIENT: Implications? You mean... what if I don't like what I find? I don’t know… I just want to know. Maybe find cousins, people I never met. I don't think I worry too much. I old man now. Not much can surprise me, eh? But... I guess if it's something bad, something... sad... I don't know. I haven’t thought about that. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid point, Mr. Scobie. It’s wise to consider all possibilities. Sometimes DNA testing can reveal unexpected information about family relationships, or even historical events that might be difficult to process. It's not often bad information, but it can be surprising or emotionally challenging. Given your age and your desire to connect with family, I think this is still a reasonable path to explore. However, I want to make sure you’re prepared for a range of potential outcomes. We also want to make sure the test is appropriate given your health history. Do you have any known allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. Little itchy sometimes when the bugs bite, but that’s all. Medical… well, I got the old man things, you know? Back hurts sometimes. Doctor give me pills for that. And I take something for my water, keeps my blood pressure down. Otherwise, I pretty strong for my age. Been fishing all my life, keeps me healthy. Medicare pays for everything, so I don’t worry too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Scobie. The pills for your back and blood pressure are important to keep in mind. And it’s wonderful to hear you stay active with fishing! To clarify, what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. The little white one… starts with an ‘A’ I think. Ah! Amlodipine. Yes, Amlodipine. That’s the one. Small pill, take it every morning. Doctor said to keep taking it, no matter what. That’s why I don’t forget it. Old man memory, you know. But I remember the pill!
DOCTOR: Excellent, Amlodipine. Thank you for remembering that, Mr. Scobie. And don’t worry about the memory – it happens to the best of us! Okay, so to move forward with the DNA testing, there are a few different companies we can use. Most involve sending a saliva sample in the mail. The results can take several weeks to come back, and they’ll provide an ethnicity estimate and potentially identify genetic relatives. Would you like me to provide you with some information on a few of the reputable companies, and we can discuss which one might be the best fit for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be good, Doctor. Information is good. I don't know any of these companies. Just… spit in a tube? Seems easy enough. And weeks, you say? That’s okay. I got time. Slow life, remember? Just want to know a little more about where I come from. So, yes, information, please. Tell me about the… the spit tubes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. There are several well-regarded companies. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are two of the most popular. They both offer similar services – an ethnicity estimate based on your DNA and the potential to find living relatives who have also submitted their DNA. The process is quite simple. They’ll mail you a kit with a tube and instructions. You provide a saliva sample – usually by spitting into the tube a few times – and then you mail the kit back to the lab. They analyze your DNA and send you the results online through a secure website. The results are generally presented as percentages of your ethnicity – for example, 60% Marshallese, 20% Japanese, 10% Polynesian, and so on. It’s important to remember that these ethnicity estimates are just that – estimates. They’re based on comparing your DNA to reference populations, and they aren't always 100% accurate. They also don't provide information about your specific family history, only broad ethnic origins. Would you like me to show you their websites so you can compare their services and pricing?
PATIENT: Websites, yes. Good idea. I can see the pictures. I don't have computer myself, so I need to see it now. Percentages, you say? Hmm… 60% Marshallese would be nice. Hope it’s right. Show me. Slow and easy now, Doctor. I old eyes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here's the 23andMe website. As you can see, they have a section explaining how they analyze your DNA and provide ethnicity estimates. They also offer a feature to connect with potential relatives. And here is AncestryDNA. They focus more on building family trees and connecting you with historical records. They also offer DNA testing and ethnicity estimates. You can see both sites offer pretty similar information, but AncestryDNA might be better if you are interested in researching your family history in more detail. 23andMe is a little more focused on the ethnicity estimates and connecting you with relatives. Would you like me to point out the pricing differences?
PATIENT: Pricing… yes, that's important. I got Medicare, but maybe some things they don’t pay for. I don't want no surprises. Just… show me how much it costs. Simple numbers, Doctor. No fancy writing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. 23andMe has a basic ancestry kit for $99, and a health + ancestry kit for $199. The health kit provides some information about your genetic predisposition to certain health conditions, but it may not be covered by Medicare. AncestryDNA's basic kit is currently $99, and they often have sales. They also offer additional features like access to historical records for an extra monthly fee. Medicare generally doesn't cover DNA testing for ancestry purposes, unfortunately. So, you would be responsible for the full cost of the kit. Do you think either of these options seems appealing to you at this price point?
PATIENT: Ninety-nine dollars… hmm. Not too bad. Maybe the simple one, the 23andMe. No need for the health things, I already got a doctor for that. Just want to know where my family come from. Simple spit, ninety-nine dollars. Okay. Let's do that one. 23andMe. Can you help me order it? I don’t have computer, you know. And I don’t know about all the… the clicking and writing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. I can absolutely help you order the 23andMe ancestry kit. We can do it right here in the office. I'll need a few pieces of information from you – your full name, date of birth, and address. Don't worry, everything is kept confidential and secure. First, we'll create an account… let's use your email address… and then we'll enter your personal information… I'll help you with each step. Do you mind if I read your information aloud as I enter it, just to make sure everything is correct?
PATIENT: That's good, Doctor. Read it back. Old man eyes, you know. Sometimes I write things wrong. Email… yes, I have one. My niece set it up for me. Scobie… S-C-O-B-I-E. That's how you spell it. And the date of birth… August 12th, 1938. Yes, that's right. Read it back, please. Make sure you got it right. I don't want no trouble with the spit tubes!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, let’s confirm. Full name: Laury Scobie, S-C-O-B-I-E. Date of birth: August 12th, 1938. Email address… [I read the email address]. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's all right. Good. You got it. Email… yes, that’s my niece’s address. She helps me with the computer things. So, what happens next? Do I get the spit tube now? When will I get it? I hope it's not too much spitting!
DOCTOR: Perfect! The order is placed. You should receive an email confirmation shortly, and the 23andMe kit will be shipped to your address within 5-7 business days. The kit includes detailed instructions on how to collect the saliva sample. It involves spitting into a small tube a few times – it’s not a lot, don’t worry! They provide a specific amount you need to collect. Once you've collected the sample, you simply mail the kit back to their lab using the prepaid shipping label they include. It usually takes about 6-8 weeks to receive the results. They’ll send you an email notification when your results are ready. Would you like me to print out these instructions for you to have on hand?
PATIENT: Six to eight weeks… hmm. Long time. But okay. Spit and wait. I can do that. Instructions, yes, please. Good to have. I forget things, you know. Maybe I'll ask my niece to help me remember when it comes. Thank you, Doctor. You been very helpful. I appreciate it. Now I just gotta wait for the spit tube!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I’m glad I could help. Here are the instructions. They’re pretty straightforward, but don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Just gotta wait for the spit tube and see what it says. Thank you again for your help. You been very patient with an old man and his questions. I’ll see you around, maybe. Goodbye now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to hearing about your results when they come in! .
