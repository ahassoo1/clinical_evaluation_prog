DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pirl. It is also a pleasure to meet you. I am here because… well, my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of fluid comes out, sometimes. It is not painful, but it is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Leaking fluid, you say. Not painful, but concerning. Alright. Could you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it began, I believe, about one week ago. Perhaps a little longer. I was… washing my face, and I noticed it after. It was only a very small amount at first, but now… a little more each day, I think. It is from my left ear.
DOCTOR: One week ago, after washing your face… and it’s from the left ear. Has there been any pain associated with it at all – even a mild ache?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain at all. And no… ringing, or feeling dizzy. Just… the liquid. It is… clear liquid, I think. Not blood, or anything. Just like water, almost. Though, I have not… tasted it, if that is what you are asking.
DOCTOR: Clear liquid, no pain, no ringing or dizziness… Good. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any fullness in your ear?
PATIENT: Fullness? Hmm… that is a good question. Sometimes, yes. I feel… like something is inside. Not blocked, exactly, but… full. Like when you go on a plane and your ears pop. A little bit like that feeling, but… not as strong. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, a feeling of fullness, intermittent, like pressure. And has anything specifically caused this to start, that you can recall?
PATIENT: That is… difficult to say. I have been… very busy with my work at the college. Grading papers, preparing for classes. I have not been… taking very good care of myself, I suppose. No swimming, no loud noises… just… work. Perhaps that is it? Stress, maybe? I do not remember doing anything to injure my ear.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to many things. Okay. And, if you don’t mind me asking, do you have any history of ear infections, or any other ear problems that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. When I was a young boy, growing up in Somalia, we did not have… doctors, very often. If you were sick, you… you tried to get better yourself. I have never had anything serious with my ears before. No infections, no pain, nothing. This is… new. I worry it is something bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Radillo. It’s good to know you haven’t had any prior ear issues. Alright. I'd like to take a look at your ear now, if you don’t mind. I'll need to use an otoscope, it won't hurt. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. I would like to know what is causing this. An otoscope… is that the… the light thing you look into? It does not matter to me. Please, look. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. It’s a light with a small magnifying instrument. I'm just going to gently insert it into your ear canal to take a look. Try to remain still for me. Hmm… I see some fluid behind the eardrum, and the eardrum itself appears a little bit cloudy. It doesn't appear to be a rupture, thankfully. It could be fluid buildup due to Eustachian tube dysfunction. We will want to take a look at your medical history to get a better understanding. Do you mind if I take a moment to review that on the computer?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Please, take your time. I will sit quietly. Eustachian tube… that sounds complicated. Is that… serious? I hope it is nothing too troublesome. I have papers to grade, you see. A long week ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see no prior history of ear problems in your records, which is good. Eustachian tube dysfunction simply means the tube that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat isn't functioning optimally. It can cause fluid buildup, like we're seeing here. It's usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left untreated, could lead to an infection. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this is likely Eustachian tube dysfunction. I'm going to recommend a trial of a decongestant and a course of observation. We will also want to use some nasal spray. Would you be comfortable trying that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. A decongestant and nasal spray. I can certainly try that. Is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps… avoiding certain things? I can try to rest more, if that would help. Though, the college… they are very demanding. But I will try. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Rest is always helpful, though I understand your situation. Avoid blowing your nose too forcefully, and try to stay hydrated. I’m prescribing a decongestant to take by mouth, and a nasal saline spray to use several times a day. I'll also print out some instructions on managing Eustachian tube dysfunction. We'll monitor your symptoms for the next week or so. If you notice any increased pain, fever, or if the fluid doesn't improve, or gets worse, please call the office immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies. I have taken many medicines in my life, and never had a reaction. The instructions… are they in English? My English is not… the best. If they are too complicated, perhaps you could explain the most important parts to me? I do not want to misunderstand anything.
DOCTOR: They are in English, yes. I apologize. I will go over the key points with you now. Essentially, the decongestant helps to reduce swelling in your nasal passages, which can open up the Eustachian tube. The nasal spray helps to keep the passages moist and clear. Use the spray several times a day, especially when you feel congested. Avoid sudden changes in pressure – like flying or scuba diving. And most importantly, if the symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, contact us right away. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… much clearer. Decongestant to reduce swelling, nasal spray to keep it moist, and avoid pressure changes. And contact you if it gets worse. I believe I understand. Thank you for explaining it so… slowly. It is very kind of you. Is there anything else I need to know? Perhaps about… side effects of the medicine? I do not want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. The decongestant can sometimes cause a bit of dryness in your mouth or a slight increase in blood pressure. If you experience any palpitations, dizziness, or severe headache, stop taking the medication and contact us. The nasal spray is generally very well-tolerated. I’ll also write a note for your primary care physician informing them of my findings. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very well. I will follow your instructions carefully. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and… patience. I appreciate your help very much. Perhaps this will resolve quickly, and I can return to my grading.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I hope it resolves quickly as well. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. I'll make a note to follow up with you in a week to check on your progress. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well.
