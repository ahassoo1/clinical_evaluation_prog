DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 83 years young. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Eighty-three, yes… a considerable number of years. It’s… well, it’s a rather delicate matter. I’ve noticed a… discharge. A most unpleasant thing, really. Not something a man of my age expects, you understand. It’s been… happening for a little while now. I suppose that’s all you need to know to begin with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. A discharge can certainly be concerning. And you’re quite right to address it. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Goodness… it’s… fluid. That’s the most accurate way to put it, I suppose. Not particularly… thick, but not water, either. A sort of… milky colour, I believe. And there's… an odour. Not a pleasant one, naturally. I haven’t been able to pinpoint precisely what it smells like, but it’s… noticeable. It's difficult to explain these things, Doctor. A man doesn’t often discuss such matters.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing this with me, Mr. Krok, despite the discomfort. “Milky colour” and an odour… that gives me some preliminary information. Now, is this discharge constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes… yes, that’s accurate. It's not a continuous flow, thankfully. Some days I notice nothing at all. Others… well, others it’s more apparent. It seems… worse after I’ve been… active. Though, at my age, “active” is a rather generous term, wouldn’t you agree? I wouldn't say it's predictable, though. It just… happens. A most bothersome irregularity.
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent and associated with activity. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Let me think… Not that I’ve noticed, no. No burning, no itching, no… discomfort in that region, aside from the… issue itself. I’ve not felt any pain, thankfully. Though, I do feel a bit… tired lately. But that could just be my age, you understand. I tire easily these days. It's difficult to say what’s related to this and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: Very well. And has there been any fever, chills, or any changes in your urinary habits – frequency, urgency, difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don't believe so. My wife keeps a close eye on me, and she would have noticed. Chills, no. As for… urinating… Well, it’s not easy as it once was, naturally. A gentleman gets older, things slow down. I go more frequently than I used to, certainly. And sometimes it takes a moment to… begin. But I wouldn’t say it's difficult. Just… slower. Is that what you were asking, Doctor? It's hard to remember these details.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Krok. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a long list, Doctor. Let me see… I had a touch of high blood pressure, years ago. They put me on some… pills. I don’t take them anymore, though. The doctor said it was under control. And I had a bit of trouble with my heart a while back, but they fixed it. A little… operation. I believe that’s all. My wife handles most of the medical details, you see. She’s quite organized. I can’t recall the specifics of everything. It's all a bit of a blur. And I'm sure there were other minor ailments over the years… nothing of significance, I’m certain.
DOCTOR: Understood. High blood pressure, previously managed with medication, and a cardiac procedure in the past. Do you recall the type of cardiac procedure?
PATIENT: The type… Goodness. It involved… a tube. Yes, a tube inserted into… somewhere. They inflated something. It was rather unpleasant, I remember that. It wasn't open heart surgery, if that's what you're asking. They didn't cut me open. It was… minimally invasive, I believe my wife said. I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be of more assistance. My memory isn’t what it once was. It was… some years ago now. A very long time ago. I believe it was something to do with… blocked arteries? But I’m only guessing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It’s not always easy to recall details from the past. And you’ve provided a good deal of helpful information already. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see… Just a little blue pill, Doctor. For… well, you know. Helps me sleep. My wife gets it for me. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take some… ibuprofen, I believe it’s called. Just when it’s particularly bothersome. That's all, I think. Nothing else. My wife keeps a list of everything, of course. She’s very diligent.
DOCTOR: A sleep aid and ibuprofen as needed. And you mentioned your wife keeps a list – is it possible she could bring that in for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a wonderful idea, Doctor! Yes, she absolutely could. She's quite organized, my wife. Keeps everything in a little binder. Medications, doctors’ appointments, everything. It would save us both a great deal of trouble, I assure you. She'll bring it next time, I'm certain of it. She's very eager to help. A most capable woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else.
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That’s another tricky one. I don’t believe I have any, Doctor. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing. I recall being stung by a bee as a child, but I didn’t have a particularly bad reaction. My wife says I’m not allergic to anything, but she also says I should eat more vegetables. So, take that as you will. I suppose I’m mostly allergic to hard work these days, but that’s not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand. No known allergies. Very well, Mr. Krok. Now, I would like to conduct a physical exam to better assess your condition. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I will need to examine the area of concern. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An examination… yes, I suppose it’s necessary. It’s not a particularly pleasant prospect, but I understand you need to do your job, Doctor. Yes, proceed. Just… be gentle, if you would. A gentleman of my age isn’t as resilient as he once was. And please, don't keep me waiting too long. My wife is preparing lunch, and she makes a lovely lamb stew.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. Now, if you would please lie back on the examination table. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a faint murmur. I’ll make a note of that. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I observe a small amount of milky discharge from the urethral opening. There is no visible inflammation or redness at this time.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find, Doctor? Is it… serious? I trust it’s not something… untoward. I’ve lived a good life, you know. I wouldn’t want anything to… disrupt it now. Please, tell me honestly. A gentleman deserves to know the truth, even if it’s not what he wants to hear. And hurry, if you would. My wife will be wondering where I am. The stew, you know. It doesn't keep.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, based on the examination, I observed a small amount of milky discharge from your urethra. The absence of significant inflammation at this time is… reassuring, but the discharge does require investigation. The most likely possibilities include a non-gonococcal urethritis, or possibly prostatitis. It is also possible, though less common at your age, that this could be a urethral stricture. We need to rule out any underlying infection. I do not believe this is immediately life-threatening, but it does need to be addressed to prevent any potential complications. To do so, I would like to order a urinalysis and urine culture to identify any bacteria present. We may also need to consider further imaging, such as a cystoscopy, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… urine culture… cystoscopy… Goodness. It sounds… complicated. And rather unpleasant, I must say. Imaging… involving tubes again? My wife will not be pleased. She dislikes these sorts of procedures. But… if it’s necessary… if it’s to prevent complications… Very well, Doctor. Do what you must. But please, be as quick and as gentle as possible. And explain everything to my wife. She worries, you see. She deserves to know what’s happening. And perhaps… perhaps you could recommend a good brand of lamb stew? Something to take my mind off things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I will explain the procedures thoroughly to your wife and will do everything I can to ensure your comfort. As for stew recommendations… I'm afraid my expertise lies more in medicine than in culinary arts. However, I can recommend a reputable online resource for recipes if you wish. I will write an order for the urinalysis and urine culture now. The lab will contact you to schedule a collection appointment. We will review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps at that time. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding any activities that may irritate the area. If you experience any fever, chills, or increased pain, please contact the office immediately. Here is the requisition for the lab. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Drinking plenty of fluids… avoiding activities… It seems my golden years are proving less golden than I’d hoped. No questions, Doctor, not at the moment. I suspect my wife will have a great many questions, though. She always does. Well, thank you, Doctor. For your… thoroughness. And for your patience. I shall leave it to my wife to arrange the… collection appointment. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea will help calm my nerves. Good day to you, Doctor. And please… try not to recommend any tubes. .
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Krok. And I will certainly keep that in mind. .
