DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t we start by you telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s about my foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better. A sore, really. A bad one. And it smells, I hate to say. I’ve tried putting creams on it, but nothing seems to work. I suppose you’ll want to see it.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. I'd like to take a look. Could you tell me a little more about when this sore first started?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was sometime after my grandson left for college, so… July, maybe? Yes, early July. I remember because he helped me with the garden before he left, and I think that’s when I first noticed it. Just a little redness at first, on the bottom of my foot. Didn’t think much of it, you know? Old people get little aches and pains all the time. But then it started getting bigger, and redder, and now… well, you see it. It's a nuisance, really. And it’s making it hard to wear my slippers. I need my slippers.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this to our attention now. And slippers are important! To help me understand a bit better, is there anything specific that makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Walking, of course. Any walking at all. Standing is bad too. Even just…shifting my weight on it. It feels like a hot coal is stuck to my foot, and then someone pokes it with a needle. And sometimes, at night, it throbs. It keeps me awake, honestly. I've been trying to keep my weight off it, but it's hard. I still have things to do, you know. I'm not completely helpless. Though my grandson keeps offering to do everything for me… it's a bit much.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Well… yes, I suppose. It’s…not a nice sight, Doctor. It’s… yellowish, and sometimes a bit… smelly. That's why I mentioned the smell earlier. I've been trying to keep it clean with a damp cloth, but it just seems to keep coming back. It gets on my socks, and I have to be careful not to get it on the carpet. It’s really quite bothersome, honestly. I've always kept a tidy house, you know. I can’t stand mess. It's probably from the heat, isn't it? All this humidity. Makes everything fester, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. Thank you for sharing all of that. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of what’s been going on. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to take a closer look at your foot and do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Just be gentle, please. My skin is quite thin, you know. And I don't like surprises. I'm not a fan of surprises at all. Do you need me to… take my sock off? I suppose I should have taken it off already. Honestly, I’m usually more organized than this. It’s this heat, I tell you. It just throws everything off.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you’re comfortable, removing your sock would be best. And don't worry about being organized, Ms. Cannington. We all have our off days. I will be as gentle as possible. Would you like to sit here?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A chair would be good. My legs aren’t what they used to be, you know. Used to be able to walk for miles, I did. Now… not so much. There. Be warned, it’s not a pretty sight. And try not to make a fuss. I don't like a lot of attention drawn to it. Honestly, it’s just a nuisance. A very smelly nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington. I see what you mean. It does appear to be an ulcer, and it’s quite inflamed. There’s some redness extending beyond the sore itself, and I do notice some discharge, as you mentioned. I’m also noting some warmth around the area. Does this cause you any particular pain when I touch it?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that’s quite tender, Doctor. Very tender indeed. It feels… like a burning sensation, and then a sharp pain. Don’t poke it too much, please. It’s not comfortable, you know. Honestly, it feels like it’s going right to the bone. I've had a lot of aches and pains in my life, but this… this is different. This is unpleasant. Are you sure you need to poke it so much? I thought you were just looking at it.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Cannington. I was only trying to assess the extent of the inflammation, but I should have been more gentle. You're right, I don’t need to poke it further. I'm also noting the condition of your skin overall. It appears dry and somewhat fragile, which is common with age. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any other symptoms alongside this sore?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Nothing like that. Just… this sore, and the pain. And the smell, of course. Can't forget the smell. I feel a bit tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. I don’t sleep as well as I used to, either. Keeps me up at night, this pain. Honestly, it’s just a general feeling of being unwell, you know? Not sick, exactly, just… not myself. My grandson keeps telling me I should eat more vegetables, but I’ve never been one for vegetables. Prefer a nice piece of fish, I do. Though I haven't been feeling much like eating anything lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cannington. Given your age, the appearance of the ulcer, the presence of inflammation, and the reported pain and discharge, I’m concerned about a possible infection. It’s difficult to say definitively without further testing, however. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I'd like to take a sample of the discharge from the ulcer to send to the lab for a culture and sensitivity test. This will help us identify any bacteria causing the infection and determine the most effective antibiotic, if needed. I'd also like to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes, as this can contribute to poor wound healing and increase the risk of infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. My husband, God rest his soul, he had that. Not a pleasant thing, not at all. And an infection… Well, that sounds serious, doesn’t it? Tests, you say? Fine, fine. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick about it, please. And be gentle. I don’t want any more poking. And tell me what all this will cost, you hear? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers most things, but… I don’t want any surprises on the bill. Honestly, this is all very unsettling. A bit much for a simple sore, don't you think?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington. It is unsettling, and I apologize for any worry this is causing you. We will proceed as gently as possible, and I will explain everything thoroughly. The tests are relatively quick. The culture will involve a small swab of the discharge, and the blood sugar test will require a small blood sample from your finger. Regarding costs, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests. However, there may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your plan. Our billing department will verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs before proceeding. I can have them call you with that information after the tests are completed. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Explain it to me. I like to know what's happening, you know. Don't want any surprises. Swabbing sounds… unpleasant. And poking my finger… well, I suppose I can tolerate a little poke. But not too much. Tell me everything. And how long will it take? I have my afternoon tea at three o’clock, and I don’t like to be late for my tea. It’s a very important ritual, you know. It keeps me grounded. Honestly, this is disrupting my whole schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I’ll explain everything as we go. The swab will involve using a small cotton swab to gently collect a sample of the discharge from the ulcer. It shouldn’t cause any significant discomfort – more of a brief, slightly cool sensation. It takes just a few seconds. The blood sugar test will involve a quick prick of your finger using a small lancet – a tiny, sterile needle. We'll squeeze a small drop of blood onto a test strip, and the machine will give us a reading almost immediately. It also takes just a few seconds. Both tests can be done right here in the examination room. The entire process should take no more than ten to fifteen minutes, so you’ll have plenty of time to make it to your afternoon tea. I’ll make sure we’re as quick and efficient as possible. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Ten minutes, you say? And no poking for too long? Very well. Get it over with, then. But be gentle, Doctor. I’m warning you. And try not to make a mess. Honestly, I can’t stand mess. And do tell me what you’re doing as you go. I like to be informed. Don't just poke and prod without telling me what’s happening. It’s… unnerving, you know? Now, get on with it. Before I change my mind. And be careful with my slippers! They’re very delicate.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go. I’m just cleaning the area to ensure a sterile sample. This might feel a little cool. Now, I’m just collecting a small sample of the discharge. It shouldn’t cause any pain, just a brief sensation. There we go. That’s the sample collected. Now, I’m just cleaning your fingertip in preparation for the blood sugar test. Just a quick prick. And there we go. The machine is analyzing the sample now… The results are in. Your blood sugar level is 135 mg/dL. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly high. It’s possible this is due to recent eating or stress, but we'll need to follow up with further testing to determine if this is consistent. There we are. All finished. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Slightly elevated, you say? My husband used to talk about blood sugar. Not a good thing, was it? And my finger feels a bit tender. Honestly, all this poking and prodding is quite unsettling. So, what does it mean? Am I sick? Will I need… injections? I don't like needles. At all. And what about this infection? Will I need… antibiotics? My grandson keeps telling me about antibiotics, and how they mess up your stomach. Honestly, I feel quite overwhelmed. This is all very stressful. I just wanted someone to look at my sore, not… become a science experiment. Now, are you sure you didn't poke me too much? My slippers… they’re feeling a bit squished.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cannington, and I apologize for any discomfort or anxiety this has caused you. You are not a science experiment, I assure you. We’re simply gathering information to determine the best course of action. A slightly elevated blood sugar level doesn’t necessarily mean you have diabetes. It could be temporary. However, it’s important to rule it out, so I'd like to schedule a follow-up blood test, preferably after a period of fasting, to get a more accurate reading. Regarding the infection, the culture results will tell us what bacteria is causing it and which antibiotics will be most effective. If antibiotics are needed, we'll start with the mildest option possible, and I can also recommend probiotics to help protect your stomach. Your slippers do appear a little squished, but that’s likely due to the examination. They should return to their normal shape shortly. For now, let’s focus on getting the culture results back and scheduling that follow-up blood test. We’ll take things one step at a time. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes. That sounds… less overwhelming. But I still don't like the sound of needles. Or antibiotics. And probiotics… what are probiotics? Sounds like something you’d put in a garden. And how long will these results take? I have my book club meeting next week, and I don't want to miss it. We’re discussing a very important novel, you see. And I promised to bring the biscuits. And will this infection… spread? Will I need to go to the hospital? My grandson keeps telling me about hospital germs. Honestly, I'm getting quite anxious. Just tell me, Doctor, will I be alright? And don't tell me to take it one step at a time. I need a straight answer.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Cannington, and I want to assure you that you are currently not in any immediate danger. It’s good you are asking these questions. The culture results should be back within 3-5 business days. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that help restore the balance of microorganisms in your gut, especially when you are taking antibiotics. They come in capsule form and can help prevent stomach upset. Think of them as good helpers for your tummy. The risk of the infection spreading is low, but it's important to treat it promptly. We'll monitor the sore closely, and if it worsens, we'll adjust the treatment accordingly. As for needing to go to the hospital, that is unlikely at this time. Hospitalization is usually reserved for more severe infections. We can manage this in the clinic with antibiotics and regular follow-ups. To answer your question directly: yes, you will be alright. We're taking the necessary steps to address this infection and rule out any other underlying issues. We'll work together to keep you healthy and comfortable. Now, let's schedule that follow-up blood test. Would next Tuesday morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday morning… yes. That might work. But I’ll need a ride. My grandson is busy with… things. Young people and their things. And I don't like to bother the neighbors. And what about the biscuits? Will I be well enough to bake the biscuits? They’re a very important part of the book club meeting. They’re shortbread, you see. A very delicate recipe. And what if I can’t concentrate? I need to be focused when I’m baking. Honestly, this is all very stressful. And can you write all this down for me? I forget things, you know. Even important things. And can you make sure it’s in big letters? My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And can you include a reminder about the slippers? They’re very delicate, you see. And… and what if I get a fever? Will someone call my grandson? He worries a lot. Honestly…
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. I’ll write everything down for you in big letters. And we’ll make sure to address all your concerns.
