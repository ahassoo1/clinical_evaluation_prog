DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it's my ears, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble. It's hard to explain… sometimes I just… can’t hear. And then everything spins. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully, but it’s worrying me. My husband… he used to get something similar, is why I came in.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with your ears and some dizziness… and it sounds like your husband had similar issues. That’s helpful to know. Just to clarify, when you say you "can’t hear," is that in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that's a good question. You know, it comes and goes so quickly, I really can't say for sure. I think it's usually just the one… the left one, maybe? But sometimes it’s hard to tell. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a bit of a blur is perfectly alright. We'll try to get a clearer picture. And the spinning sensation – does that happen at the same time as the hearing loss, or does it come on separately?
PATIENT: Usually… usually they happen together. The hearing goes, and then whoosh – everything goes round and round. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. A few minutes, maybe? But it’s quite frightening when it happens. I feel… unsteady on my feet too, during those times.
DOCTOR: Okay, hearing loss and dizziness happening together, lasting a few minutes, with some unsteadiness. That gives us a bit more to work with. Have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: Triggers…? Oh dear. That's another thing I can't quite put my finger on. It seems to happen… randomly? I haven't noticed anything specific that brings it on. I've been trying to think, but… no, not that I can recall. I've been trying to be careful, you know, avoiding loud noises, but it still happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be happening spontaneously, despite your best efforts to avoid triggers. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. Well, I have Medicare, so I’ve seen a few doctors over the years. Nothing major, I don’t think. My blood pressure's a little high sometimes, but I take medication for that. And my knees are… well, they're old knees! Aside from that… no, not that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension, and some knee issues. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Oh, now see, that’s where my memory gets… fuzzy. I have a little brown bottle… the doctor prescribed it. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street. I'm afraid I don’t remember the name. I just… take the pills every day. Would they have a record of it?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright; we can certainly check with the pharmacy. We'll get to the bottom of it. Now, have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, ringing, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, I think I had an ear infection when I was a child, but it was so long ago… I barely remember it. No ringing, though, not that I’m aware of. And no, nothing else with my ears, not until this started happening. It's just the hearing loss and the spinning, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous ear problems to speak of. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I'm just going to take a look inside your ears. This might be a little cool. …Hmm. I see a little bit of cerumen – some earwax – but nothing particularly concerning. And the right ear looks clear. Now, if you could just stand up for me, if you're able, and put your feet together. I just want to check your balance. Okay, and now close your eyes for a moment…
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Goodness, that’s a bit wobbly. Oh dear… I think I’m going to sit down. That’s not very good, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn't, and that's helpful information. You did well to sit down quickly. Based on what you've told me, and the quick examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called Vestibular Neuritis, or possibly Ménière’s disease. Both can cause episodes of vertigo – that spinning sensation – and hearing loss. However, it's too early to say for sure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Tests…? Oh dear… what kind of tests? I don’t like the sound of tests. Will they be… unpleasant? I get a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Terasa. Nothing too unpleasant, I promise. We'll start with a simple hearing test – an audiogram – just to see how well you're hearing in each ear. And then, I’d like to order a VNG test – a Videonystagmography – which measures your eye movements to assess your inner ear function. It involves wearing goggles and moving your head in different directions. It doesn't hurt, but it can sometimes make you feel a little dizzy. Would you be comfortable with those two tests?
PATIENT: Goggles…? And dizziness…? Oh dear. Alright… alright, if you think it’s necessary. But please, be gentle. And if I feel really unwell, I want to stop, okay? I don't want to push myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. That’s perfectly reasonable. We'll stop at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. I'll write you a referral for the hearing test and VNG. The scheduler will call you to set up appointments. While you wait for those results, I’m going to prescribe you some medication to help manage the dizziness. It's called meclizine. It's an antihistamine that can reduce the spinning sensation. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. I don't think so. My husband used to handle all the medication, you see. But… I did have a rash once, many years ago, after taking some kind of antibiotic. I don't remember the name, though. And it was a long time ago. Would that be a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, a rash with an antibiotic in the past. That's good to know, and we’ll take that into consideration. Meclizine is not an antibiotic, so it's unlikely to cause a similar reaction. But we'll start with a low dose, just to be safe. I'll send this to your pharmacy. It's important to take it as directed, and let me know if you experience any side effects. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I've been worrying about this for so long. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And please, do let me know if you find anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. That's what I'm here for. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The scheduler will be in touch to arrange those tests. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed, and your prescription information. Have a good day, and please take care.
