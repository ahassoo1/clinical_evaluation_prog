DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hi. It's my nails. They... look funny. Not good funny. I think they changed. I don't remember when exactly, but they just... do. It bothers me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in your nails can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. When you say they “changed,” can you describe how they've changed?
PATIENT: Oh, you know... different. Like... the color. Not like a polish, but... off. And they feel... thicker maybe? Harder? I don't... I don't really look at my nails, usually. I just noticed they didn’t look right when I was doing dishes the other day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a change in color and thickness. That’s helpful. And it was relatively recent, noticed while doing dishes… roughly when would that have been?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates... I don't know. Last week sometime? Maybe a little longer? It all kinda blends together, you know? I’m not good with remembering things like that. It wasn’t months ago, definitely. Not like, Christmas time or something.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Ms. Thut. An approximate timeframe is perfectly fine. So, within the last few weeks. Have you noticed any changes around your nails as well?
PATIENT: Around...? Like the skin? Hmm... Let me see... I think... maybe a little red around the edges of some of them? Not all, just a couple. And it kinda... hurts if I push on it. A little. It's not, like, bad pain, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, redness and some discomfort around the nail edges. And is this happening on all of your fingers and toes, or just certain ones?
PATIENT: Oh, just my fingers. My toes are fine. I always forget about my toes. It's only the nails on my hands. Mostly the ones I use the most, I guess. Like, my right hand... I do a lot with my right hand.
DOCTOR: Alright, primarily on your right hand, and involving the nails you use most frequently. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No... not really. I feel okay, otherwise. No fever or anything. Just... these nails. And it's annoying. You know? It just feels wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you don't have any other symptoms, that’s reassuring. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Fine. Be gentle, okay? I don't like it when people mess with my hands.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay. I'm noting some subtle discoloration of several nails, with a yellowish tinge. There is some mild thickening, as you mentioned, and I can appreciate some tenderness to palpation around the nail folds on your right hand. I also see some minor inflammation of the skin around the base of a few nails. It appears there is some mild pitting of the nail surface as well. Do you have any history of fungal infections, or have you had any recent trauma to your nails?
PATIENT: Fungal...? No, I don't think so. Never had anything like that. Trauma? Like... breaking a nail? Maybe. I break a nail sometimes when I’m cleaning. It’s just a little break, nothing big. I don’t remember hurting them badly though. I'm not a clumsy person.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of fungal infections and only minor nail trauma. Have you noticed any changes to your skin elsewhere on your body?
PATIENT: Nope. Skin’s fine. Always has been. I don't have problems with rashes or anything. I get a little dry in the winter, but that's all. I use lotion.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s go over your medical history quickly. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I can eat anything, as far as I know. No reactions to any medicines. I haven't taken much medicine lately. Maybe a pain reliever for a headache sometimes. Nothing special. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And what about any past medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, old age. That’s about it. Just the usual aches and pains. My knees bother me sometimes. And I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that’s old news. Nothing else really. I'm pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, some knee pain and a cholecystectomy in the past. And what about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the vitamins. You know, the everyday ones. And sometimes, if my knees are really bad, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think? The little white pills. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamins and occasional ibuprofen. And finally, do you have any family history of nail problems, skin conditions, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Auto… what now? Look, my family is from... a long way away. I don't really know much about their medical problems. We don't talk about that stuff. Everyone was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No one had funny looking nails or anything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Thut. That’s very common. Based on what you’ve told me, and my examination, the changes to your nails could be indicative of several things. It's likely a fungal infection, but it's also possible it could be a form of nail psoriasis, or even a reaction to something you’ve been exposed to. To be certain, I would like to order a nail fungal culture. This will help us identify if a fungus is present and what type it is. We can also consider a skin biopsy, if the culture is negative, to rule out other conditions. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Like… cutting my skin? No. No, I don’t like that at all. A culture… is that just scraping my nail? That’s okay, I guess. If you have to. But no cutting! I don't need any of that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. No cutting. We'll start with the nail fungal culture. It's a simple procedure; we'll gently scrape a small portion of the affected nails, and it doesn't require any cutting or injections. I will also order a blood test to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the nail changes. We can discuss treatment options once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails short and dry, and avoiding harsh chemicals. I will also prescribe an antifungal cream to apply topically. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. A cream is okay. Short and dry... I can do that. I guess. Blood test… ugh. But okay, if you need it. Just get it over with. I hope it doesn’t take too long to figure out what’s wrong with my nails. I just want them to look normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Thut. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this quickly. I’m writing the orders for the fungal culture, blood test, and antifungal cream now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood test appointment. Here’s the prescription for the cream. Apply it twice daily to the affected nails, as directed. I’ll also have my nurse come in to provide you with instructions on proper nail care. We’ll follow up in two weeks to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. I hope this works. And tell your nurse to be gentle, okay? I really don't like people messing with my hands.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. I'll make a note for the nurse to be especially gentle. We'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's a printout summarizing today’s discussion and the orders. Thank you for coming in today. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Bye.
