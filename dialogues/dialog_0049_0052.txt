DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see. Happens most mornings now, right when I wake up. It's not…violent, not like throwing up, but just a really queasy feeling. And I know… I know it's probably connected to my heart. It's been a bit rough lately, the heart, and I was told to come in if anything changed. This feels like a change.
DOCTOR: Right, a change. And how long has this nausea been going on, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? At first, it was just once or twice a week, I could ignore it. But the last week, it’s been nearly every morning. Definitely worse this week. I try to have a wee bit of toast with my tea, but even that doesn’t always help. It's just…unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: Unsettling. And besides the nausea, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not the kind of tired from a long day, but just… drained. And my ankles have been swelling up a bit in the evenings. I thought it was just the heat, mind you, it’s been rather warm lately. But maybe it's connected to this… heart business. I don't know, honestly. I’m not one for guessing.
DOCTOR: Drained and ankle swelling. Hmm. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: Aye, now that you ask, I have. Not constantly, but when I’m doing…well, anything more than a slow walk. Used to be able to potter about the garden all day, no problem. Now I have to stop and catch my breath after a wee bit. Didn’t think much of it at first, figured I was just getting old! But it’s definitely getting worse, like everything else. Is that… bad? I’m sorry to bother you with all this.
DOCTOR: It's not bothering me at all, Mr. Benic. We need to gather information. Now, let's go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the heart issue?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think. Years ago, I had a touch of arthritis in my hands. Not bad, just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise, until lately. I’ve been seeing Dr. MacLeod for the heart, of course, and he's kept me on a few different medications, but I can't rightly recall the names of them. He changes them about now and then. Is it important I remember? It’s been a wee bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, but we can look them up. Do you have a list of your current medications, or perhaps the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Aye, I do! I keep a wee notebook with everything. Just a moment… Here you are. It’s a bit messy, apologies. It's got all the names and dosages, as far as I can tell. Dr. MacLeod's handwriting isn't the easiest to read, bless him. And the pharmacy is Henderson's, just down the high street. Everyone goes to Henderson's.
DOCTOR: Right, let's see… Digoxin, Lisinopril, and…Amlodipine. And an Aspirin. Okay. Have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve taken a fair few pills in my time, with the arthritis and now the heart, but never had a reaction. Just the usual wee bit of a tummy ache sometimes, but nothing serious. I’m fairly sturdy, generally. Unless you count a fondness for Irn-Bru, but I don’t think that’s an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. My father… he had a bad heart, same as me. Had to have a wee operation when he was in his sixties, but he lived to be eighty-five, so it wasn't too bad. My mother, she was healthy as a horse. Lived to ninety, she did. My sister, she's got arthritis, like me, but that's about it. Nothing major, as far as I know. They’re both gone now, bless them. It’s just me and my memories, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I used to enjoy a wee dram of whisky now and then, but Dr. MacLeod told me to cut back. So I mostly stick to tea these days. A nice strong builder’s tea, keeps me going! Just the one sugar, mind you. Don't want to go completely mad.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Aye, certainly. Happy to help in any way I can. Just a bit slow these days, you understand. Old bones, you know. Here I go. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths for me. I’m hearing some… congestion in your lungs, and your heart rate is a bit irregular. I also detect a slight murmur. And your ankles are indeed swollen, with some pitting edema. Your blood pressure is also elevated: 160 over 95. And your respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute, which is slightly high.
PATIENT: Right. Well, that doesn’t sound terribly good, does it? Congestion, irregularity, swelling… I was expecting something wasn’t right, mind you, with the nausea and the tiredness. Dr. MacLeod mentioned my heart wasn’t as strong as it used to be. What does all this mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Don't beat around the bush with me, I've lived a long life, I can handle the truth. Is it my heart getting worse?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Benic, based on what I’m hearing and feeling, and considering your symptoms, it does appear your heart condition is worsening. The congestion in your lungs and swelling in your ankles suggest fluid retention, which is often a sign of heart failure. The irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, is also concerning. The nausea could be related to reduced blood flow. It’s not something we can definitively diagnose without further testing. I want to order some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolytes, an EKG to assess the arrhythmia, and a chest X-ray to evaluate the congestion in your lungs. We also need to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. I'm going to send you to a cardiologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can perform an echocardiogram to get a detailed look at your heart's structure and function. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s an emergency, but it is something we need to address promptly. I’ll have the receptionist schedule those tests for you right away. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Right. Well, that’s… a lot to take in. Tests, cardiologists, echocardiograms… It's a bit overwhelming, to be honest. So, what’s the… the worst-case scenario here, Doctor? I’m not asking you to sugarcoat anything, I just want to be prepared. And… will these tests be expensive? I’m not insured, you see, and I'm on a fixed income. I’d hate to run up a huge bill I can’t pay. What if it is serious… what kind of treatment would I be looking at? And… could it be managed, or…?
DOCTOR: Mr. Benic, I understand your concerns. It’s natural to be worried. The worst-case scenario would be severe heart failure requiring hospitalization and potentially more invasive interventions like a pacemaker or even a heart transplant, though that is unlikely at this stage. As for the cost, I’m aware you are uninsured. I will speak with the billing department and see if we can arrange a payment plan or explore any financial assistance programs available. The hospital also has social workers who can help navigate these issues. As for treatment, if it is confirmed to be heart failure, it typically involves medication to manage fluid retention, control blood pressure, and improve heart function. Lifestyle modifications, such as a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise, are also crucial. In many cases, heart failure can be effectively managed with medication and lifestyle changes, allowing patients to live a relatively normal life. However, it does require ongoing monitoring and adherence to a treatment plan. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a cardiologist at City Hospital. She’s very good. I’ll also give you information about the hospital's financial assistance programs. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Right. Dr. Vance, you say? I’ll make a note of that. And the financial assistance… that’s good to know. I appreciate you looking into that for me. It’s… it’s a weight off my mind, to be honest. I suppose… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? Apart from the obvious… like running marathons? And… would it be alright if I called if I… if things get worse? If the nausea comes back stronger, or if I start having trouble breathing? I don’t want to bother you unnecessarily, but… it’s reassuring to know I can reach out if I need to.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. In the meantime, it's best to limit your sodium intake – avoid processed foods, fast food, and adding extra salt to your meals. And avoid strenuous activity. Gentle walking is fine, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Monitor your weight daily. Any sudden weight gain could indicate fluid retention, and you should report that to us immediately. And absolutely, please call if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms. That’s what we’re here for. Here’s my direct line. Don’t hesitate to call, even if you just need reassurance. I’m also going to order a low-sodium diet information booklet for you. The receptionist will provide that along with the referral and the financial assistance information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s… a bit frightening, to be honest, but I feel a bit better knowing what to expect. Thank you. I’ll make an appointment with Dr. Vance as soon as possible. And I’ll keep an eye on my weight, and watch out for any changes. I’ll let you get back to your patients. Thank you again for everything. And… good day to you, Doctor. .
