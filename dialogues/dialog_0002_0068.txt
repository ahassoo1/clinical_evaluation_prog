DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my… my legs. They are swelling. It started after… after the treatment for the… you know. The bad thing. It’s just… puffy, and it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing swelling in your legs that started after treatment for a previous illness. “The bad thing,” as you put it. Can you tell me a little more about that treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a long time ago now. Cancer. They gave me… pills. And then… some radiation. It was at the hospital in… in the city. I don’t remember exactly what kind of cancer, sorry. It was a while back, and I was… very sick then. It was… chemotherapy, I think? Yes, chemotherapy. Lots of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, chemotherapy and radiation. Thank you for sharing that, Sasha. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details; that treatment can be very overwhelming. And it was some time ago. So, this swelling… when did you first notice it after finishing treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It wasn’t right away. Maybe… six months? No, more like a year after I stopped the pills. It started small, just my ankles mostly. Now it’s… higher up my legs. It’s uncomfortable, you know? Like wearing tight socks all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a year after completing chemotherapy, the swelling started in your ankles and has gradually progressed up your legs. And you describe it as feeling like tight socks. Do you notice it more at certain times of the day, or after certain activities?
PATIENT: Yes! Definitely worse at the end of the day. If I… if I stand too long, it gets really bad. And… and when it’s hot. Hot weather makes it much, much worse. I try to put my feet up, but it only helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse at the end of the day, with prolonged standing, and in hot weather. Putting your feet up provides some relief, but not complete relief. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling, or any changes in the skin – like redness, warmth, or any sores?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s… heavy. Just heavy and uncomfortable. The skin… no, no redness. It feels… normal, I think. Maybe a little bit dry sometimes, but I put lotion on it. No sores, no nothing like that. Just… puffy. Very puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just a heavy feeling and puffiness. Skin feels normal, maybe a little dry. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Let me think. The doctor said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. And… and I had a little bit of trouble with my heart a long time ago, but they gave me tests and said it was okay. Mostly okay, anyway. I don't remember much else. I take a few pills, but… old age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with medication, and some previous heart concerns that were evaluated. And you’re taking a few medications. Can you tell me what medications you are currently taking, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. I have a bag at home with all my pills. I can’t remember the names. One is for the blood pressure, a little white one. And… and one for my water, the doctor said I hold too much water. And… and maybe one for my bones? I think? It’s all a bit of a mess, to be honest. I get my daughter to help me with it, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's perfectly alright. It's common to have trouble remembering medication names, especially when taking multiple prescriptions. We can look it up in the system if you're comfortable with that. Do you know the pharmacy where you usually fill your prescriptions?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s… that’s a good idea. The pharmacy… it’s… Le Fleur Pharmacy. On Main Street. A little one, but they are very nice. They know me there. They can probably tell me all the names, if you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, Le Fleur Pharmacy on Main Street. Let me just quickly check our system to see if we have a record of your medications there… Okay, I see your profile here. It looks like you are currently taking Lisinopril for blood pressure, Furosemide, which is a diuretic to help with fluid retention, and Alendronate for bone health. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes! Those names… those sound right. Lisinopril… Furosemide… and Alendronate. Yes, you are a smart doctor! It’s good to know what I’m taking, I forget so easily. So, what does this mean for my legs? Is it the pills?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. Knowing the medications is very helpful. It’s very common to experience leg swelling as a side effect of both Furosemide and, less commonly, Lisinopril. Furosemide can sometimes cause electrolyte imbalances that contribute to swelling, and Lisinopril can, in some cases, affect blood flow. Now, to get a better understanding, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just check your legs, feet, and ankles for swelling and check your pulses. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Do what you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. My legs are just… very tired. I hope you can help me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, I’m feeling some definite swelling in both of your legs, particularly around your ankles and lower calves. Your pulses are present and feel normal, which is good. I’m hearing clear breath sounds, and your heart sounds are regular, but a little bit fast. No abnormal heart sounds. Your skin is warm and dry, as you mentioned. I’m also noting some mild tenderness when I press on your ankles. Based on this exam, and knowing your medication list, it’s most likely that your leg swelling is related to your diuretics and potentially, some mild venous insufficiency - meaning the valves in your veins aren’t working as efficiently as they should. The tenderness suggests a little bit of inflammation. To rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few blood tests. We’ll check your kidney function, electrolytes, and do a basic metabolic panel. We may also want to consider a D-dimer to rule out a blood clot, just to be safe, given the tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests… so many things. But… if it will help, yes. Do what you think is best. I just want my legs to stop hurting. A blood clot… that sounds scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and you're right to be cautious about a blood clot. It's always best to rule things out. The D-dimer is a simple blood test that can help us determine if further investigation is needed. We'll also check those other levels to get a full picture. I’m going to write up the lab orders now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, which typically takes a couple of days, we can discuss a plan to manage the swelling. In the meantime, please continue to elevate your legs as much as possible, especially at the end of the day. And try to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. If you notice any sudden worsening of pain, redness, or warmth in your legs, or if you develop any chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well. Just… thank you. I hope it’s not too bad. I just want to be able to walk without feeling so tired.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I understand. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, we can get you feeling more comfortable soon. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here’s a copy of the lab orders for your records. If you think of any questions later, don't hesitate to call the clinic.
