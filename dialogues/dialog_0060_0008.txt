DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. It's… my ear, I think. Feels blocked. Full, you know? It's been… a while now. Honestly, I can't say how long. Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: A while, alright. Well, that’s… helpful. “A while” could be a few days or a few months, couldn’t it?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Months, probably. Maybe longer? I… I lost my wife a few years back, and things just haven’t been… sharp, you know? Dates, details… they all blur together. Sorry. I just want it fixed, if that makes sense. This muffled hearing is… annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Grief does… complicate things. It’s perfectly alright. We'll get to the bottom of this ear issue. So, is it just the fullness you're experiencing, or is there any pain, discharge, ringing in your ear, or dizziness accompanying it?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And… no, nothing coming out of it. Ringing… sometimes, maybe? Very faint. I mostly notice it when it's quiet. Dizzy… not really. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I think that's just… me. I'm not a tall man, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, no discharge, faint ringing… and you attribute the unsteadiness to your height. Good to know. Have you noticed any change in your hearing besides the fullness?
PATIENT: Change…? Hmm. That’s a good question. I… I don't really listen much anymore, if that makes sense. Radio’s always on, or the news. I mostly just… hear sounds. Not words, particularly. So, I couldn’t say if it’s gotten worse. Or better. It just… is. Sorry, I'm not being very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. We'll work with what we've got. So, you’ve had this muffled hearing for months, no pain or discharge, occasional faint ringing, and you haven't specifically noticed a change in your ability to hear. Any history of ear infections, or have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work or during hobbies?
PATIENT: Ear infections… as a boy, maybe? A long time ago. Nothing recent, definitely. And loud noises… well, I’m an agricultural inspector, so I’m around tractors and machinery all day. It's part of the job. Not like I choose to be blasted by noise, but… it is what it is. I don't have any hobbies, really. Not since… well.
DOCTOR: Agricultural inspector, regular exposure to machinery noise, history of childhood ear infections… Alright. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you tried anything to clear it yourself?
PATIENT: Clearing it…? No. Not really. I thought about… maybe putting some drops in it, once. But I didn't know what drops. And I didn't want to make it worse. So, no. I just… live with it. It's annoying, but… I suppose I've gotten used to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for quite some time, and you’re right to be cautious about trying things on your own. Let’s take a look at your ear, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to take a quick look. I'll need you to tilt your head slightly to the left… good. Now, the right… perfect. Hmm… yes. There's some cerumen buildup, quite a bit actually. It’s impacting your ear canal. That could very well be the cause of the fullness and muffled hearing. And… yes, the same on this side. Significant cerumen impaction. No signs of infection, thankfully. The tympanic membranes look intact.
PATIENT: Oh. Cerumen? Is that… earwax? A lot of it? And that's causing this? I… I didn't think earwax could do that. It just always… seemed to disappear on its own. So, what do we do about it?
DOCTOR: Yes, cerumen is earwax. And yes, a significant buildup can definitely cause the symptoms you’re experiencing. It’s common, actually. Sometimes the ear cleans itself out effectively, other times it needs a little help. We can remove it. I can do that in the office. It’s a fairly straightforward procedure. We’ll use a gentle irrigation system. There's also a small chance, though unlikely, that it could cause some temporary discomfort or, very rarely, a minor skin irritation. Do you have any history of ear tubes, perforations, or dizziness after ear cleaning?
PATIENT: Ear tubes…? No, I don't think so. Never had any problems with my ears as an adult, really. Just the occasional… ache when I was a boy. And dizziness… no, never after cleaning them. Or anything else, for that matter. I get a little unsteady sometimes, but that's just me, like I said. So, irrigation… that sounds… okay. As long as it doesn't hurt too much. I'm not very good with pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. We'll take it slow. It usually doesn't hurt, most people describe it as a slight pressure. I’ll let you know if I encounter any resistance or if anything feels uncomfortable. We'll start with the ear that bothers you the most. Is there one that's worse than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… difficult. I think the right one. Maybe? It’s hard to tell, honestly. They both just… feel blocked. But if I had to choose, the right one, yes. Go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m going to warm this solution slightly and then gently irrigate your right ear. It’s going to feel like a little water going in. I’ll have you sit up for a few minutes afterwards to let it drain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… warm. A little strange, but not unpleasant. A bit of pressure, like you said. I feel… something moving, maybe? It's not painful, definitely not. Just… odd. Is this taking a lot of wax out?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re feeling the wax loosening. It’s quite a bit, actually. You can see it draining now. There we go. Let me take a look… Much better. The ear canal is significantly clearer now. The tympanic membrane is visible. Still a bit of wax remaining, but it’s manageable. We can repeat this on the other side if you’d like, or schedule a follow-up appointment for further cleaning. How does it feel compared to before?
PATIENT: Oh. That… is a difference. It feels… lighter. Like there's less pressure. I can almost… hear better, I think. Very faint, but… yes. A definite improvement. Let’s do the other one, please. If you don’t mind. I’d like to see if it’s as good as this one.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get to the other ear. Just going to repeat the same process… tilting your head slightly to the left… good. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It's… similar to the other one. A little warm, a bit of pressure. I feel something moving again. Not uncomfortable at all. Actually, I think… I think this one was a little worse than the other. More blocked, maybe? It's… good, though. Getting it cleaned out is… a relief, actually. I haven't felt this clear in a long time.
DOCTOR: There we go. Let me take a look… Much better. Both ear canals are significantly clearer now. The tympanic membranes are visible on both sides. Alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Both ears are significantly clearer. Your hearing should improve over the next few hours as the wax fully drains. There’s a small chance of temporary fullness or mild discomfort, but that should resolve on its own. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. It feels… good. Much better than it has in a long time. I appreciate you taking the time to do this. It was… surprisingly pleasant. And thank you for being patient with me. I’m not always the easiest patient, I suppose. Is there anything I need to do? Or avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m glad we could get that cleared up for you. As for aftercare, just avoid getting water in your ears for a day or two. And try not to use any cotton swabs or other objects to clean your ears, as that can push the wax further in. If you experience any persistent discomfort, hearing loss, or drainage, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll document this procedure and I'll see you for a follow-up in a month just to ensure everything's still clear. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. No cotton swabs, no water… I can do that. A follow-up in a month… good. Thank you again, Doctor Nooruddin. You've been very kind. I think that’s everything. I should probably get going. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
