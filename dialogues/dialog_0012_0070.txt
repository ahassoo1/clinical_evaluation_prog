DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ah, hello. Doctor…Yoshino, yes? It’s…good to meet you too. I just… moved here. New place. Needed to find a doctor. Medicare, you know? Old age. Not like the good old days. Everything is… different now.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to want to establish care when you move, and Medicare is great—we work with them all the time. Don't worry, we'll figure things out together. And you're right, things are different! So, aside from establishing care, is there anything specific going on that made you want to come in today?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmmm… not really. Just… checking. You know. Make sure everything is… still working. I used to work with actors, putting on the… face. Lots of chemicals. Maybe that did something. I don't remember much these days, honestly. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up, and you're thinking about potential effects from working with chemicals in the past. That’s good information. When you say "not remembering much," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ah, you want details. Always details. It’s… hard to explain. Like… a fog. Things happen, then they’re gone. I might talk to someone, then forget who I talked to five minutes later. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Just… old age, probably. And stress. Lots of stress with those actors. Always wanting something different. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have details, so thank you for sharing. And it’s good you recognize it’s a change from how things used to be. Just to clarify, has this memory fog been gradual, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual…yes. I think so. It wasn’t like… bam, everything gone. More like… fading. Like a photograph left in the sun. Slowly, slowly, the colors disappear. I don’t remember when it started exactly. A long time ago, I think. I used to be very good with dates… for the actors. Reminding them when to be where. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a gradual decline in memory, with increasing difficulty remembering things, especially dates. That's helpful. Aside from the memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. What kind of symptoms? I get tired, of course. Old age. Everyone gets tired. And sometimes…my hands shake a little. But I used to work with brushes all day! Maybe that’s it. Everything is shaking these days. The world is shaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some shaking in your hands. It’s good you’re considering potential causes like the physical work you used to do. When you say “shaking,” is it constant, or does it happen more at certain times?
PATIENT: Certain times, yes. When I try to… do something precise. Like, if I try to button a shirt. Or… well, I haven’t really been buttoning shirts much lately. Too much trouble. But when I try to do something small, with my hands. It’s not all the time. Just… when I concentrate. And it's not bad shaking. Just… noticeable. Annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking that occurs with fine motor tasks, and is more noticeable when concentrating. That's good to know. Let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm… let me think. I had… something with my blood pressure, a long time ago. The doctor put me on pills. For a while. Then… I stopped taking them. Felt better. Don’t really remember what it was called. Something long and complicated. Old doctor. He was always using big words.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure treated with medication that you stopped taking. Do you recall what kind of pills they were, or even approximately when you were on them?
PATIENT: Pills? Little white ones, I think. Or maybe pink. Everything looks the same after a while. And when? Oh… maybe twenty years ago? Thirty? Time is… funny. I really don’t remember. I stopped feeling dizzy, so I stopped taking them. Seemed like a good idea at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Ah, yes. One time. When I was young. Appendicitis. Very painful. They… cut me open. Don't like hospitals. Everything is cold and smells bad. That was a long time ago. Before…the actors.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in your youth. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's… difficult. My mother… she was always very private. Didn't like talking about things. Father was… gone a long time ago. Didn't see him much. I don't really have a family history. Everyone is… gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. It's alright if you don’t have a lot of information. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you currently live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. I live… alone. Divorced. A long time ago. She… didn't like the actors either. Always complaining. I have a small apartment. Not much to it. Quiet. That’s good. Too quiet, maybe. But quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never liked it. Makes you cough. Alcohol… sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner. Sometimes. Not every day. Just… when I'm feeling… lonely. A small glass. Doesn't do much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have some… pills for my knees. They ache sometimes. The doctor gave them to me. When I first moved here. Small, blue ones. That’s it. Nothing else. Just the blue knee pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all that information, Kile. It gives me a good starting point. So, to recap, you’re experiencing gradual memory loss, some hand tremors that worsen with concentration, fatigue, a history of treated high blood pressure, an appendectomy, and you take medication for knee pain. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Blood pressure. Always checking blood pressure. It's good to check. Just… don't take too long. I get tired easily, you know. And I don't like doctors poking around. But… okay. Check. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. I’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Your reflexes are a little diminished, and your balance seems slightly unsteady. I noticed some slight tremor in your hands as well, even at rest. It’s subtle, but I observed it. All of these findings, Kile, are things that we will want to investigate further. I am concerned about your blood pressure, memory loss, and the tremor. While it could be a number of things, we need to rule out any serious underlying causes. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Underlying causes…serious causes? What kind of serious causes? Is it something bad? I don't like serious causes. All I want is to be left alone and be quiet. Is it the actors? Did all those chemicals… damage my brain?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kile, and I want to assure you that we're taking this seriously. It's too early to say definitively what’s going on. There are several possibilities, and we need to do some tests to get a clearer picture. The chemicals you were exposed to working with the actors could be a factor, but it's also important to consider other possibilities like age-related changes, medication side effects, or other underlying medical conditions. I'm concerned about the possibility of early cognitive decline, such as mild cognitive impairment or, less likely, early stages of dementia. However, it’s also possible this is simply a combination of factors, like the blood pressure and some medication side effects. To investigate further, I would like to order some blood work to check your overall health, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a more detailed look and rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI…That sounds… scary. Cutting me open again? I don't like being cut open. And blood work? Lots of needles? I hate needles. Can’t you just…give me something for my blood pressure? And maybe a pill for my memory? Is that possible? Just… something to make it all go away? I don’t want tests. I just want to be quiet.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety about the tests, Kile, and I want to assure you that the MRI does not involve cutting you open. It's a completely non-invasive procedure where you lie inside a large magnet. It doesn’t hurt at all. As for the blood work, it's just a small prick, and we can use a very small needle. I know it's not ideal, but getting these tests is the best way to understand what's going on and determine the most appropriate treatment. Simply treating your symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could mask a more serious problem. I can prescribe medication to help manage your blood pressure, and there are some medications that can help with memory, but these are often more effective when combined with a proper diagnosis and lifestyle changes. However, without knowing what's causing your memory loss, I can’t be sure which medication would be best or if it’s even the right approach. To be honest, Kile, based on your symptoms and the initial exam, I am also concerned about a possible stroke in the past. It’s not something I want to immediately jump to, but these are the reasons why I suggest these tests to rule out that possibility. Would you be willing to at least consider the blood work?
PATIENT: Stroke? Oh… no. No stroke. I don’t remember any stroke. I would remember a stroke! The blood work… Fine. Blood work. But small needle, you promised. And no cutting. Absolutely no cutting. And I want the results fast. I don't want to wait around for weeks. I just want to know. But no MRI. Absolutely not. That sounds… terrifying. Can you do something else? Something less scary?
DOCTOR: Okay, blood work it is. I promise a small needle and absolutely no cutting. And I will do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible—usually within a few days. I understand your concerns about the MRI, and I respect your decision. While it would give us a more comprehensive picture, we can start with the blood work and see what it reveals. If the blood work is inconclusive, we can discuss other options at that time. For now, I will order the blood tests and write you a prescription for a low-dose medication to help manage your blood pressure. It’s important to take it regularly as prescribed. I also recommend trying some gentle exercise, like walking, and eating a healthy diet. These can also help improve your overall health and cognitive function. Here is a referral to a neurologist for a follow up. I will personally follow up on your case. Do you have any questions for me right now, Kile?
PATIENT: Neurologist…More doctors? I just want to be left alone. No. No questions. Just… get me the pills. And the blood work. And… leave me alone. I need to go home. I need to be quiet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kile. I completely understand. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood work right away, and I’ll write the prescription for you now. Here is the prescription and the referral for the neurologist. Please call their office to schedule an appointment at your convenience. I will personally follow up on your case to review the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, Kile. And remember, I’m here to help in any way I can. .
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. .
