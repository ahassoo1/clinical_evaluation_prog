DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s… well, it’s my stomach. Been bleeding. Not a good time for it, honestly. Just… came on suddenly. It's not like a little nosebleed, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say. And it began…suddenly?
PATIENT: Yeah, suddenly. Like flipping a switch. Woke up yesterday morning and… there it was. Didn’t eat anything different, didn’t do anything different. Just… happened. It's a mess, frankly. Not something a man my age needs to deal with.
DOCTOR: Right. And can you describe the bleeding to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to describe? It's blood, Doctor. Comes out… you know… from down there. Dark stuff. Not bright red, if that matters. Like… old coffee grounds, maybe? I don't know, I'm not a doctor, am I? Is that what you need to know? The color of my blood?
DOCTOR: Yes, the color is relevant, Mr. Gentz. And the consistency, the amount… details matter. “Old coffee grounds,” as you put it, is concerning. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, it's not a pleasant topic. It comes and goes, alright? Mostly when I… try to go to the bathroom. Not a lot each time, but enough to notice. Enough to worry, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be here. And frankly, it’s none of your business how often that happens. Just tell me what's wrong, instead of asking me to describe… that.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed. Have you experienced any dizziness, weakness, or fatigue along with this bleeding?
PATIENT: Weakness? A little, maybe. I'm a bit tired, yeah. But I'm 51, Doc, and I work a… a difficult job. So, yeah, I’m tired. Doesn't mean it's related to… this. My wife… she passed last year. Been a bit rough, to be honest. Everything feels a bit… harder now. But I’m not that weak.
DOCTOR: I see. And any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I’m not going to stand here and list out everything that comes out of me, alright? It's… different, okay? Darker, stickier. Is that good enough? I'm a grown man, I know when something's not right. I don't need a doctor asking me about… that. It's embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Let's move on. Have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? No. Never. What for? I’ve always been… regular. Didn't see the point. Never had any problems before this, so why would I go poking around? Waste of time and money, if you ask me. My wife always said I worried too much about doctors. She was probably right.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications? Nothing. Never been one for pills. I don't believe in 'em. Tried some stuff for my back a few years ago, didn't do anything, just made me feel sick. Now I just deal with it. Plain and simple. Don't take anything. Not even aspirin. And I don't want to take anything, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let me just check your EHR... It appears there's no record of previous medical history. Alright. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen and a… a brief rectal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Look, are you serious? You're gonna… poke around there? After I already told you everything? No. Absolutely not. I’m not doing that. It's invasive, it’s humiliating, and frankly, it’s unnecessary. I’ve told you everything I’m going to tell you. Just tell me what’s wrong and give me something for it. I'm not sticking around for a… a proctology exam. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, a physical examination is a necessary part of determining the cause of your bleeding. I understand your discomfort, but without it, I cannot adequately assess your condition. Furthermore, given your description of dark, “coffee ground” stool, we need to rule out several serious possibilities. Without a proper exam, I cannot provide a responsible diagnosis or treatment plan. I can refer you to another physician if you prefer, but I will not proceed without a basic assessment. It is my professional obligation to ensure you receive appropriate care.
PATIENT: Look, I’m not going to argue with you. You want to poke around? Fine. Do what you need to do. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And don't go making a big deal about it. I’m a grown man, I’ve dealt with worse. Just… get it over with. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And I expect some results. Now. Doctors… always making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on your left side with your knees drawn up. I'll need to listen to your abdomen first.
PATIENT: Just… hurry up. I don't like being poked and prodded. And don't make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening for any abnormal sounds. Your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch in the lower left quadrant. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are present, but somewhat diminished. Now, I’m going to perform a quick rectal exam. Please let me know if you experience any significant discomfort. This may be uncomfortable, but it’s important for the assessment.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. I’m not going to enjoy this. Hurry up. I really don’t like this. This is ridiculous… absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright. I detect some dark, tarry stool present. The rectum is tender, and I palpate a small area of… resistance. It’s not acutely painful, but it's certainly present. Okay, that’s all. Based on my examination, and given your reported symptoms, the most likely cause of your bleeding is a lower gastrointestinal bleed. The resistance I felt could indicate a polyp, inflammation, or, less likely, something more serious. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a stool occult blood test, and a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is crucial to determine the exact source of the bleeding and rule out any malignancy. I’ll need a detailed family history, particularly regarding colon cancer or other gastrointestinal disorders. And I strongly advise against delaying this colonoscopy. It’s the best way to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? You mean… they stick a camera up… there? No. Absolutely not. I'm not doing that. I already told you, I don’t want anything stuck up there. You're talking about poking around even more? No way. What about pills? Can’t you just give me something to stop the bleeding? Something to… fix it? I don't want a camera up my… you know. It sounds awful. I'm not doing it. And don’t tell me it’s ‘crucial’. I'm not risking it. Doctors… always trying to do more than they need to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your apprehension, but refusing a colonoscopy is not a reasonable option in this case. The cause of your bleeding must be identified. Simply masking the symptoms with medication is not a solution; it could delay diagnosis and lead to a more serious outcome. I am not suggesting this lightly. Given your age and the nature of the bleeding, a polyp or even a cancerous growth is a possibility that needs to be ruled out. I cannot, in good conscience, simply prescribe medication without determining the underlying cause. I can refer you to a gastroenterologist who can discuss the procedure with you in more detail and address any concerns you may have. But I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring this could have severe consequences. Do you have any family history of colon cancer or polyps?
PATIENT: My… my mother had some kind of stomach trouble, a long time ago. I don’t remember exactly what. She… she passed away when I was young. Before they really knew about this stuff. My uncle, on my father’s side, he had something too. Something with his bowels. They… they removed part of it, I think. But that was decades ago. Honestly, I don’t know much about it. It wasn’t something we talked about. We weren’t close. Look, I just want this to go away. I don't want a camera, I don’t want surgery, I don’t want any of it. Is there anything… anything else you can do? A stronger pill? Something to stop the bleeding for good? This is a nightmare… a complete nightmare.
DOCTOR: Given your family history, your reluctance towards a colonoscopy is even more concerning. A family history of colon cancer or polyps significantly increases your risk. While I understand your apprehension, I cannot ethically provide a treatment plan that ignores this vital information. I can prescribe an iron supplement to address any potential anemia caused by the bleeding, and a medication to temporarily reduce stomach acid. However, these are merely symptomatic treatments and will not address the underlying cause of the bleeding. I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a gastroenterologist as soon as possible. They can discuss the colonoscopy procedure in detail, answer your questions, and address your concerns. I will provide you with a referral. I will also order the complete blood count and stool occult blood test to monitor your condition in the meantime. Please schedule these tests and the gastroenterology appointment as soon as possible. Your health is at stake. Do you have any questions regarding the referral or the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. A gastroenterologist. I’ll… I’ll think about it. But no promises. I still don’t like the sound of it. And what about the pills? The iron and… whatever you said? Will those at least stop the bleeding? And how long will it take to get these tests done? I don’t want to be running back and forth to the hospital all the time. This is ridiculous… absolutely ridiculous. I just wanted a simple fix. I’m going home now. I’ll… I’ll think about it. .
