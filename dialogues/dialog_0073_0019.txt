DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife, she want… baby. We old, you know? I think… maybe need help for make baby? I not so good with remember things, so she do most of talking. But we here now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… certainly a request. It’s… unusual at your age, Mr. Carlotta, but we can explore it. Just to be clear, you and your wife are attempting to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Trying. Not… work so far. She very strong woman, my wife. But maybe… old body not so strong anymore? I don't know. Is okay to try? I worry a little. It’s been… many years since last baby.
DOCTOR: It’s… possible, Mr. Carlotta, but there are significant considerations at your age. Both for your wife and for you. We'll need to gather some information. First, how old are you, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think… seventy. Yes, seventy years old. Maybe seventy-one next month? I forget the exact date. My wife, she remember more. She is… sixty-five, I think. Or sixty-six. We not so sure. It been a long time since birthdays important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been… actively trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Actively… hmm. Maybe… six months? Six months we… try. Before that, not so much thinking about baby. Just… happy. Now, she want baby before… before too late, she say. I want to make her happy. But six months, yes. Not so long, I think?
DOCTOR: Six months is a start, Mr. Carlotta. Has your wife had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Yes, she had… many babies. Five, I think. Maybe six. Long time ago. All grown up now. Grandchildren too! But… it was long time ago. She not have baby since… many years. She very good mother. But… I worry about her body now. Is okay for her?
DOCTOR: Alright. And were any of those pregnancies difficult?
PATIENT: Difficult… hmm. I remember one… she very sick, yes. Very tired. But… the others, I think, okay. Normal. She strong woman. But that one time, she stay in bed for long time. I take care of her. But… I don’t know all the details. She remember more about those things. It was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does your wife have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. She take pills for her water… her pressure, she say. The water makes her… feel funny. And sometimes her back hurt. Old age, you know? But… not so much. She strong. But she go to the doctor sometimes for the water pills. And the back. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And has she had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I think she had something on her… her tummy, a long time ago. Something small. But I don’t remember exactly. She didn’t talk about it much. It was before we met, I think. She told me a little, but I forget. I’m not good with remembering names and dates, you know? Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you or your wife have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. She not take many pills, except for the water one. And I… I don't take any pills. I eat good food, stay strong. I don’t think we have allergies. But… maybe she does? I not so sure. We never had trouble with pills before.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your medical history, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: My… history? Hmm. I work hard all my life. Make things with metal and plastic. Not easy work. Back hurt sometimes. But… I strong. I go to the doctor when I need. Nothing… big. I have the pills for my water too, sometimes. Old age, you know? But mostly… I healthy. I think. I forget all the names of the things they tell me. Just… old. I still make things, though. Still strong hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. Now, before we proceed further, Mr. Carlotta, I need to be frank with you. Attempting a pregnancy at your age carries significant risks for both you and your wife. We would need to perform a thorough medical evaluation – blood tests, potentially imaging – to assess your overall health and identify any potential complications. Are you both prepared for that?
PATIENT: Complications… hmm. Risks… yes. I understand. My wife, she very strong. But… old. I… I worry about her. But she very happy thinking about baby. If it make her happy… maybe worth the risk? I… I trust you, Doctor. If you think it safe… we can try. We want to know, yes. Is that what you mean? If it too dangerous… we not do. We just want to make her happy. But… we need to know for sure. Is that okay? .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. We will proceed with a thorough evaluation. I'll order some blood work for both you and your wife to assess your overall health, hormone levels, and identify any potential concerns. We will also need a detailed review of your wife's medical history and any previous pregnancies. I will need you to fill out these forms regarding your medical history and consent for testing. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and determine the best course of action. It's important to be realistic, Mr. Carlotta, but we will do our best to provide you with the information you need to make an informed decision. .
