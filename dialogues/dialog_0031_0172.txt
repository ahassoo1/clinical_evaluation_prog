DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, well, I just moved here, you see. A new… arrangement. And I suppose one is expected to establish a doctor. Medicare insisted, naturally. I haven’t really needed a doctor in… quite some time. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Establishing care is a good step, and we're happy to help. And no, we'll try to make this as efficient as possible. It usually involves a review of your medical history and a brief physical exam. To start with the history, could you tell me if you have any significant medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant… Well, I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Things come and go, you understand. I recall a bit of trouble with my… digestion, years ago. And my husband, bless his heart, always said I had a low tolerance for…nonsense. Is that a medical condition? Honestly, I don't recall anything serious. I keep very… composed. Is there a form I could fill out? I find it easier to write things down.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A form is a wonderful idea. It often helps to jog the memory. Here you are. It covers a lot of ground – past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies, family history, that sort of thing. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. We can go through it together afterwards. While you’re working on that, perhaps you could tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Really. I take a little vitamin D, I suppose. The woman at the grocery store recommended it. Said it was good for… bones. And something for my… water retention. It’s pink. My friend, Mildred, swears by it. Honestly, Doctor, I barely keep track of what I had for breakfast, let alone a list of… potions. Is this absolutely necessary? It all seems rather… intrusive. And frankly, I’m quite busy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Engelhaupt, and I apologize if this feels intrusive. It’s important to have a clear understanding of everything you’re taking, even seemingly harmless supplements, as they can sometimes interact with other medications or affect certain medical conditions. It's perfectly alright if you don't know the exact name of the pink supplement. If you happen to remember anything else about it – where you purchased it, what it's supposed to do – that would be helpful. But we can also focus on your past medical history for now, if that's easier. Could you tell me about any surgeries or hospitalizations you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hospitalizations… Goodness. That was a very long time ago. My tonsils, I believe. When I was a girl. And… a rather unpleasant incident with my appendix. Years and years ago. Beyond that… not that I recall. I’ve always been… robust. I pride myself on my constitution. I’ve avoided doctors for as long as humanly possible, so I likely wouldn’t remember anything dramatic. Is this truly relevant? I had a lovely garden once… a prize-winning rose bush, actually. Now that was significant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Engelhaupt. Even seemingly minor procedures can be helpful to document. And I apologize for dwelling on the past. We're just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. Perhaps we can move on to your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No. Both gone. Years ago, of course. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. Always complaining of palpitations. And my father… he was a very stern man. Healthy as an ox, but… not one for sharing his feelings. I don't recall any… hereditary illnesses, specifically. They weren’t the type to discuss such things. Rather… private people. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure all this information is necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Engelhaupt, and I apologize if it feels that way. We ask these questions to identify any potential risks or predispositions you might have, based on your family history. It helps us to tailor your care to your specific needs. If you don’t recall any specific illnesses in your family, that’s perfectly alright. We can move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I’ve always been a very… refined woman. A glass of sherry on special occasions, perhaps. But nothing… untoward. Smoking? The very idea! My husband forbade it. And recreational drugs… well, that’s simply… vulgar. Honestly, Doctor, I find these questions rather… impertinent. I’ve lived a very respectable life, and I resent the implication that I’d engage in such… behavior. Are we nearing the end of this… ordeal?
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Ms. Engelhaupt. I didn't intend to offend you. These are standard questions, and I understand your discomfort. We’re nearly finished with this part of the assessment. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I recall a rather unpleasant reaction to penicillin as a child. A rash, I believe. And… I’m rather sensitive to strong perfumes. They give me a headache. Beyond that… no. I’m a remarkably resilient woman. Honestly, Doctor, I believe this is enough. I’m quite tired, and I have a luncheon appointment. Can we conclude this now? I’m simply not equipped for extended questioning.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. We've covered a great deal of information, and I appreciate your patience. So, to summarize, you have a history of tonsillectomy and appendectomy, a penicillin allergy, sensitivity to strong perfumes, and you occasionally enjoy a glass of sherry. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general assessment. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. A physical exam? Must we? I haven't been prodded and poked in… decades. I suppose… if it's absolutely necessary. But please be gentle. I bruise easily. And… try not to take too long. My luncheon… Very well. Proceed, Doctor. But I warn you, I'm not a fan of surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this time. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a faint murmur. I’ll document that for further evaluation. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Everything seems relatively normal at this initial assessment, Ms. Engelhaupt. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the faint heart murmur warrant further investigation, but nothing appears acutely concerning. Would you be open to a simple EKG and some basic blood work to get a clearer picture of your overall health?
PATIENT: An EKG? More blood work? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming excessive. I came in for a simple check-up, not a full-scale investigation. I suppose… if you insist. But I want everything explained to me in plain English. No medical jargon, please. And I expect a prompt turnaround time. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. And please be careful with the needle. I faint easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I assure you, we’ll keep everything as simple and straightforward as possible. The EKG is a quick and painless test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. The blood work will give us information about your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and other important indicators of your overall health. We'll take precautions to ensure your comfort during the blood draw, and we’ll have someone assist you just in case. I’ll order both tests now. It will likely take a few days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable? I suppose so. What choice do I have? Very well. Schedule the appointment, Doctor. But please, keep it brief. And make sure it’s with you. I don’t want to be passed around to different people. I've had enough prodding and poking for one day. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must be going. My luncheon awaits. Do let me know when this… follow-up appointment is available. And thank you… I suppose… for your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand. I'll personally schedule the follow-up appointment and ensure it’s with me. We’ll review the results together, and I’ll answer any questions you may have. Here’s a card with my contact information. The lab results will be sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule the appointment once they arrive. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a pleasant luncheon.
