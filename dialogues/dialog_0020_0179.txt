DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, yes? It is… a pleasure. Well, it’s… the words. They don’t come so easy now. It’s… difficult to explain, really. I just… struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Words don’t come so easy,” and you're struggling to find them. That’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That is… a difficult question. It was… some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, but… slowly. Perhaps… six months? Or maybe longer. It is hard to remember details, you see. It just… crept up on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, slowly over the past six months or so. That's helpful. And has this difficulty with words affected anything specific?
PATIENT: Affected… yes. Talking, of course. It makes… conversations tiring. I find myself… stopping. Searching. My wife… she used to help. She understood. Now… it’s just… more difficult to explain things. And… remembering names. That is… a problem, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's making conversations tiring, you’re struggling to find the right words, and you've noticed difficulty with remembering names. Has this impacted your ability to do things at work or at home?
PATIENT: At work… yes. I am in… compensation. Benefits. Job… analysis. It requires… precise language. Reports. Meetings. It is… more challenging now. I have to… ask colleagues to review my work. At home… I mostly keep to myself. It is… easier that way. I do not want to… bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s impacting your work, requiring colleagues to review your reports, and you’re finding it easier to withdraw socially. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other… changes? Hmm. Sometimes… I feel… a little lost. Like… the thought is there, but the word… it escapes me. And… I am more tired than usual. Even after… a full night’s sleep. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling lost for words and increased fatigue. Those can be associated with a number of things. Do you have any history of headaches, vision changes, or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. My vision… it is not so good, but that is… old age, I think. And no weakness. I can… move everything. Walk, lift… all is normal. Except… sometimes my hands… they tremble a little. But only when… I am nervous. Or… trying to write quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no headaches, vision changes, or weakness, but some tremor in your hands when you're nervous or writing quickly. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… history. My wife… she kept all the papers. After she… passed, I… didn’t bother. I remember… high blood pressure, perhaps? And… a touch of diabetes, many years ago. But it was… well-controlled, with pills. I stopped taking them… a long time ago. I am sorry. I am not… very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Sherrell. It’s perfectly alright that you don't recall everything. We can work with what you do remember. So, high blood pressure and a history of diabetes that was previously controlled with medication. Any surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my… appendix removed, when I was young. And… a knee replacement, about ten years ago. It was… successful, I think. No… other hospitalizations. Just… the usual check-ups. I am a… simple man, Doctor. I don’t… cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a knee replacement. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I stopped… everything after my wife… passed. I didn't see the point. I know, it’s… not wise, perhaps. But… it is the truth.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, Doctor. I don’t… think so. Never had a… reaction to anything. I eat… most things. Unless it is… very spicy. But that is… a preference, not an allergy. I am… a very boring patient, am I not?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Sherrell. Every patient is different. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you think is… best. I… trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Finally, I'm going to do a brief cognitive assessment. I’ll ask you a few simple questions, if that's alright.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Questions… are fine. I… will try my best. It’s just… sometimes the words… they don’t come easily, you see. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Of course, take your time. No pressure at all. Okay, first, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… hmm. Is it… 2024? No… wait. Is it 2025? I… I am not sure. It all… seems to blur together. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It’s not uncommon to be a little unsure. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects in the room?
PATIENT: That is… a chair. And that is… a lamp. And… that is a… a door. It’s… difficult, you see? They are… right there, but the words… they take a long time to come.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That can be frustrating. Okay, last question. I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I will try my best. Please… go slowly. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Apple… table… …um… I… I can’t remember the last one. It’s… on the tip of my tongue. Something… small? Round? I apologize, Doctor. I am… failing, am I not?
DOCTOR: You’re not failing at all, Sherrell. That’s perfectly alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam I’ve performed, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, specifically with memory and word retrieval. It’s too early to say definitively what’s causing this, but it could be related to a number of factors, including age, stress, or potentially something more serious. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d also like to get a referral for a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it helps to… understand what is happening, then yes. Blood work… neurological evaluation… whatever you think is… best. I just want to… feel like myself again. I apologize for… being such a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Sherrell. We’ll work through this together. Okay, I'm going to write the orders for the blood work now. It will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any infections. The neurological evaluation will involve a more in-depth assessment of your memory, language, and cognitive function. I’ll also give you a referral to a specialist, Dr. Anya Sharma. She is excellent. I will also give you a list of resources for cognitive support and strategies to help with memory. And, Sherrell, while we wait for the results and the evaluation, try not to stress too much. Focus on doing things that you enjoy. Let’s also review some safety precautions - if you feel lost or confused while driving or doing other important tasks, please ask someone for help. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Safety… precautions. Yes, that is… sensible. I do drive, sometimes. I… will ask my neighbor for help, if I feel… unsure. Dr. Sharma… is she… nearby? And… how long will the evaluation take? I just… I don’t want to be a burden. And I apologize for all the trouble.
DOCTOR: Dr. Sharma's office is about a 20-minute drive from here, in the Meadowbrook Medical Center. I'll give you her contact information. The evaluation itself usually takes about an hour and a half to two hours, depending on the tests she needs to perform. She will call you to schedule an appointment. And you are not a burden, Sherrell. My job is to help you, and I’m happy to do so. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and you’re doing a great job. Do you have any other questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that is all. You have… answered everything. And… thank you. Truly. You have… given me hope. I apologize for my… trembling. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t apologize for anything. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood work now. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Sherrell. .
