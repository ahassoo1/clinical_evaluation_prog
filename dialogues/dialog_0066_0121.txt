DOCTOR: Hi Andrew, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Dry eyes. Been happenin’ a bit now. Feels like sand, ya know? Not real bad, but… annoying. I just wanna get it fixed quick, if we can.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dry eyes can be really bothersome, even if they're not severe. “Feels like sand” is a good way to describe it – helps me picture what you’re experiencing. And I appreciate you wanting to get this sorted out efficiently. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That’s a tough one. Maybe… a few months, I guess? Hard to say exactly. I don’t really remember a specific time. It just kinda… started being there. I work outside a lot, with the cement, so maybe that has somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: A few months, okay. And you're right to think about your work – working outside with cement definitely could be a factor. The dust and wind can certainly contribute to dry eyes. Besides working with cement, are there any other times you notice it’s worse?
PATIENT: Well… when I’m readin’. I like to read the paper in the evenin’, but my eyes get real tired then too. And… sometimes when the wind blows in the house, even with the windows closed. It’s a drafty old place.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by reading and by exposure to wind, even indoors. That’s helpful. When you’re reading, do you find yourself blinking less often, or straining your eyes in any way?
PATIENT: Straining… maybe a little. I got these old glasses, but they ain’t the newest. I dunno if that matters. I just… focus real hard on the words. Blinkin’… I guess I don't think about it much when I'm readin’. Just tryin' to see good, ya know?
DOCTOR: Right, focusing intently can definitely lead to less frequent blinking. And older glasses could be a contributing factor, too. We’ll have to check those. Let's go through some other things to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the dryness – like burning, redness, blurry vision, or feeling like something is in your eye?
PATIENT: Burning… yeah, sometimes. Not all the time, but when it's real dry, it kinda stings. Redness… I dunno, I don't look at ‘em too close. Blurry vision… just when I'm tired, I think. Not just from the dry eyes, I mean. I got old eyes! Somethin’ in my eye… no, not really. Just… dry. Really just dry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily dryness and occasional burning, which gets worse with the dryness. No feeling of anything in your eye, and redness is not a major issue. And the blurry vision is more related to overall tiredness. That’s good to know. Now, just to cover all the bases, do you have any other medical conditions – like arthritis, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Arthritis… yeah, in my hands. A little bit. Makes it hard to do some of the cement work sometimes. Diabetes… no, not that I know of. Doc never told me nothin’ about that. Never been sick much, really. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands, but no known diabetes or other major medical conditions. And you haven't been generally unwell. That's helpful. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some painkiller for my hands when they act up. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Not every day, just when I need it. And… eye drops sometimes, when it gets real bad. Just the cheap kind from the store. Don’t seem to help much, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your arthritis and some over-the-counter eye drops that aren't providing much relief. We'll definitely look at better options if needed. Let's talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have experienced dry eyes or other eye problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she always complained about her eyes gettin’ tired. But I don’t know if it was the same as this. She just said her eyes were tired. Nobody else, not that I remember. We didn't talk about much medical stuff, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had tired eyes, but not specifically dry eyes as far as you know. That’s good to know. Now, just a few lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a bad habit.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And do you spend much time in front of a computer or other screens?
PATIENT: Not really. I got a TV, of course. But I mostly read the paper, or work outside. Don't really mess with computers much. Too complicated!
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited screen time. That's helpful. Alright, Andrew, I've asked a lot of questions. I think it's time to take a quick look at your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Get it over with. Just wanna get this fixed quick, if ya can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. I'm just going to shine a light into your eyes and check the surface, and then I’ll use a couple of drops to stain the surface to see if there's any damage. It might sting a little. Okay, your eyelids look normal, no redness or swelling. Cornea is clear, but there’s some dryness evident on the conjunctiva. This will sting a little… okay. Okay, I see a little bit of staining on the conjunctiva, which confirms some dryness and irritation. It's not severe, but it's definitely there. Your pupils are equal and reactive, which is good. Your vision seems stable. So, it looks like you have moderate dry eye, likely aggravated by your work environment and possibly your age and infrequent blinking when reading. The good news is, it’s manageable.
PATIENT: Manageable, ya say? Good. What kinda stuff do I gotta do? I just wanna get some drops or somethin' and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so let's talk about treatment options. The over-the-counter drops you've been using are often just temporary relief. We can step things up a bit. First, I recommend switching to a preservative-free artificial tear. Preservatives can irritate your eyes over time, especially with frequent use. I'm going to write you a prescription for Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. Use those 4 times a day, or as needed for comfort. We can also add a gel or ointment at night to help lubricate your eyes while you sleep. That’s especially helpful if you wake up with dryness. We can try Refresh PM. Beyond drops, it's really important to focus on minimizing irritation. I'd recommend wearing sunglasses when you’re outside, even on cloudy days, to protect your eyes from wind and dust. And try to consciously blink more often when you're reading. Finally, let's talk about your work environment. Is there any way to reduce your exposure to dust and cement particles?
PATIENT: Dust… hard to avoid when ya work with cement. I wear a mask, but… it ain’t perfect. It gets in around the edges. And I mostly just gotta focus on the work, ya know? Don't really have time to think about blinkin' and stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's tough to prioritize blinking when you're concentrating on work. Okay, let's work with that. Since you're unable to fully eliminate dust exposure, we’ll focus on maximizing lubrication and protection. We can also try a warm compress on your eyelids for 5-10 minutes each day. That helps to stimulate the oil glands in your eyelids, which produces a natural lubricant for your eyes. I’m also going to write you a referral to an optometrist. They can do a more comprehensive evaluation of your eye health and check your vision in detail. It’s good to get a baseline check-up. Here’s the prescription for the drops and the referral. I want you to use the drops consistently for a week and see if you notice an improvement. If not, we can discuss other options like prescription eye drops that reduce inflammation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… alright. A lot of stuff to remember. Drops, warm compress, see the eye doctor… I’ll try my best. How much do I owe ya? I just wanna get this settled.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot to keep track of, but we’ll take it one step at a time. And you're right to ask about the cost. Since you’re uninsured, the visit fee is $120. I’m also going to provide you with a note explaining the dry eye diagnosis and treatment plan, in case you need it for any work accommodations. And I’ve included information on local resources for affordable eye care. Here are the bills and the information on resources. I want you to call my office in a week or two to let me know how you’re doing. If you’re not seeing improvement, we can revisit the plan. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just wanna get home and try these drops. Thanks, Doc. I appreciate ya tryin’ to help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Andrew. I'm glad I could help. Remember, consistency is key with the drops and warm compress. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
