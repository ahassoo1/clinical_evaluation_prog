DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 80 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, hello Doctor. Eighty, that's right… or close to it. Hmm… what brings me in… It’s this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… somewhere in my chest, I think. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it feels worse lately. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, you know? Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, memory can be unreliable at any age. You mentioned pain with deep breaths. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… It's not a sharp pain, not like a cut. More… dull. Like a heavy weight. And it feels tight, like someone’s squeezing my chest. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, though. Just… here. It hurts more when I try to take a really big breath, like when I'm trying to lift something heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long would you say this "tightness" and pain has been going on now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. A few weeks, maybe? A month or so? It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s barely there, and other days… well, like today, it’s harder to ignore. I really don't keep track of these things, Doctor. It just… is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to pinpoint exact timings. Has anything specifically made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… made it worse… Not really. I’ve been doing about the same as always. I helped my grandson with some yard work last week – some lifting, mostly. Maybe that? But I do that all the time. Honestly, I can’t say. Everything feels a little harder these days, you know? My bones ache, I get tired easily… it's hard to tell what’s new pain and what’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to rule out a few possibilities. Have you experienced any fever, cough, or shortness of breath along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don't think so. No chills or anything. I might have had a little cough last week, but it was just a tickle in my throat. Nothing bad. And shortness of breath… well, I get winded easily, but that's just from getting older, isn't it? I can still walk around, still do my things, just… slower now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Not that I've noticed. They feel a little…thick sometimes, maybe? But I always thought that was just from standing too long. I used to do a lot of work on my feet, you know, construction. It might be from that. I don't pay much attention to these things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll also feel your chest to check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just try to be quick, if you don't mind. My back isn't what it used to be, and sitting for too long makes it ache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. Lungs are clear bilaterally, although slightly diminished breath sounds. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a bit distant. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right… there. That’s where it hurts. Not all the time, but when you push on it like that, definitely. It's a dull ache, like a bruise, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the findings on examination, it could be musculoskeletal pain, possibly costochondritis, or inflammation of the cartilage in your rib cage. However, given your age and the fact that the pain is somewhat diffuse, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything… far as I recall. I haven't taken much medicine in years. Just some pain relievers for my back now and then. I’m a pretty tough old man, Doctor. Don’t break easy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… that ibuprofen sometimes. For my back, like I said. Not every day, just when it really bothers me. And… Oh, and I take a little something for my waterworks. Helps me sleep through the night, you know. But that’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: What is the name of the medication you take for your “waterworks”?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… Now that you ask… I get it from my grandson. He… he gets it for me. It’s a little blue pill, I think. I don’t really pay attention to the names, Doctor. Just take it before bed. He says it’s safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is important that we identify all medications you are taking, even those provided by family members. A little blue pill… that could be a number of things. I will need to look into that. In the meantime, I’m ordering the chest X-ray and EKG as previously mentioned. Once we have those results, we can formulate a more definitive treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, not really. You just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I just want this pain to go away. When will I get the results? And where do I go for these… X-rays and EKGs?
DOCTOR: The radiology department is located on the third floor, room 302. You can go there anytime tomorrow. The EKG will be done in the cardiology department, room 410, same building. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for them to come back. The radiology department will call you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the X-ray. Once I receive both sets of results, my office will contact you to schedule an appointment here. Here is the referral form with all of the information you will need. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Third floor, room 302 for the X-ray… Fourth floor, room 410 for the… ECG. They'll call me. My grandson can help me with all this. He's good with computers and things. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I'm ready to go now if you're finished.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you experience any worsening of your chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait for a scheduled appointment. I’ll review the results as soon as they become available. You are dismissed. .
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Emergency room if things get worse… got it. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day. .
