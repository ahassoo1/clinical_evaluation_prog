DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Well, it’s my ears, I think. They just… don't work like they used to. Folks mumble, you know? Or maybe I’m just gettin’ old. It's hard to say, really. Been that way a while now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common for hearing to change as we age. It’s good you came in to have it checked out. “A while now” is helpful, but could you tell me approximately how long you've noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... it's been... a good few years, I reckon. Maybe five? Six? It kinda snuck up on me, bit by bit. Wasn't a sudden thing, ya know? Just… quieter and quieter. Hard to follow conversations, especially when there’s a bit of noise around. I used to be able to hear a pin drop! Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Schneer. Gradual onset over five or six years is quite helpful. And you've noticed it's more difficult in noisy environments?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. A restaurant, a family get-together… forget about it! Everyone talkin’ at once, and it just… blends together. I try to follow, I really do, but it’s… exhausting. It's easier one-on-one, quiet as can be. But even then, sometimes I gotta ask folks to repeat themselves. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand that can be frustrating and even a little isolating, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly alright to ask people to repeat themselves. Now, aside from the difficulty hearing in noise, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… well, sometimes my ears feel… full? Like somethin’s blockin’ ‘em. Not painful, just… stuffy. And, now that you mention it, there’s a bit of a ringin’ sometimes. A high-pitched sound. Not all the time, mind you. Comes and goes. I figured it was just… old age again!
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schneer. The fullness and the ringing – that’s known as tinnitus – are both important things to note. Does the ringing seem to be constant, or does it come and go as you described?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. It’s not always there, thank goodness. Mostly when it’s quiet, I think. Like when I’m tryin’ to get to sleep. That can be a bit annoying, ya know? Keeps me awake sometimes. But it's not… terrible. Just a little… buzzin’ in the ears. Sometimes higher pitched, sometimes lower. Hard to explain, really. It's just there sometimes, and sometimes it's not.
DOCTOR: I understand. Intermittent tinnitus is common. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… the doctor told me somethin’ once… about my water bein’ a bit off, maybe? Not bad, he said, just somethin’ to keep an eye on. I’ve had a bit of trouble with my knees, too, gettin’ old, ya know. But nothin’ serious, nothin’ that’s needed much doin’. I don't recall anythin’ about my heart, or… diabetes, was it? No, I don’t think so. I used to work with machinery, down at the shoe factory, for years. Lots of noise, but I figured I was too tough to get sick!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. So, you mentioned some trouble with your knees and the doctor mentioned something about your “water” – do you recall if that was related to your kidneys?
PATIENT: Oh, kidneys, that sounds right! Yes, kidneys, I think that's what he said. Said somethin' about it bein' a little low, and to drink more water. I did for a bit, then I forgot, I suppose. Old age, ya know? It wasn't nothin’ serious, he said. Just keep an eye on it. And the knees… they just ache, sometimes. Arthritis, I think the doctor called it. Nothing to be done about it, really. Just gotta take it slow. Now, are we talkin' about my ears again? My mind’s wanderin’ a bit today.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We are talking about your ears, and it's helpful to have this background information. Now, have you ever had any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: Hmm… Injuries… Well, now that you mention it, when I was a young lad, I fell off a bicycle. Scraped up my head pretty good, I reckon. But that was ages ago! Never thought much of it. And down at the factory, with all the noise, sometimes things would… fly around. I got bumped on the head a few times, I suppose. Nothing serious, just little knocks. Never saw a doctor about it. Mostly just rubbed it off and got back to work. We were a tough bunch back then! It's hard to recall specifics, though. A long time ago, ya know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... I take a little somethin' for my knees, sometimes. A white pill, I think. It helps a bit with the achin'. And a little somethin’ for my “water”, like the doctor said. A blue one, I think. And... that's about it, I reckon. Nothing regular, not unless I'm feelin' particularly achy. I try not to take too much, ya know. Always worried about side effects. Now, are you sure you need to know all this? Seems like a lot.
DOCTOR: It is a lot, Mr. Schneer, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. Knowing what medications you're taking, even occasionally, is important. Do you happen to know the names of these pills, or could you perhaps bring a list with you on your next visit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names… no, I don’t think so. I just ask the pharmacist for “the white one for my knees” and “the blue one for my water”. I never paid much attention to the names, really. My daughter usually handles all that sort of thing. I suppose I could ask her to write down a list. That’s a good idea, actually. Yes, I’ll ask her. It's just… I’m not very good with rememberin’ things these days, ya know. It all gets a bit jumbled. Now, what were we talkin' about again? My ears, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schneer, we were talking about your ears. Now, before we proceed with an examination, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see… not that I know of, really. I’ve never had any trouble with food, or… anything, come to think of it. My skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s just from the cold weather, I suppose. And I sneeze a bit in the spring, but that’s just hay fever, I reckon. Nothing serious, nothin’ that a bit of fresh air can’t fix. Never been one for takin’ pills, so I haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anythin’, ya know. Now, are you ready to look in my ears? I’m a bit nervous about that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We’ll take it slowly. Now, may I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother… she had trouble hearin’ towards the end, I reckon. Always had to shout to get her attention. And my father… he was a strong, healthy man, worked with his hands his whole life. Didn't seem to have much trouble with his ears. My sister, she had a bit of trouble with her balance, but I don't think it was related to hearin’. We weren't a very talkative bunch, to be honest. Didn't spend much time at the doctor, either. Tough lot, we were. Now, are you ready to look in my ears yet? I’m a bit fidgety, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we proceed, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, smokin’… No, never. Never had much of a taste for it, to be honest. My father used to smoke a pipe, but I always thought it smelled awful. Always said it was bad for your lungs. And I worked with machinery down at the shoe factory, plenty of dust and fumes, but never smokin’. My wife… she used to have a cigarette now and then, when we went dancin’. But she didn't smoke much, either. Mostly just… social things, ya know. Now, are you ready to look in my ears yet? I’m a bit anxious about this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. That’s good to know. And I understand your anxiety; we’ll take our time. Now, before we begin the examination, let’s talk briefly about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: Oh, support… I live alone, yes. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. Had a good life, she did. My daughter… she lives nearby, thankfully. Comes to visit now and then. Helps me with the shoppin’ and such. Good girl, she is. But she’s busy, ya know? Has a family of her own. So, mostly I’m on my own. I manage. I’ve always been independent. But it can be… lonely, sometimes. Now, are you ready to look in my ears yet? I’m a bit nervous about this whole thing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schneer. It’s good to know you have your daughter nearby. Alright, let’s proceed with the examination. I’m going to use an otoscope to look into your ears. It doesn't hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. I see some cerumen – earwax – in both ears, which is common. It appears to be impacting, meaning it's building up and may be affecting your hearing. Your ear canals also appear slightly inflamed. The tympanic membranes – your eardrums – appear intact, but a bit dull. I’m unable to visualize them clearly due to the wax buildup. I'd like to remove the wax so I can get a better look. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A little cool, you said? Yes, that’s cool. Inflamed… and… dull? What does that mean, exactly? Is it bad? Remove the wax, you say? Will that hurt? I don’t like things bein’ poked around in there. Is there any other way? Now, are you sure you need to poke around in there? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned. “Inflamed” means there’s some redness and swelling in your ear canal, which can be caused by several things, including wax buildup or irritation. “Dull” refers to the appearance of your eardrum; normally, it's translucent, but the wax is obscuring the view. Removing the wax is the best way to determine the cause of your hearing loss and rule out any other problems. I can use a few different methods – irrigation with warm water, suction, or gentle scraping. The irrigation is generally the most comfortable, but it can be a little messy. I'll be very gentle, and I'll stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Would you prefer to try the irrigation first?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Irrigation… with warm water? Is it… safe? I don’t want to get water stuck in there. And I don’t want anythin’ scraped around! That sounds awful. Maybe… maybe the suction? Is that less… invasive? But what if it hurts? And what if it makes it worse? It's just… I don’t like things bein’ poked around in there, you know? I’ve always been a bit sensitive. Maybe we could just leave it alone? Maybe it'll get better on its own? Now, are you sure you need to do anythin’ at all? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly reasonable to be hesitant. Leaving it alone might improve things slightly, but the wax buildup is significant and is likely contributing to your hearing loss. It can also make it harder to perform a thorough examination if something else were going on. The suction method is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause a brief sensation of fullness or pressure in the ear. I’ll use a very small suction tip, and I’ll be very gentle. I promise to stop immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. I can also explain the procedure in more detail if you’d like. We can always stop at any time if you’re not comfortable. Would you like me to demonstrate the suction tip so you can see what it looks like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Demonstrate it, you say? Yes, that might be good. If I can see what it looks like, I might feel a bit better. But please be gentle. I've always had sensitive ears. And what if it makes me dizzy? I've heard stories about people gettin' dizzy when they have things done to their ears. And what if it makes my hearing worse? That's my biggest fear, you know? Just makin' things worse. Now, are you sure this is the best thing to do? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I understand your concerns completely. Let me show you the suction tip. Here it is. It’s very small, as you can see. It’s used to gently remove the earwax under direct visualization. It doesn’t go into your ear canal, it just sits near the opening. It's similar to using a tiny vacuum cleaner. The risk of dizziness is very low with this procedure, but it’s always a possibility. If you do feel any dizziness, we’ll stop immediately. As for making your hearing worse, the goal is to improve it by removing the blockage. I’ll be very careful and gentle throughout the procedure. Before we proceed, would you like me to explain the steps in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It does look a bit scary, doesn't it? Like a tiny vacuum cleaner… for my ear! Explain the steps, you say? Yes, that might be good. If I know what to expect, I might feel a bit better. But please be gentle, Doctor. And please stop immediately if I feel any pain or discomfort. I've always been a bit sensitive. And what if it tickles? I hate bein' tickled! Now, are you sure this is the best thing to do? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I understand your anxiety. Let me explain the steps in detail. First, I'll position you comfortably in the chair. Then, I’ll use an otoscope to visualize your ear canal and identify the wax buildup. I’ll then gently insert the suction tip near the opening of your ear canal. I will not push it deep into your ear. I will then gently turn on the suction to remove the wax. The procedure usually takes just a few minutes per ear. I will continually monitor your comfort level throughout the procedure. If you feel any pain, discomfort, or dizziness, please let me know immediately and I’ll stop. It’s also possible that it might feel a little strange or ticklish, but it shouldn’t be painful. Before we begin, do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A few minutes per ear, you say? That doesn't sound too bad. But what if it gets stuck? What if the suction gets stuck in my ear? And what if it makes a ringing sound? My ears ring sometimes, and I don't want it to get worse. And what if it damages my eardrum? I've heard stories about people gettin' their eardrums damaged. Now, are you sure this is safe? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest. I'm not sure I can go through with it. Maybe we should just leave it alone?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schneer. It’s perfectly alright to be hesitant, and it sounds like you’re feeling very anxious. Let me address your concerns one more time. The suction tip is very small and flexible, and it’s designed to gently remove the wax without causing any damage. It cannot get “stuck” in your ear. It's also highly unlikely to cause any damage to your eardrum. I will be very careful and gentle throughout the procedure, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. However, I completely respect your wishes. If you're feeling this anxious, we absolutely can leave it alone. We can explore other options, such as using ear drops to soften the wax, or we can schedule a consultation with an audiologist for further evaluation. Ultimately, the decision is yours. What would you like to do?
