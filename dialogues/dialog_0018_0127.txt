DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’ve started to droop. It’s quite noticeable, I think. It’s a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is concerning when you notice changes in your body like that. Progressive weakness and drooping eyelids—that gives us something to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started… I suppose in my legs. Just a little more tiring than usual after a day of work, you know? I’m a facilities manager, so I’m on my feet quite a bit. But it’s gotten worse. Now, it’s… harder to climb stairs, even. And lifting things feels heavier than it used to. It’s not a sudden thing, more of a gradual decline. It’s… it’s hard to describe exactly. It’s just… more effort to do things.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual increase in effort with activities like climbing stairs and lifting—that is helpful information. And it’s important you describe it as a progressive change. Could you tell me if this weakness is present more at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think it’s worse in the evening, definitely. By the end of the workday, I’m quite exhausted. It’s hard to tell if that's just from a long day, or if the weakness is actually more pronounced then. But yes, generally, it feels more noticeable as the day goes on. And in the mornings, it’s… not gone, but better. It’s just… there. Not as debilitating, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the weakness fluctuates, with a tendency to worsen throughout the day. That's useful. Now, regarding your eyelids—you mentioned they’ve started to droop. Has this been sudden, or gradual, like the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s been… gradual, I think. Like the weakness. I didn’t notice it right away. It was just… looking in the mirror one day and thinking my eyes looked a little… tired. And then my wife – well, my ex-wife – pointed it out a few weeks ago and said I looked… well, she said I looked like I hadn’t slept in days. That’s when I really started to pay attention, and realized it was getting worse. It’s not a dramatic droop, but it’s definitely noticeable. Especially in the evenings, too, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve noticed the change and that your ex-wife brought it to your attention. Noticing these subtle changes is important. To get a more complete picture, I’m going to ask a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer. A physical exam is fine too. I suppose the more information, the better, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Now, have you noticed any difficulty with your vision—blurriness, double vision, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. No, not exactly. My vision feels… normal, I think. I wear glasses, you see, so I’m used to a certain level of correction. I haven't noticed anything different with my vision, no blurriness or double vision. Sometimes my eyes feel a little strained at the end of the day, but I always put that down to staring at a computer screen all day, or maybe just general tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in your vision beyond expected strain. Have you experienced any difficulty with speaking or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty with speaking or swallowing. Everything feels… normal there, thankfully. My voice hasn't changed, and I haven’t had any trouble eating or drinking. I haven’t choked or anything like that either. That’s… a relief, at least. It’s good to know it’s not affecting everything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: No, nothing noticeable there either. Everything is… regular, for lack of a better term. No issues with either one, thankfully. I apologize if that’s a bit… personal. I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Not at all, it's important information. We need a complete picture. Now, I’d like to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing—any unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, or any other general aches and pains?
PATIENT: Let me think… No unexplained weight loss, no fever, and no night sweats. I have had a bit of a general ache in my shoulders and back, but I put that down to the physical nature of my job – constantly lifting and moving things. It’s not constant, just… sometimes, after a long day. It’s nothing severe, just… a bit of discomfort. I haven’t taken anything for it, really. Just tried to stretch and rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some mild shoulder and back discomfort related to your job. Now, let's move onto some background questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant medical illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing significant, no. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And a broken arm when I was a teenager, playing football. But nothing major. No serious illnesses, no surgeries. I’ve generally been quite healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is… concerning. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized. Not even overnight. The broken arm was treated at the doctor’s office, then in a cast. But nothing requiring a hospital stay. I've always been lucky, I suppose. Relatively good health, all my life. Until… now. It’s a little unsettling, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any medications at all. Nothing prescribed, nothing over the counter. And I don't take any supplements either. I try to eat a healthy diet, but I don’t really bother with vitamins or anything like that. I've always preferred to just… let my body be. I haven't really needed anything, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything. No food allergies, no skin reactions, no hay fever, nothing like that. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I think I’m quite lucky, truthfully. It’s… strange, to be feeling unwell when I’ve always been so healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let's discuss your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother had… arthritis, I believe. Nothing major, as far as I know. My grandparents… I didn't know them very well, so I don’t really know their medical history. As far as I’m aware, there’s no history of any serious neurological conditions or muscle weakness in the family. Nothing like that. It's… a bit frustrating, not knowing more.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to have what you do know. Now, a little about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I drink alcohol… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner maybe once or twice a week. Nothing excessive. And no, I don’t use any recreational drugs at all. Never have, never will. I lead a pretty quiet life, to be honest. Work, a bit of reading, occasionally meeting friends for coffee. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Please proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, it will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you don’t mind, please have a seat here. I’m going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength, reflexes, and coordination. I’ll also examine your eyes, just to get a closer look. First, let’s check your blood pressure. It’s 130 over 80. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function. Could you please close your eyes and extend your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here they are, palms up. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. Hopefully, this isn't too bad. I'm a little nervous, to be honest, but I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: I notice slight resistance on your left side, compared to your right. It’s subtle, but noticeable. Now, I’d like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can.
PATIENT: I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that alright? Does one feel weaker than the other? I can’t really tell, to be honest. It feels… about the same, I think, but I’m happy to try again if you’d like. It’s a little difficult to judge, really.
DOCTOR: It is subtle, but your grip strength is slightly weaker on your left side. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Your extraocular movements are full and intact. However, I do notice some mild ptosis – drooping of your left eyelid – which is more pronounced than your right. Overall, the neurological exam reveals some subtle weakness on your left side and mild ptosis of your left eyelid. These findings, combined with your symptoms of progressive weakness and fatigue, are concerning. I want to order some blood tests and possibly an imaging study to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests and an imaging study, whatever it takes to find out what's happening. I’m… a little worried, to be honest, but I appreciate you taking everything so seriously. Yes, please. Let's do whatever you think is necessary. What sort of imaging study were you thinking of? And what will the blood tests be looking for? I’m just trying to understand what we’re trying to rule out, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schaust. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. We'll start with some comprehensive blood work to assess your overall health, check for any underlying inflammation, and rule out common causes of weakness and fatigue, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. We’ll also check your creatine kinase levels, which can be elevated in muscle disorders. As for the imaging study, I’m thinking an MRI of the brain and orbits. This will allow us to visualize your brain and the muscles around your eyes, and look for any abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam findings, I’m considering a few possibilities, including myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness and fatigue, or a possible issue affecting the nerves in your eye muscles. However, it’s important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point, and we need the test results to confirm a diagnosis. I’m going to write you a referral for the blood tests and the MRI. The lab and imaging center are both located conveniently near the clinic. Do you have any questions about the tests or the referral process?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… clear enough, I think. Myasthenia gravis… I’ve heard of it, I think. Is it… serious? And how long will it take to get the results back? A few days? A week? I just need to know what to expect, you know? I have a bit of a busy schedule, so knowing when I need to follow up would be helpful. And… is there anything I should be doing now? Resting more? Avoiding strenuous activity? Just trying to manage things until we get some answers.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Schaust. Myasthenia gravis can be serious, but it is treatable. The severity varies greatly from person to person. With proper diagnosis and treatment, many individuals with myasthenia gravis can live full and active lives. The lab results typically come back within 3-5 business days. The MRI results may take a little longer, usually 5-7 business days, as they require interpretation by a radiologist. I’ll have the clinic staff contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. It’s also a good idea to avoid prolonged exposure to bright sunlight or heat, as these can worsen your symptoms. We want to minimize any potential exacerbations while we wait for the test results. I also want to emphasize that if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing – you should seek immediate medical attention. I'll write a note to your primary care physician as well, so they are aware of our findings and plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. That’s a lot to take in, of course, but I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for the note to my primary care physician – that’s very helpful. I’ll schedule the blood tests and MRI as soon as possible. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes or if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again, Doctor Stilaire. I feel… a little better, just knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schaust. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. It's always best to address these concerns proactively. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the test results with you soon.
