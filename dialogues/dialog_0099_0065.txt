DOCTOR: Right. Reneisha Selbitschka, age 41. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Overgaard. It’s… well, it’s about my weight. I’ve gained quite a bit recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my eating or exercise habits. It’s rather concerning, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Concerning, you say. Well, a lot of things can cause weight gain. It's rarely as simple as just “eating too much,” though most people assume that’s it. How recent is “recent”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… let me think. It started properly around November, I believe. So, nearly nine months now. It's not a dramatic change week to week, but it adds up. I weigh myself every Tuesday, and the number just keeps… climbing. Perhaps seven or eight pounds overall? I don’t recall the exact number, I apologize. But enough to notice in my clothes, certainly.
DOCTOR: Seven or eight pounds over nine months… that’s… not an extreme shift, but noticeable, yes. And you haven't changed your diet or exercise routine at all during that time?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not at all. I work at the hospital, you see—orderly work is quite physical, even if it doesn't feel like exercise. And my husband and I eat mostly the same meals we always have. Lots of potatoes, vegetables from our garden when they’re in season, a bit of meat. Nothing… indulgent, if that makes sense. I haven’t started any new medications either.
DOCTOR: Right. And you've always maintained this weight relatively consistently before November?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. I’ve always been… solid, you could say. Around 140-150 pounds for many years. My husband says I’m “robust”, which is a kind way of putting it. But this is…different. It’s not just a few pounds fluctuating, it’s a steady, unwanted increase. And I feel… sluggish, even for me. Not ill, exactly, just… heavier than I should.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No recent changes to medications, no new medical conditions documented… Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and feel your abdomen. Just routine, but we need to rule out anything obvious. If you could just get up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I apologize for any inconvenience. I hope you don’t mind my… size. It makes some things a bit difficult these days.
DOCTOR: Nonsense. It's my job. Just lie back, and relax as much as you can. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Thyroid feels normal, no palpable nodules. Abdomen is… soft, non-tender. No masses that I can detect. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 76. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Alright. It doesn't appear to be anything immediately obvious. Given the lack of any other symptoms, and the steady weight gain despite no changes to your habits… it could be a hormonal issue, possibly thyroid related, even though the initial exam didn't reveal anything concrete. We should run some blood tests. I'll order a complete thyroid panel, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. It’s also worth checking your A1C just to rule out pre-diabetes.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood tests are fine. Though, I must admit, I’m rather averse to needles. Is there anything I can do to…prepare myself? And how long will it take to get the results? I have duties at the hospital to consider.
DOCTOR: Aversion to needles is common. It’s a quick pinch, really. Look away, focus on your breathing. The phlebotomist is very good. As for results… typically about three to five business days. We can call you as soon as they’re available. I’ll also need to get your height and weight accurately. Please step on the scale. And I’m going to ask you some more questions, now. Family history, specifically. Any family members with thyroid problems, diabetes, or early heart disease?
PATIENT: Certainly. 162 pounds. I was hoping for better. Family history… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, but nothing more. Her mother… she suffered from some sort of… weakness in her limbs, as she got older. The doctors called it ‘nerve trouble’, I believe. No one, to my knowledge, with diabetes or heart disease. My husband’s side… his father had a strong heart, worked on a farm his entire life. But his mother… she was rather thin, and always worrying about her weight. A bit of a worrier, generally. Is that helpful, Doctor? I don’t recall much detail, unfortunately. My family doesn’t discuss such things readily.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Nerve trouble” is vague, but we'll note it. And a history of weight concerns in the family, noted. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything, but it’s good to have the complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your diet in a little more detail. You said nothing has changed, but can you give me a typical day’s meals?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal, with a bit of fruit – apples mostly, when they’re in season. And coffee, of course. Lunch is typically a sandwich – ham and cheese on rye bread – and a small salad, if I have time. Sometimes leftovers from dinner, if there are any. And dinner… my husband does most of the cooking, and it’s usually potatoes, some sort of meat – pork or chicken mostly – and vegetables. Cabbage, beets, carrots… whatever’s fresh from the garden. We don’t eat a lot of sweets, and I rarely drink soda. Perhaps a small glass of juice with dinner. I apologize for the rambling. I’m trying to recall everything precisely.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds reasonably healthy, on the surface. But portion sizes matter, of course. Are your portions… generous?
PATIENT: Perhaps. My husband is a… generous cook. He believes in hearty meals. He was raised on a farm, you see, and always made sure everyone had enough to eat. It’s a… habit. I usually eat what’s on my plate, as one should, but it’s often quite a bit. I haven’t thought much about it, to be honest. It’s just… normal. I do try to help with the cooking sometimes, perhaps I could… influence the portions a bit more. But he doesn’t always appreciate my suggestions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's something to consider. Look, it's not about blaming anyone, but we need to be realistic. It is possible to gain weight even eating what you perceive as healthy food if the quantity is excessive. For now, we'll focus on the blood tests. Once we have those results, we can determine the next course of action. I'll also have the nurse weigh you again before you leave, just to have a baseline. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your patience. I simply hope these tests reveal something… concrete. I dislike feeling… uncertain. And, if I may ask… how urgent is this? Should I be concerned?
DOCTOR: Look, it's unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, given your lack of other symptoms. However, unexplained weight gain should be investigated. We're running these tests to rule out underlying medical conditions like hypothyroidism, diabetes, or Cushing's syndrome. If it is one of those, early detection is always best. The nurse will take your blood sample now. We'll call you as soon as the results are in, usually within three to five business days. In the meantime, try not to worry unduly. Do you have any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I walk perfectly well. Though, I do tire more easily than I used to. Thank you again for your time. I look forward to hearing from you. I shall attempt to be… mindful of my portions, as you suggested. .
