DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Paes, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Pehrson. It's... my skin, mostly. It's been getting darker, and I've just been so tired lately. It's not like a normal tired, you know? It's…deeper than that.
DOCTOR: Darker skin and fatigue. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. The tiredness…probably a good six months, maybe a little longer. But the skin darkening? That's newer. Maybe three or four months. It started on my hands, I think, and now it’s…well, everywhere, really. Not all over, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Six months of fatigue, three to four months of skin changes. "Everywhere" is…vague, Ms. Paes. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry. Yes, you're right. It's on my face, my neck…my arms, and my legs, mostly. And like I said, started on my hands. It's not patchy, it’s just…everything’s a few shades darker than it used to be. It’s hard to explain. I haven’t been spending any more time in the sun, that’s for sure. If anything, I’m avoiding it!
DOCTOR: Avoiding the sun…right. And have you noticed any itching, burning, or any other changes to the skin besides the darkening?
PATIENT: No, no itching or burning. It doesn’t feel different, just…looks different. It’s kind of worrying me, because I haven’t changed anything in my routine. Same soaps, same lotions…same everything, really. And I feel so run down all the time, even when I get enough sleep – which isn't often, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about this fatigue. On a scale of one to ten, one being barely noticeable and ten being completely debilitating, where would you rate it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm…probably a six or seven, on most days. It’s not like I can’t do things, I still go to work and everything. But I come home and just…collapse. And I have no energy to do anything I want to do. I used to love gardening, but I just don't have the pep for it anymore. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Ms. Paes?
PATIENT: I work at the chemical plant, downtown. I'm a Chemical Plant and System Operator. It's… a lot of monitoring and making sure everything runs smoothly. It’s not super physical, but it's a lot of responsibility, and sometimes the shifts are long.
DOCTOR: Long shifts, responsibility…okay. And do you notice any swelling in your hands or feet, Ms. Paes?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it…yes. Just a little. Not bad, but my rings feel a bit tighter sometimes, especially at the end of a long shift. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. It's been pretty warm lately.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's take a look at your skin. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. And please, try to be as still as possible.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I can do that. Hopefully you can figure out what’s going on. It's just… unsettling to feel this tired and see my skin changing like this.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears hyperpigmented, particularly on the dorsal hands and around the neck. No obvious lesions or rashes noted. Slight edema in the hands, consistent with your report. Palmar skin appears normal. Okay. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 140/90. Pulse is normal. Let's run some basic blood work. Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your iron levels.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Iron levels… I haven’t really thought about that. I don’t eat a lot of red meat, if that matters. Is that…a common thing? Being tired and skin changes from low iron?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. But fatigue and skin changes are very nonspecific. A lot of things can cause them. The blood work will give us a starting point. We'll also want to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order these tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take a bit of your blood, and it should take about fifteen minutes. Once the results are back, we can discuss them. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex. That’s good, right? I'm just…a little nervous, honestly. It's just frustrating not knowing what's wrong. Fifteen minutes, okay. I'll go down to the lab then. Is there anything I should do before the test? Like, should I drink water or…anything?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just try to relax. And try not to worry too much. It's probably nothing serious. The lab technician will guide you through everything. Just let them know I sent you. Go ahead, and we’ll talk when you get back.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll see you when I get back.
