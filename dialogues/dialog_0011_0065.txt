DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Neppl. The pleasure is mine, though I confess I’d rather not be here, if I’m honest. I’ve been… gaining weight, and it’s quite perplexing. It’s not as simple as eating too much, you see. I eat much the same as always, and yet… well, the numbers on the scale keep going up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s certainly frustrating when weight gain occurs without an obvious cause. We'll work to understand what might be happening. To start, could you tell me approximately how long you’ve been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… let me think. Approximately six months, I would say. Perhaps a little longer. It was subtle at first, a tightness in my clothes, but now it’s… noticeable. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise routine, so it really is quite baffling.
DOCTOR: Six months, alright. And would you describe this weight gain as steady, or has it been more in bursts?
PATIENT: It's been… steady, I think. Not large jumps, thankfully. Just… a gradual increase week by week. It's not like I woke up one morning significantly heavier. More like… a slow creep. It's unsettling, because I haven’t altered my habits at all.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, perhaps. I've been feeling… rather tired lately. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And a bit… colder, I suppose. Not ill, exactly, but just… perpetually chilly. I attributed it to the summer being unusually cool, but perhaps it's connected. Is that… normal with this sort of thing?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and feeling cold can be associated with several underlying conditions, yes. Thank you for mentioning those. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed as a child, and I broke my arm once – a silly fall from a tree. But no ongoing illnesses, no. My husband always says I’m remarkably healthy, though I suspect he just wants me to continue doing all the gardening. I’ve never been one for doctors, so I don't have a long list of ailments to report.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries besides the tonsillectomy and the arm fracture?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just those two. Nothing else at all. I've always been very careful, and try to avoid anything that would require a visit to the hospital if possible. My mother always said hospitals were filled with germs, and I suppose that stuck with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a bit more difficult. My parents… both lived to a good age, thankfully. My father had some trouble with his heart in his later years, but nothing specific that was inherited, as far as I know. My mother was very healthy, always active. I believe my grandmother on my father’s side had… something with her blood sugar? But I’m not certain, and it was a long time ago. We weren’t close, and family medical history wasn’t something we discussed openly. I apologize for being vague, it’s not something I’ve ever had cause to remember in detail.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Selbitschka. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. We’ll proceed with what you have. Now, could you tell me a little about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, I do a fair amount of gardening. It keeps me active, I suppose, though it’s hardly strenuous exercise. I also do some housework, of course. My husband, Viktoras, and I are both retired now. He enjoys woodworking, and I… well, I enjoy keeping things tidy and making sure he has a good meal. We live a quiet life, mostly. Not much excitement, thankfully. We eat a fairly traditional Lithuanian diet - lots of potatoes, some meat, vegetables when they’re in season. I try to bake bread from scratch whenever I have time. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: That is very relevant, Ms. Selbitschka. Thank you. And do you currently take any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I pride myself on avoiding them whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I need anything at all, and so far, I haven't needed much. A little chamomile tea for sleep, perhaps, but nothing regular. Viktoras takes something for his blood pressure, but that’s the extent of it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very careful with what I eat, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat shellfish, nuts, everything really. My husband jokes that my stomach is made of iron. So, no allergies to report, thankfully. Is that all, Doctor? I must admit, I’m starting to feel a little anxious. I’d very much like to know what you think might be going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Selbitschka, that's very helpful. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and take your blood pressure and temperature. Just a routine check to help me get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not terribly fond of doctors’ examinations, but I suppose I understand it’s part of the process. Please be gentle, Doctor. And… could you explain what you’re doing as you go along? It helps to… alleviate my anxiety, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. I will be as gentle as possible and explain everything as I go along. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just to check for any unusual sounds. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid gland, which is located in your neck. This helps regulate your metabolism. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No nodules or tenderness. Your blood pressure is 135/85. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly so. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your weight. Your weight is 83 kilograms, or 183 pounds. And your height is 155 centimeters, or approximately 5’1”. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Everything appears normal on the initial physical exam, but the weight gain and fatigue warrant further investigation. I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not particularly fond of needles, but I understand it’s for the best. What exactly are we looking for, Doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do hope it won’t be too long. I’m anxious to put this all behind me.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Selbitschka. We're looking for any abnormalities in your thyroid hormone levels, as an underactive thyroid can cause weight gain and fatigue. We'll also check your blood sugar to rule out diabetes, and your cholesterol levels as part of a general health assessment. The blood work should take approximately one to two business days to come back from the lab. Once I have the results, I will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I would recommend maintaining your current diet and exercise routine. Avoid any drastic changes until we have more information. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. One to two business days… I suppose that’s acceptable. Maintaining my routine… yes, I can do that. I must confess, I’m still rather worried. What if it is something serious? What if it requires… unpleasant treatments? Perhaps you could just… reassure me that it’s likely nothing too concerning? It would put my mind at ease, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Selbitschka, and it's perfectly natural to feel anxious in this situation. While we can't know for sure until we have the blood work results, the symptoms you're describing can often be caused by relatively minor issues that are easily treatable. An underactive thyroid, for example, is often managed with a simple daily medication. It's also important to remember that we're being proactive here. By getting these tests done, we're taking the first step towards understanding what's going on and ensuring you receive the appropriate care. I want to reassure you that I will explain everything thoroughly once we have the results, and we will work together to develop a plan that's best for you. Here's what I'd like to do. I'll give you a lab requisition form for the blood work. The lab is located at [mention local lab address]. They’re open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. Fasting is recommended for this test, so please refrain from eating or drinking anything for at least eight hours beforehand, except for water. Do you have any questions about getting the blood work done?
PATIENT: Eight hours… yes, I can manage that. The lab address… let me write that down. [mention local lab address]… Yes, got it. No, I don’t think I have any further questions about the blood work itself. Just… try to remain calm, you said? I shall try my best, Doctor. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea will help. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. It… does ease my mind somewhat. I suppose that’s all for now then? I shall see you in a couple of business days. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. Chamomile tea is an excellent idea. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a pleasant day, and try not to worry too much.
