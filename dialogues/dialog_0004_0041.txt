DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. My legs… they just don’t feel as strong as they used to. It makes walking a little… difficult, especially if I try to do too much. My wife, she’s been very helpful, but… I want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness, you say. And it's progressively worsening, making walking difficult. Alright. To get a better understanding, can you tell me where exactly are you feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it started in my right leg, I think. It just felt… heavy, sometimes. Now… now it’s both legs, mostly. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… tired. And it goes up a little into my hips, sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It’s not always there, you see. Some days are better than others.
DOCTOR: “Tired” weakness, fluctuating in intensity… and present in both legs now, originating in the right. Do you notice it more with certain activities?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Walking, like I said. But… standing for a long time, too. Even just getting up from a chair sometimes. It’s worse when I’m tired, of course, but even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep, it can still be there. My wife says I shuffle a little when I walk… I don’t really notice it myself, but she has a good eye.
DOCTOR: Wives always do. Alright. And has this weakness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… yes. My vision, it gets blurry sometimes. Not all the time, but… enough to worry me. And… I forget things more easily now. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I was going to say. It’s… frustrating. My wife says I repeat myself sometimes too. I don't always remember saying it the first time, you see.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, memory issues, repetition… Hmm. Let’s review your medical history. I see you have a history of hypertension, well-controlled, and hyperlipidemia. Any other significant medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bad bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. And… oh, yes. They told me, about ten years ago, I have… Multiple Sclerosis. That’s what the specialist said. I haven’t seen him in a while, to be honest. Things were… okay for a long time. But now… this weakness is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Multiple Sclerosis, and you haven't followed up with a neurologist in ten years?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I didn't think I needed to. Things were stable, you see? I was managing. I’d get tired sometimes, of course, but… I thought that was just getting older. It wasn’t until this weakness started getting worse that I decided to come see someone. I didn’t want to bother the doctor if things were alright.
DOCTOR: “Bother the doctor”?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s not what I meant. It’s just… I didn’t want to take up his time if it was nothing. My wife, she told me I should come, but… I kept putting it off. I thought maybe it was just a bad spell. You understand? I didn’t want to worry needlessly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, with a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, any change in your condition warrants a medical evaluation. It’s… irresponsible to delay care. Alright. Let’s proceed with a neurological exam to assess your weakness, reflexes, and coordination. And I’ll need to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes and to get an updated picture of your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. No allergies that I know of. That sounds… good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just… I hope it’s not too serious. My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s begin. Please follow my instructions carefully. I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can… now resist as I try to move your arms… Good. Now, let's check your legs. Please relax your legs…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m trying my best. It’s a little harder than it used to be, but I’m doing what you ask. My leg feels… funny. A little numb, maybe. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Numbness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not all the time. Mostly in my feet, and sometimes up my ankles. It’s not a sharp pain, just… not feeling everything, you see? Like wearing thick socks. It's worse on my right side, I think.
DOCTOR: And what about your balance, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: Oh… my balance isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I’ve been a little unsteady on my feet lately. My wife, she holds my arm sometimes when we walk, just in case. I don’t fall often, but… I feel like I could at any moment. It’s a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are diminished bilaterally, particularly in your lower extremities. Your gait is wide-based and slightly unsteady. Based on this preliminary examination, and your history of Multiple Sclerosis, I strongly recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation, including an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. We need to assess the current activity of the disease process. In the meantime, I'll order blood work to rule out other contributing factors and to get a baseline assessment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI, you say? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it bad? I’m a little worried now. I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that, but… what does this all mean? What if it’s worse than before?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, an MRI is a diagnostic tool. It provides information. It doesn’t indicate severity. It simply allows us to visualize what is happening inside your brain and spinal cord. Given your history, changes are expected. The important thing is to determine the extent of those changes and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. To be clear, I am not making a definitive diagnosis at this point. The neurologist will interpret the results of the MRI and provide you with a comprehensive assessment. I am ordering blood work now. It's best to address this proactively. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I understand. Proactively. That sounds… good. I just… I don’t like the idea of more tests. But if you think it’s best… then I trust your judgment. Will the neurologist contact my wife, or should I schedule the appointment myself? And… how long will it take to get the results from the blood work?
DOCTOR: You should schedule the appointment yourself, Mr. Astore. It’s best to be directly involved in the process. I will provide you with a referral and a list of neurologists in the area. As for the blood work, the results typically take 2-3 business days. Once they are available, my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you taking a look at me. I’ll call and schedule the appointment with the neurologist as soon as I get home. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My office will provide you with the necessary paperwork. Have a good day, Mr. Astore.
