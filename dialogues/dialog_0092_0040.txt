DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think you’d call it. It keeps coming back, and with it, these water infections. The nurse said something about my kidneys, but I’m not quite sure what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, that gives me a starting point. Flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections. We’ll definitely look into that. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but when it’s there, it’s quite uncomfortable. It feels deep inside, on my back, just below my ribs. Sometimes it radiates around to my stomach. It's usually on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Dull ache, radiating from the flank to the abdomen, sometimes on the right, sometimes on the left. And you mentioned it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It’s not constant, thankfully. It might be okay for a few weeks, then come back for a few days. It seems to flare up when I drink a lot of fluids, or when I’m a bit… constipated, if you don’t mind me saying. That usually makes it worse. And of course, with the pain comes the burning when I go to the toilet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's intermittent, worse with increased fluid intake and constipation, and accompanied by dysuria – burning with urination. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain and urinary issues?
PATIENT: Dysuria… is that the burning, Doctor? Yes, that’s it exactly. Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, just generally run down. And I’ve noticed my ankles have been a bit swollen lately, but I thought that was just old age catching up with me. I’m not sure if that’s connected, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for telling me, Mr. Espinueva. Fatigue and ankle swelling are important to note. Let's get a bit more information. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting with these episodes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, nothing like that. I haven’t been sick to my stomach either. It’s just the pain, the burning when I pee, and feeling a bit tired. It’s… unpleasant, but I haven’t felt properly ill, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. No systemic symptoms like fever, chills, nausea or vomiting. That's good to know. Now, have you had any issues with kidney stones or urinary tract infections in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve had a few water infections over the years, nothing major. The doctor always gave me some pills, and they’d clear up. But kidney stones… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had anything removed, and no one ever mentioned them. I remember my mother having some trouble with her kidneys when she got older, but I don’t know what exactly was wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of recurrent UTIs, mother had kidney issues, but no personal history of kidney stones. Let's talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've always been quite healthy, to be honest. I used to work outdoors a lot, which kept me fit. I don’t take any regular medications, apart from a bit of paracetamol now and then for aches and pains. The nurse asked me about allergies, and I don’t have any that I know of.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you've been generally healthy. No chronic medical conditions, no regular medications, no known allergies. That simplifies things. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let's quickly go over your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner, but I cut that out a few years ago. And no, I don’t take any drugs. Just a bit of tea, if you don't mind. And maybe a biscuit or two with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Just tea and biscuits. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your flanks for tenderness, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I’m noting some tenderness in your right flank, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Your bowel sounds are normal. Your blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your ankles for edema. I do see some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect we're dealing with a recurrent urinary tract infection, potentially complicated by some mild kidney involvement and possibly some early signs of fluid retention. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. Would you be able to provide a urine sample now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that now. A urine sample, you say? No problem at all. I was expecting something like that. So, you think it’s my water infection again, and maybe something with my kidneys? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s possible it’s a recurrent UTI with some kidney involvement, Mr. Espinueva. It’s good you're asking about the seriousness. While recurrent UTIs aren't usually life-threatening, they can indicate an underlying issue and, if left untreated, can lead to kidney damage. We need to rule out a kidney stone, assess kidney function, and ensure there isn't a more serious infection. The urine analysis will help us look for bacteria and blood, and the complete blood count will give us a better picture of your overall health. If you could provide a sample, and then we'll discuss next steps once the results are back. Do you need any assistance with providing the sample?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I can manage. I’ve done this before, unfortunately. Just let me know if you need me to wait anywhere specific. I’ll just go and use the restroom now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. Please take your time. The restroom is just down the hall to the left. I'll be here when you're finished. I’ll also have the nurse draw some blood for the complete blood count while you're in there. We'll review the results together as soon as they're available.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, thank you very much. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll be back shortly with the sample.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll be right here.
