DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. Uber, Lyft… things like that. I want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. I don’t want any trouble with the law, you see. I hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarotta. You’re referring to a medical examination to ensure you meet the requirements for commercial driving – specifically for ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. That’s perfectly reasonable, and we can absolutely help with that. It’s good you're being proactive. To clarify, are you currently driving for these services, or are you planning to start?
PATIENT: Planning to start. I just retired, you see, from logging. Been doing that for… well, a long time. Wanted something to keep me busy, and I enjoy driving. But I read online you need a special card now, and I thought it best to get it sorted before I actually start driving people around. Don't want to get fined or anything. Is this a big exam? I’m not very good with… tests.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Mrs. Sciarotta, to get everything in order beforehand. And yes, you’re right to look into the requirements. It's a standard medical examination, often referred to as a DOT physical, even though it's not strictly a Department of Transportation exam in this case. It’s not a difficult exam, thankfully. It’s primarily to ensure you meet certain physical standards for safe driving – things like vision, hearing, blood pressure, and basic mobility. We’ll also review your medical history to identify any conditions that might impact your ability to drive safely. I’ll be sure to explain everything as we go. To begin, let’s go through your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That doesn’t sound too bad. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago now? And I’ve got a little arthritis in my knees, the doctor gave me some cream for it. Nothing major, really. I take a blood pressure pill every day, too. Just a small one. Oh, and I used to have asthma, but it’s been… well, it hasn't bothered me in decades. I haven’t used an inhaler since I was a young woman. Do you want me to list all the pills I take? I have them written down somewhere…
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Sciarotta, thank you. Knowing your medical history is very important. Yes, please, if you could share the list of medications you're currently taking, that would be great. And it's good to know your asthma is well-controlled – that's excellent. Regarding the arthritis, does it affect your ability to comfortably operate the pedals or steer?
PATIENT: Here we go. Let’s see… Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. That’s the blood pressure pill. And… that’s it, actually. Just the one. And no, the arthritis doesn’t really bother me driving. It gets a little stiff sometimes, especially in the cold, but I can still move my legs just fine. I can get in and out of the car alright, too. I do need to warm up a little, maybe, but I don't have any trouble with the pedals or steering wheel. I’ve been logging my whole life, you see. You need to be pretty nimble to do that job. Not as nimble as I used to be, mind you… but still alright.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mrs. Sciarotta. Lisinopril is a common medication for blood pressure, and it sounds like you're managing it well. And it's reassuring to hear that the arthritis isn’t significantly impacting your mobility. Now, let’s talk about any allergies you might have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not really, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a child, but I haven't been stung in… oh, goodness, fifty years. I don't carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I eat everything, pretty much. And I haven’t reacted badly to any medication, as far as I can remember. I’ve had so many shots over the years… logging is a dangerous job. I’m pretty sure if I was allergic to something, I would know it by now. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not forgetting anything…
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mrs. Sciarotta. No known allergies is good information. And you're right, if you had a significant allergy, it's likely you would remember it. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And my father, he had… well, I think it was heart trouble. He died when he was fairly young, actually. I have a brother, but I haven’t seen him in years. He’s… not very healthy, let’s just say that. He has diabetes, I think. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had arthritis. Terrible arthritis. I suppose I got that from her. Is that enough? Do you need to know more? I’m not very good with remembering dates, you see…
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mrs. Sciarotta. Knowing about the high blood pressure, heart trouble, diabetes and arthritis in your family is good information. We don't need to get into specific dates, just a general understanding of the family history is sufficient. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I'm going to check your vision, hearing, blood pressure, pulse, and a basic neurological assessment. I will also listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with, shall we? I don’t like sitting around too long. The sooner it’s done, the better. Just tell me what to do. I hope I pass… I really want to do this ride-sharing thing. It’ll keep me busy, you see. And I do enjoy driving.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarotta. I understand. We’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. First, let's start with your vision. Could you please read the letters on this chart, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Alright. Let’s see… …E… H… G… Oh, that’s a tricky one… V… and… uh… N… Is that right? It’s a little blurry, to be honest. I haven’t had my eyes checked in… well, a long time. I should probably get new glasses.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Sciarotta. It is a little blurry, and you’re right, it might be time for a new prescription. Your vision is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left. That's below the standard for commercial driving, which requires 20/40 vision in each eye, with or without correction. We'll need to get a corrected vision reading, so I'll have you wear any glasses you use for distance. Do you have them with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s not good, is it? I knew I should have brought them! …Oh, wait! Here they are. Are these the right ones? They're for reading, mostly. I don't usually wear them when I'm driving. But I do have a pair for distance at home. I just forgot to bring them. Would those make a difference? I'm so sorry, Doctor. I’m a bit of a scatterbrain, you see…
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Sciarotta, don't worry about it. It happens. These reading glasses likely won’t be sufficient for the vision test, as we need to assess your distance vision. We’ll need to schedule a proper eye exam with an optometrist to get an accurate corrected vision reading. For now, let’s move on to your hearing. I’m going to put these headphones on you and play some tones at different pitches and volumes. Please let me know when you hear each tone. Can you confirm you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Headphones, and I tell you when I hear the tones. I used to have pretty good hearing, working in the logging industry. Lots of loud noises. Hopefully, it hasn’t gotten too bad. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please tell me if you hear anything, even if it’s faint. Okay, Mrs. Sciarotta, your hearing is within normal limits for conversational speech in both ears. That’s good. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure. That always makes me nervous. It goes up when I’m worried, you know. Just try to be quick, Doctor. And don't tell me the number, if you can help it. I don’t like knowing. It just makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarotta. I understand. I will keep the readings to myself for now. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 148/92. It's not drastically high, but it's above the recommended limit for commercial driving, which is typically below 140/90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Let's proceed with the remainder of the physical exam. Could you please extend your arms out to the sides?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? That’s not good, is it? I knew I shouldn’t have gotten nervous. I do take a pill for it, you know. Lisinopril. Maybe I need a higher dose. I don't know. Just get it over with, Doctor. I'm starting to feel a bit faint. I haven't had breakfast yet, you see…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just check your reflexes now. Could you please let your legs hang loosely?
PATIENT: Alright. Just be gentle, Doctor. I've worked hard my whole life, you see. These legs have carried me a long way. I don't want to pull anything. And please, hurry. I'm starting to feel quite weak. I really should have eaten something before I came…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sciarotta. That wasn't bad at all. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Mrs. Sciarotta, based on this preliminary examination, it appears we have a few things that need to be addressed before you can meet the requirements for commercial driving. Your vision needs to be corrected and verified by an optometrist, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Given your statement about feeling weak, it would also be prudent to check a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Would you like me to provide you with referrals for an eye exam and blood work?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I knew it. I just knew it. I should have just stayed home. I’m too old for this. Yes, please. Referrals for the eye exam and the blood work. I suppose I have no choice. I really wanted to do this ride-sharing thing. It would have been nice to keep busy… But I guess it’s not meant to be. Is there anything else? Or can I go home now? I'm really not feeling well. And I really need some breakfast.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarotta. I understand your disappointment, but it's important to ensure your health and safety, and the safety of others. These referrals are just a precaution, and we can reassess once we have the results. I’m also going to recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results and see how you're feeling. Here are the referrals for an eye exam with Dr. Emily Carter and blood work at San SCIARROTTA lab. I’ve also printed a sheet with some information about managing your blood pressure, including dietary recommendations. Before you go, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I'll just have to take it one step at a time. It’s just… disappointing. I really wanted to do something different. Thank you again, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been very kind. I think I'll just go home and have some breakfast. And try not to think about it too much. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And please, do take care of yourself and get some breakfast. Have a good day, and we’ll see you in two weeks.
