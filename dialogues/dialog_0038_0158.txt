DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Auelua, was it? Yes, lovely name. Honestly, I can't even recall why I made this appointment. Something about a… a letter? For a pet, I think? My niece, bless her heart, she probably booked it for me. She's always fussing over something or another. It's probably about getting permission to have one. I just… don’t remember the details. A dog, maybe? Or a cat? They're all the same, aren't they? Shedding everywhere.
DOCTOR: It happens! It’s perfectly alright if you’re a bit unsure. Let’s see… Ah, yes. It looks like your niece booked this appointment for a request to keep a pet – specifically, a support animal. It seems a little paperwork needs filling out, and I just need to assess whether a support animal would be beneficial for your health. Do you mind telling me a bit about why you think a support animal might be helpful?
PATIENT: A support animal? Oh, that sounds…fancy. Honestly, Doctor, I don't think anything. My niece probably read something online about it. She's always on that internet. I don't have any…problems, not really. I just…get a little lonely sometimes, I suppose. Being divorced and all. It's quiet in the house, that's all. Is that what they need a letter for? Just…quiet? Seems a bit much, doesn’t it? All this paperwork for a bit of quiet.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like a bit much at all if it’s impacting your well-being, Deloris. Loneliness can definitely have an effect on your health. And a companion animal can be incredibly helpful for that. It’s good you’re exploring options. Just to get a better understanding, how long have you been feeling this loneliness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. Since…well, since the divorce, I suppose. It's been…a few years now. Five, maybe? Six? Time just…blurs, you know? It's not like I sit around crying all day, if that's what you're asking. It’s just…there’s an emptiness, I suppose. I try to keep busy, but…it’s not the same, is it? I used to have a very active social life, but…well, people move on, don’t they? It’s just me now, mostly. And the television. A lot of television.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds challenging, Deloris. It’s very common to feel that way after a significant life change like a divorce. And it’s good that you're aware of it and wanting to find ways to feel better. Besides the feeling of emptiness, have you noticed any other changes in your mood, sleep, or appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think…sleep, yes. I don't sleep as well as I used to. I wake up a lot in the middle of the night, just…thinking. And I don't have much of an appetite, really. I eat because I know I should, but I don’t enjoy it, if that makes sense. Everything just tastes…bland. I've lost a bit of weight, probably. I haven't bothered to weigh myself, though. Not one for fussing over things like that. It’s all just…getting older, I suppose. Everything slows down, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does sound like you’ve been going through a lot, Deloris. Changes in sleep and appetite, along with a loss of enjoyment in things, can definitely be signs of something more than just “getting older,” as you put it. While a companion animal could be helpful, it's also worth ruling out other potential causes for how you're feeling. Do you have a history of anxiety or depression, or has anyone in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking complicated questions, Doctor. Family history… that’s a tough one. My mother was always a bit…melancholy, I suppose. She kept to herself a lot. And my aunt, on my father's side, she was… in and out of hospitals a few times. I don't know what for, exactly. It wasn’t something we talked about much. As for me… I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, if that's what you mean. I get sad sometimes, like anyone does, but I wouldn't say I'm…anxious. Just…tired. And lonely. Is that close enough? I don’t really like labels, you know? They just…stick. And they don't really tell the whole story.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. You're right, labels don't always tell the whole story. It sounds like you’ve been carrying this for a while, Deloris, and it’s good you’re finally addressing it. To get a better picture of your overall health, would you mind if I ask about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now there's a question. Medical history… I go to the doctor when I need to, of course. Yearly check-ups and all that. Nothing major, really. High blood pressure, the doctor says, but it’s controlled with medication. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that was… well, a long time ago. I don't remember exactly when. And my knees ache, especially when it rains. It's just getting old, Doctor, I keep telling you. I've always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I try to eat right, even if I don’t always enjoy it. And I walk when I can. Just short walks, though. I'm not one for strenuous activity. Does that help? I feel like I’m rambling now. Is this what you do at the doctor? Just ask questions? It’s a bit… exhausting.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Deloris. This is what I do – gather information so I can best understand your health and how to help. And it sounds like you do take good care of yourself, despite everything. You mentioned high blood pressure and having your gallbladder removed. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or for any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure. Let me see… This little one, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Ten milligrams. Once a day, in the morning. And that’s it, really. Just the blood pressure pill. I used to take something for my cholesterol, but the doctor said it wasn't necessary anymore. He just keeps adding and taking away pills. It's all a bit confusing, if I'm honest. I try to remember, but I'm not very good with names, you know? I just ask my niece to refill them for me when I run out. She’s very organized. Much more so than I am.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you have a good support system with your niece. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shellfish, but I don't think it's a proper allergy. More of a…sensitivity, I suppose. And I try to avoid bees, of course. Nobody likes bees. But no serious allergies, no. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything dramatic like that. My mother was allergic to… something, I think. Pollen, maybe? She always stayed indoors in the spring. But I seem to have escaped all that. I’m fairly robust, all things considered. Though, admittedly, I’m feeling a bit less robust these days. All this talking has worn me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Deloris. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and take a look at your knees. It will only take a few minutes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I don't particularly enjoy being poked and prodded, but I suppose it's part of the process. Just be gentle, Doctor, alright? My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I don’t want to make them worse. And please don’t tell me I need to lose weight. I’ve heard it all before. Just a quick listen and a quick poke, you said? Alright, then. Let's get it over with. But don't take too long, alright? I have my stories to watch, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Quick and gentle, I promise. And no weight talk, I assure you. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, deep breath in…and out…good. Again…and out… Heart sounds are regular, a bit of age-related crackling in the bases of the lungs, which is not uncommon. Blood pressure is 138/82, a little elevated but not drastically so. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Any pain when I bend these?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s it. A little twinge, there. More of a stiffness, really. It’s worse in the mornings, or when it’s damp. And when I stand for too long. It’s just…old age, Doctor. What did I tell you? They used to ache, but the pain medication helps some, but I'm careful not to overdo it. I'm not one for running marathons. I mostly sit. It's much more comfortable, you see? And it doesn’t put any strain on my knees. I'm not a dancer, or a gymnast, or anything dramatic like that. I just like sitting and watching my stories.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Deloris. Your knees show some expected age-related wear and tear, and a little stiffness, which aligns with what you've described. There's no significant swelling or warmth. Based on everything you've told me, and what I've found in the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of loneliness and some mild depression, likely related to the divorce and social isolation. Your high blood pressure is controlled, and your knees are consistent with age-related changes. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Depression? That sounds… serious. I just thought I was a little sad sometimes. Is that what you’re saying, Doctor? I don't think I need treatment, or anything drastic like that. I just want to feel a little less…empty, I suppose. I don't want to be one of those people who sit around and mope all day. Do you think… a dog would help? My niece says they’re very good company. And I do enjoy watching them play on television. But I don't want to be responsible for a lot of…fuss, you see? I don’t want to be walking it in the rain, or cleaning up after it. Is there a… a quiet kind of dog?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel concerned about a diagnosis, Deloris. It's not about needing "treatment" in the sense of drastic measures. Often, it's about finding ways to cope and improve your overall well-being. What you're describing – feeling empty and lacking enjoyment – are common symptoms, and they're very treatable. And yes, a dog could absolutely help! Companion animals can be wonderful for combating loneliness and providing a sense of purpose. There are certainly breeds that are quieter and require less vigorous exercise. A smaller breed, or an older, more mellow dog, might be a good fit. Before we decide on that, I think it would be helpful to explore some other options as well. Would you be open to talking to a therapist, perhaps just for a few sessions, to learn some strategies for coping with loneliness and improving your mood?
PATIENT: Oh, a therapist? That sounds…a bit much, Doctor. I’m not one for talking about my feelings. I prefer to keep things to myself, mostly. I don’t want to sit around and analyze my childhood, or rehash old memories. I just want to feel a little bit better, that's all. I think a dog would be easier, honestly. Less talking. Less… introspection. I can talk to a dog. They don’t judge, you see? They just…listen. And they’re very good company. Do you think I could get a letter for a dog? A small one, maybe? A quiet one? That's all I want. A little bit of company. And perhaps a little bit of quiet. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Deloris. And I absolutely respect your decision about not wanting to pursue therapy at this time. It sounds like you've already given this a lot of thought, and you feel a companion animal would be the best fit for you. In that case, I am happy to write a letter stating that you would benefit from having a support animal, specifically a small, quiet dog, to help with loneliness and improve your overall well-being. I’ll need a little more information about the dog – if you’ve already selected one, or if you’re still looking. Do you have a preference for breed or size?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful, Doctor! Thank you. That’s all I needed. A letter. My niece has been looking online, actually. She says a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel would be a good fit. They’re small and quiet, she says. And very affectionate. She says they don't need a lot of exercise, which is good. I'm not very good at running, you see. And I don’t have a big garden. She's very organized. She's found a few breeders in the area, and she's going to arrange a visit. She says it’s important to meet the dog before committing to anything. She's very thorough. Just make sure the letter says something about… a quiet breed. That’s important. And maybe something about not needing a lot of exercise. I don’t want to be walking it in the rain. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Here you go, Deloris. This letter states that you would benefit from a support animal, specifically a small, quiet breed like a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, due to experiencing loneliness, and that the animal doesn’t require extensive exercise. It also includes a general statement supporting your need for a support animal to improve your overall well-being. Do you have any questions about the letter itself, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect, Doctor! Absolutely perfect. Thank you so much. You’ve been very helpful. And very understanding. I appreciate that. I think this is all I need. A letter and a quiet dog. A little bit of company. And a little bit of quiet. It's a good plan, isn't it? No, I don't think I have any more questions. Just… thank you again. You've made my day. I think I'll go home now and tell my niece. She'll be so happy. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. You’re a very kind man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Deloris. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you have a wonderful niece, and I hope you find the perfect companion. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything further down the line. Take care now, and enjoy your new friend. Goodbye, Deloris.
