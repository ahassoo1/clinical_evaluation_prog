DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, right. Sleep, mostly. And… feeling a bit rubbish, generally. Honestly, I don't really do details. It's just… not as good as it used to be, you know? I suppose fitness comes into it too, if sleep is part of that whole thing. It’s just… a general decline.
DOCTOR: A general decline… Right. Well, “general” isn’t terribly helpful for a doctor, I’m afraid. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When did you first start noticing this… decline?
PATIENT: Ugh, see? Details. It’s… a while. Honestly, probably after… well, after she passed. Everything sort of blurred together after that. I wouldn't even hazard a guess at a timeframe. Months, I suppose. Maybe a year? It’s all a bit… fuzzy, you know? Look, I fix violins for a living. Not remember dates.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Grief can certainly disrupt things. But a year is a long time to be feeling generally unwell. Let's focus on the rubbish feeling, as you put it. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: It's… tiring. Just… constantly tired. Even when I've had a decent sleep, which isn’t often, mind you. And a bit… sluggish. Like wading through treacle. Not actively sick, just… not right. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I need a lie-down by three o'clock. And I’m not getting any younger, of course. Though, truthfully, I don’t feel old. Just… worn.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, sluggishness… a noticeable decline in your stamina. And you’re experiencing this despite getting some sleep, although not consistently. Are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. No aches or pains. Digestion's alright, I suppose. Nothing that leaps out, honestly. I mean, I wouldn’t be here if it was something obvious, would I? It’s just this… pervading feeling of being… off. Like a poorly tuned instrument, I guess. Ironic, isn't it? I spend all day fixing other people's instruments, and I can't seem to fix myself.
DOCTOR: You mentioned your work. Does it involve any unusual exposures?
PATIENT: Exposures? What do you mean? Wood dust, I suppose. And varnish. Sometimes glue. Is that what you're getting at? It’s hardly hazardous materials, doctor. It’s violins, not a chemical plant. Though, old violins can be… dusty. Really, really dusty. Especially if they haven’t been played in a while. I wear a mask when I'm doing major work, of course. But I've been doing this for years.
DOCTOR: Right. Wood dust and varnish. We’ll make a note of that. And you wear a mask. Now, let’s talk about your sleep a little more specifically. When you do sleep, is it restful?
PATIENT: Restful? No. Not really. I wake up a lot. Tossing and turning. Dreams… mostly just jumbled nonsense. Not nightmares, just… activity. Like my brain won’t switch off. And I get hot. Really hot, even with the window open. And then cold. It's… frustrating, frankly. I used to be a solid sleeper. Eight hours, no problem. Now it’s more like… six, if I’m lucky, and it’s broken up.
DOCTOR: Fragmented sleep, waking up hot and cold, and a sense of mental restlessness. Okay. And you said this started after… your loss. Have you sought any support for that?
PATIENT: Support? Not really. I… keep busy. It’s better to just… get on with it, you know? I’ve got the work. Keeps my mind occupied. I’m not one for… talking about feelings. Always struck me as a bit… unproductive. Besides, who wants to listen to an old man complain?
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'd like to check your heart rate and blood pressure, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your throat. Then we’ll see about some bloodwork, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Though, honestly, I doubt it’ll show anything. It's not a physical ailment, doctor. It's… everything else. But do what you need to do, I suppose. Just try not to take too long, alright? I have a repair waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit up and lean forward. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Throat looks normal. No redness or swelling. Thyroid feels normal. Your heart rate is a little fast as well. We will need to get some bloodwork done. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your Vitamin D levels. I would also like to screen for sleep apnea. Do you snore?
PATIENT: Snore? My wife used to complain. Said I sounded like a… well, never mind. Loud, apparently. She's gone now, though. Haven’t had anyone to complain about it since. Does that count? Look, I wouldn’t know if I snore or not. I’m asleep. All this poking and prodding… it’s not going to solve anything, is it? It’s… a state of mind.
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule things out, Mr. Redfern. Sleep apnea can contribute to fatigue and other symptoms. We’ll get the bloodwork done, and then we can discuss further options. I’ll write you a referral for a sleep study, just in case. Here’s the lab requisition and the referral. The lab is just down the hall. Once you've had the bloodwork done, and if you decide to proceed with the sleep study, schedule an appointment with Dr. Aris at the Sleep Clinic. In the meantime, I recommend you try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. And perhaps consider some relaxation techniques before bed. While I understand this might not be what you want to hear, addressing potential physical contributors is a good first step. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Not really. It all sounds… a bit much, frankly. A sleep study? Honestly, I just want to feel normal again. But fine. I'll get the bloodwork done. And I’ll look into this… Dr. Aris. But don’t expect miracles, alright? I doubt poking me with sensors is going to fix anything. Right. Well. I suppose I should go get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or develop any new ones, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here is a card with our contact information. We’ll review the results once they’re available. Thank you for your time, Mr. Redfern. .
PATIENT: Right. Thank you. .
