DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, it’s not that good. My back’s been acting up again. It’s just… well, I wanted to ask if you could write me one of those cards. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or… encouragement. Something like that. It’s for my daughter, she worries so much. She’d feel better if the doctor told her I was doing okay, even if I’m not exactly leaping over buildings. It’s mostly for her peace of mind, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Janeth. It's very thoughtful of you to think of your daughter like that. A little reassurance can go a long way. And absolutely, I can certainly write a note for her. But before I do, I’d like to get a better understanding of what’s been going on with your back. It helps me write a more accurate and helpful note, and also ensures we're not missing anything important. So, when did your back pain start, and can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, really. It's been… oh, goodness, probably since I was about forty. But it flares up. Like now. It’s just… a dull ache, mostly. Right across my lower back. Feels like I’ve been carrying a sack of potatoes all day. Not sharp, just… there. And it gets worse if I bend over, or if I try to lift anything. Though, honestly, I try not to lift anything these days. It’s just… getting old, I suppose. You wouldn't understand, being a young man. But you doctors always want to know when things started. It’s just… a long time ago. And it’s always been this dull ache, really. Nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Janeth. It's helpful to know it’s been a long-term issue, and that it’s a dull ache rather than something sudden and sharp. Knowing the history is important. You mentioned it flares up. Can you tell me what usually triggers a flare-up?
PATIENT: Well… mostly just… using it, I suppose. If I spend too long in the garden, weeding. Or if I try to help my husband with something heavy around the house – which I don’t do anymore, mind you, but he still asks! It’s just… everyday things. Bending, twisting, reaching… anything, really. Honestly, sometimes I think it flares up just because it feels like it should. It’s probably just my age, like I said. And the weather, maybe? Damp weather always makes it worse. You can’t trust the weather these days. It’s just… unpredictable. Does it matter why it flares up? I just want the card, really. For my daughter.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Janeth, because understanding the triggers can help us figure out how to manage it better, even if it's just small adjustments to your routine. It also helps me rule out anything more serious. You're right, sometimes it is just age or the weather, but we want to be sure. You mentioned it gets worse with bending, twisting, and reaching. Does it radiate anywhere – like down your legs, or into your hips?
PATIENT: Oh, no, it doesn’t go down my legs, thank goodness. That would be terrible. It stays right in my lower back, mostly. Sometimes, if it’s a really bad flare-up, I feel it a little bit in my hips, but not often. Mostly just… a dull ache, like a weight. I do try to be careful, you know? I don’t want to make it worse. My husband, he's always telling me to slow down, to get someone else to do the heavy lifting. But I like to keep busy. Can’t just sit around all day, can you? It’s just… not me. Honestly, I think I’ve just got a bad back. It runs in the family, you know. My mother had a terrible back. And her mother before her. It's just… genetics, I suppose. Can we get to the card now? My daughter’s a worrier. She's probably already called three times today.
DOCTOR: We absolutely can get to the card, Janeth. And I understand your daughter is on your mind. But before I write it, I just want to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. It will only take a few minutes, and it will help me write a more accurate note for her, and make sure we aren't missing anything. I’ll check your range of motion, and do a little bit of palpation – just feeling around your back to see if there’s any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, I just want a card. I’m not here for a whole examination. It’s just my back. It’s been aching for years, like I’ve told you. What good will poking and prodding do? I’m an old woman, you know. Things are going to ache. And I don’t want you to find something terrible just because I asked for a little encouragement for my daughter. Honestly, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. Can't you just write a note saying I'm doing okay? For her peace of mind? I don't need a diagnosis, I just need a card. It’s really quite simple.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Janeth, and I apologize if I made it sound like a thorough examination was necessary. You're right, it may be nothing. But even a quick check can help me write a more reassuring and accurate note for your daughter. It allows me to say with more confidence that I’ve assessed things and everything appears stable. It’s simply a way to provide her with the best possible reassurance. I promise it will be brief and gentle. Just a few simple movements and feeling around, that’s all. If you’re uncomfortable at any point, we’ll stop immediately. And if we do find something, it doesn't necessarily mean it's terrible. It could just be something we can manage with simple strategies. Would you be willing to let me do a very quick check, for your daughter’s peace of mind?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly… you're very persistent, aren't you? Fine. But quick is the key word, Doctor. And gentle. Very gentle. I don't want you digging around. Just… a quick look. And if it hurts, you stop immediately. I’m an old woman, and I have sensitive bones. And don't tell me you've found something terrible, even if you think you have. I don't need any bad news. Just… get it over with. And then you write the card. Please. For my daughter. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. Quick and gentle, I promise. And I will absolutely respect your wishes and stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. I will explain everything as I go. Alright, if you could just sit comfortably in the chair, that's perfect. First, I'm just going to have you gently bend forward and touch your toes – only as far as is comfortable. Don't push yourself. I’m just observing your range of motion. Okay, good. And now, can you gently lean back, arching your spine a little bit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's been a while since I did that. Not as easy as it used to be. And it pulls a little bit… right across my lower back. But it's not sharp pain, you understand. Just a pull. Like a rubber band stretching. And that’s… not much better. It feels a little stiff. Like I haven't moved in days. Honestly, Doctor, I told you. It's just an old back. What do you expect? I'm not a spring chicken anymore. Can we get to the poking and prodding now? I'd rather just get it over with. And please, be gentle. My skin is sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janeth. And I will absolutely be gentle. You're right, it does sound like stiffness and limited range of motion are the main issues. Alright, now I’m just going to gently feel along your lower back, checking for any tenderness. Just tell me if anything feels particularly sore. I’ll start on the right side… Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, there! Right… there. That’s… a little sore. Not excruciating, but… definitely tender. It feels… tight. Like a knot. Like someone’s been tying knots in my muscles. It’s been like that for a while, I think. I’ve just gotten used to it. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not surprised. It’s always been sore there. What does that mean? Is it something terrible? Please don't tell me I need surgery. I can’t stand the thought of surgery. Can we just write the card now? For my daughter? She's probably having a panic attack right now. I can just feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. It's not uncommon to have some tenderness and tightness in the lower back muscles, especially with a long-term issue like yours. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything terrible, Janeth. It could simply be a muscle spasm or strain. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it doesn't seem like there's anything here that would require surgery. It's more likely a chronic muscle issue. I don’t believe we need to pursue any imaging or further testing at this time. Now, let's write that note for your daughter. What would you like me to say?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! You mean… it’s not serious? Just… old muscles? That’s good. That’s very good. Tell her… tell her I’m doing okay. That I saw the doctor and he said my back is… stable. And that I’m taking it easy. And that I’m not in any pain. Well, maybe a little bit, but nothing to worry about. And tell her I love her very much and that she needs to stop worrying so much. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Too good, maybe. She worries too much. And tell her I’m getting plenty of rest. Yes, that’s important. Tell her I’m getting plenty of rest. And… and that I’m looking forward to seeing her soon. Yes, that’s perfect. Just tell her all that. Please. For her peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. I’ll write a note that says exactly that. “To [Daughter's Name], Your mother came in for a check-up today and is doing okay. She is stable and taking it easy. She says she’s getting plenty of rest and is looking forward to seeing you soon. She wants you to know she loves you very much and to please stop worrying so much! Sincerely, Dr. Asami.” Is that alright?
PATIENT: Perfect. Absolutely perfect. She’ll be so relieved. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And very patient with an old woman. I should probably be going now. I’m sure my daughter is already calling. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve given me peace of mind. And you’ve given my daughter peace of mind. That’s the most important thing. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. It was my pleasure. And you take care of yourself, alright?
