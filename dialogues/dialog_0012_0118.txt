DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. Yoshino, you say? A… rather unusual name. As for why I’m here, well, it’s about this certification. One must keep up appearances, you understand. It’s a… requirement for continuing one's practice. Though frankly, I can't recall exactly what needs certifying at the moment. Something to do with… the ears, I believe? Or perhaps the eyes. It's all rather muddled.
DOCTOR: It is a bit unusual, yes – it’s Tlingit, from my mother’s side. And no worries at all about the details being muddled, that happens! It sounds like you're needing a medical examination for a professional certification. So, to clarify, you’re thinking it involves either your ears or your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Though I assure you, my memory is usually quite… sound. It’s simply that these administrative matters are so terribly dull. One forgets these things. It’s likely the eyes, yes. Though I do occasionally find myself asking people to repeat themselves. Not a serious matter, mind you. Just… the natural slowing down of things with age. A regrettable but unavoidable process.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s very common to experience changes with age, and it’s good you’re being proactive about it. Just to be thorough, even though you suspect it's your eyes, let's do a quick check of both your vision and your hearing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have… commitments, you understand. Important ones. Really, Doctor, couldn’t we simply focus on the eyes? It seems a rather wasteful expenditure of time to test something I’m reasonably certain is perfectly functional. But, if it must be… proceed, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course. It will be quick, I promise. Just a standard assessment to make sure everything is as it should be for your certification. We'll start with your vision, then quickly check your hearing. First, can you read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: “F… P… T… ah, yes. L… and… is that an R? Perhaps. These letters are rather small, aren’t they? And the lighting in here isn’t ideal. Really, one would think a professional establishment would pay more attention to such details.”
DOCTOR: Thank you. And you're right to point that out, I'll make a note to have maintenance adjust the lighting. Let’s try a different line, a bit larger. And don’t worry about guessing; just tell me what you see, even if it’s blurry.
PATIENT: “B… clearly a B. And… D? Is that a D, or a P? They rather look alike, don't they? And… V. Yes, definitely a V. Although… the angle is slightly off. It makes it difficult to be certain. Really, one expects a certain standard of clarity, Doctor. This is hardly a rigorous examination, is it?”
DOCTOR: You're right to be discerning, and I appreciate you pointing out these details. Different people see things differently, and these charts aren't perfect. Let's try this one. Same thing, just read the letters as best you can. Take your time. And if you’re having trouble distinguishing any letters, just tell me.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite unnecessary. I can assure you my vision is… adequate. Sufficient, even. I’ve been practicing for decades, you know. I would hardly be able to perform my duties if I couldn’t see properly. This entire exercise seems rather… patronizing, if I may be frank. I fail to see the point. Are we finished now? I have… arrangements.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels unnecessary. However, based on what I've observed so far - the difficulty reading the charts, the hesitation, and the uncertainty - your vision does appear to be somewhat reduced. It’s not necessarily a dramatic reduction, but enough that it might impact your professional certification requirements. To be thorough, and to ensure you meet those requirements, I'd like to do a more detailed visual field test and a quick check of your eye pressure. It's a very simple procedure. Would you be willing to let me proceed?
PATIENT: Reduced? Reduced? Are you suggesting I’m… impaired? After all these years of dedicated service? I assure you, Doctor, my diagnostic abilities are perfectly sound. And I find your implication… frankly, insulting. A visual field test? Eye pressure? This is preposterous. I will not be subjected to further… indignities. I believe I’ve wasted enough of my valuable time here. I shall take my leave. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, please. I wasn't suggesting your diagnostic abilities are impaired, only that a slight change in vision could impact your certification. It's a common occurrence with age, and easily corrected with glasses if needed. My concern is solely to ensure you meet the requirements, and I want to help you do that. However, if you are unwilling to proceed with the tests, I respect your decision. I strongly recommend you consult with an ophthalmologist for a full eye exam. I can provide a referral if you’d like. In the meantime, I will document my findings – the difficulty reading the charts, your expressed concerns, and your decision to seek a second opinion. Do you want me to write down a referral for you?
