DOCTOR: Good morning, Lytisha. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, was it? Yes, lovely to meet you as well. Um... well, it's about a test, I think. Something to do with... checking things? My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. They told me I needed to come in for a substance use screening... or a drug test. Something like that. It was the insurance, I believe. Medicare... they wanted me to get it done.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare sometimes requests these screenings. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the details; that’s what I'm here for. So, just to clarify, you were contacted about a substance use screening as a requirement from Medicare?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. A screening... because of Medicare. I get so many forms and letters, it all blends together, you know? I think someone called... a nice young lady. She said it was routine, and I needed to come in. I don't recall why exactly, just that it was important to keep everything up to date with the insurance. Is that... helpful? I hope I'm not being too vague.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Lytisha. You’re perfectly clear, and it’s very common to get overwhelmed with paperwork. It sounds like this is a standard screening requested by Medicare, possibly as part of a wellness check or to ensure continued coverage. Just to be thorough, and again, don’t worry if you don’t remember specifics… have you experienced any recent changes in your health, or have you been taking any new medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… well, I’m always a bit achy, you know, getting older. Nothing new new, I don’t think. And medications… let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter stuff, mostly. Nothing the doctor hasn't prescribed before, I don't believe. It's hard to keep track. I think that's it. Honestly, my daughter usually handles refilling everything. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. So, a medication for blood pressure, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And your daughter assists with managing your medications, which is wonderful. Now, before we proceed with the screening, could you tell me a bit about your general health history?
PATIENT: Oh, my health history... that's a long story, Doctor. I've lived a good long life, so there's been a bit of everything, I suppose. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. And I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit a long time ago – maybe twenty years now? My husband… he passed away a few years back, and that was hard on my heart, you know. Other than that... nothing major, I don't think. I get a little tired easily, but that's just getting old, right? I've always been fairly… sturdy, all my life. Worked hard, always. Is that… what you were wanting to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lytisha, that’s very helpful. A broken wrist, a history of smoking that you’ve thankfully stopped, and the loss of your husband – I’m very sorry to hear that. It’s perfectly understandable that would be hard on your heart. And yes, fatigue can certainly be a part of getting older, but it's good to rule out other causes. Before we get to the screening itself, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not to penicillin, I don't believe. I’ve taken that before, and I was fine. I think I had a bit of a rash once, years ago, from… poison ivy, maybe? Nothing serious. And I’m not really one for fancy foods, you know? So I haven’t had much chance to be allergic to anything unusual. Is that… enough? It’s just, I don’t spend much time worrying about allergies. Mostly just try to avoid the weeds in the garden!
DOCTOR: No penicillin allergy, and a mild reaction to poison ivy in the past. That's good to know. Alright, Lytisha, it sounds like we have a good basic overview. Now, this screening, as I understand it, is a urine test. It’s fairly straightforward. It’s just to check for the presence of certain substances. It’s routine, and the results are confidential, of course. Are you comfortable proceeding with that?
PATIENT: A urine test… yes, that sounds alright. As long as it’s not too… complicated. I can manage a urine test. Confidential, you say? That’s good. I just don't want everyone knowing my business, you know? Is there… anywhere private to do it? And how long will it take? I have a little appointment later this afternoon. I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Everything is completely confidential, Lytisha. We have a private restroom just down the hall specifically for these types of tests. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes – just enough time to provide the sample. I’ll give you a collection cup and instructions. Once you've provided the sample, you can leave it with the nurse, and she'll send it to the lab. Do you have any questions about the process itself?
PATIENT: A collection cup… yes, that sounds simple enough. Will it… hurt? I know, that sounds silly. It’s just… I’m not good with medical things, you know? I always worry. And what if… what if something shows up that shouldn’t? I haven’t done anything wrong, Doctor. I just want to make sure Medicare is happy, that’s all. Is that… clear? I’m probably asking too much.
DOCTOR: No, Lytisha, you’re not asking too much at all. It’s perfectly normal to be a little anxious about these things, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. No, it won’t hurt at all. It’s just a standard urine sample – completely non-invasive. And if anything unexpected did show up, we would discuss it privately, and I would help you understand what it means. We're just fulfilling a requirement from Medicare, as you said. It doesn't automatically mean anything is wrong. Would you like me to show you the restroom and explain the procedure in more detail before you proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that does sound… reassuring. Showing me the restroom would be lovely, Doctor. I always feel better when I know what to expect. And explaining it again… yes, please. I just want to get this over with, you know? It's just… a lot to think about for an old lady. Thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lytisha. That’s what I’m here for. Let’s go this way. The restroom is just down the hall, and it’s clearly marked. Here we are. You’ll find a collection cup inside, along with simple instructions. Just provide a sample as you normally would. There’s a lid to screw on tightly. Once you’re finished, just bring the cup to the nurse’s station, and she’ll take care of the rest. And you can refer to these instructions as well. Do you have any questions before you go in?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… very clear. A lid. Good. And the nurse’s station… yes, I remember seeing that. I think… I think I’m alright. Just a bit nervous, I suppose. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I'll go do it now.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Lytisha. I'll be here if you need anything.
