DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Stilaire. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It’s… well, it’s this fever. Keeps coming back. Been a nuisance, really. Don’t know what’s causing it, and frankly, I don’t have time to mess around with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. A recurring fever is certainly concerning, and I understand your desire to get to the bottom of it quickly. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this fever?
PATIENT: Okay, look. It usually starts with just feeling…off. Chills, you know? Then the temperature goes up. Not crazy high, usually around 101, 102 maybe. It lasts a couple of days, then goes away. But then, a week or so later, it’s back again. Happened maybe four times now in the last two months. And it always seems to happen when I'm busy. I'm a chiropractor, gotta keep moving.
DOCTOR: I see. A cyclical fever occurring four times in the last two months, accompanied by chills, and peaking around 101-102°F. It’s good you’ve been paying attention to the pattern, and that you note it coincides with periods of activity. To get a clearer picture, could you describe any other symptoms you experience along with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I get tired, of course. Really tired. Not just a little sleepy, but like my bones ache tired. Sometimes a headache, a dull one. And… I think my appetite goes down when it hits, but honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that. I eat when I can. No cough, no… nothing else really stands out. I haven’t noticed any rashes or anything like that. It’s just… feeling sick, and then not. And repeat.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. Bone aches, a dull headache, and decreased appetite accompanying the fever. No cough or rash, which is helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. A few back problems, being a chiropractor and all, but that’s it. I’ve never been one for going to the doctor unless I have to. My wife, Maria, she’s the one who usually worries about that stuff. I just try to keep moving, you know? She'd be the one to tell you if I had anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Clide. It's good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And it's reassuring to know you've been active. Let's move on to past surgeries. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Not a one. Always avoided them if I could. I figured I’d heal myself first. And usually, I did. Maria always said I was stubborn, but it worked. Still walking, still working. No surgeries, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had high blood pressure towards the end. And my father, he had some problems with his joints when he got older, arthritis I think it was. Nothing major, though. Maria's side... her grandmother had diabetes, I think. But other than that, not really. We weren't really the type to talk much about illnesses. More about… life, you know? Family gatherings, not doctor’s visits.
DOCTOR: I understand, Clide. It’s common for families to focus more on life events than medical history. Knowing about your mother’s high blood pressure, your father’s arthritis, and your grandmother's diabetes is still helpful information. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm. I work, a lot. Like I said, I’m a chiropractor. Long hours, on my feet all day. I try to eat fairly healthy, mostly Puerto Rican food, but Maria does most of the cooking. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. And I don't smoke. Never did. We live in the city, so not a lot of outdoor stuff, but I walk a lot getting to and from work. Pretty simple life, really. A busy one, though. Always something going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. That gives me a good sense of your daily life. And it’s good to know you don’t smoke and only drink occasionally. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything Maria puts in front of me. And I've never had a reaction to any medication. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches, but nothing serious. No sneezing, no itching, no rashes. Just… nothing. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Always been able to eat whatever, go wherever without worrying about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Clide. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my back's acting up, like I said. Maybe once or twice a month. Nothing regularly. Maria tries to get me to take vitamins, but I always forget. She leaves them on the counter, and they just… sit there. I’m not a big fan of taking pills unless I absolutely have to. So, no, not really taking anything right now. Just ibuprofen when needed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Clide. No regular medications, only ibuprofen as needed. Now, I’m going to take a look at your records here. It appears you haven’t had a physical exam in quite some time. To get a better understanding of what might be causing your recurring fever, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want this fever gone. Been messing with my work schedule. Do what you gotta do. I got things to do, you know? Just try to be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your temperature is slightly elevated at 101.5°F. Your heart and lungs sound normal, and your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any enlarged organs or areas of pain when I press on your abdomen. Your lymph nodes also feel normal. Based on this initial examination, there aren’t any immediate red flags, but the recurring fever warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I don’t even know what half of those words mean. CBC, BMP… Sounds complicated. Are those gonna take long? And… are they expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know? Just tell me what you need to do to get this fever figured out, and let’s get it over with. I'm not good with all the medical talk. Keep it simple, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I apologize for the medical jargon. Let me explain it simply. A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that checks for different types of cells in your blood. It can help us identify if you have an infection or any other blood disorders. A BMP, or Basic Metabolic Panel, is another blood test that checks your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and blood sugar. It helps us see if everything is working properly in your body. The tests will help me narrow down the possible causes of your fever. They usually don't take long – just a quick blood draw. And I understand your concern about the cost. I will check with the lab to see if we can offer any assistance or payment options since you don't have insurance. I'll also keep the testing focused to minimize the expense. Would you like me to proceed with those blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes. Just… do them. Let's get this done. But promise me you'll keep it as cheap as possible. I got bills to pay, you know? And tell me when I can expect results. I can't be running back and forth to the doctor all day. I got a business to run.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I absolutely understand, and I promise to keep the costs as low as possible. I'll write the orders for the CBC and BMP now, and the lab will draw the blood. It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the results to come back. I will have the lab fax them to me directly, and I will call you as soon as I have them. Here are the lab orders. You can take these to the lab, and they will draw the blood samples. Do you know where the nearest lab is?
PATIENT: Yeah, there's one on Elm Street, couple of blocks from here. I think it's called… City Labs, maybe? I've never been inside, but I know where it is. So, 24-48 hours, you said? I'll try to get there tomorrow morning. Just… please call me as soon as you know something. Don't make me wait longer than I have to. I got appointments to keep, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. City Labs on Elm Street is perfect. And I assure you, I will call you as soon as I have the results. I understand your time is valuable, and I won’t keep you waiting longer than necessary. In the meantime, if your fever spikes significantly higher – above 103°F – or you develop any new symptoms like severe headache, stiff neck, difficulty breathing, or rash, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's my number, just in case. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's it. Just... get those results back quick. And keep the bill down, alright? I appreciate you trying to help, Doctor. I really do. Gotta get back to work now. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. I will do my best. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
