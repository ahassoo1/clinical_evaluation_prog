DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kreckel. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, my left leg is quite swollen. It's been getting bigger these past few days, and it’s a bit worrying. I also… I have a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it beating too fast sometimes. They call it… atrial… fibrillation, I think? That's what they said last time I was checked.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes. We'll certainly need to keep that in mind. And this leg swelling… how quickly did it develop, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I suppose it started maybe… three days ago? It wasn’t much at first, just a little puffiness. But each day it’s gotten noticeably worse. I didn’t bump it or anything, so I was a bit concerned. It’s mostly in my calf, I think.
DOCTOR: Three days… and primarily in the calf. Has there been any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. More… a dull ache, if I push on it hard. It's not sharp or anything. Mostly it just feels heavy, you know? Like it’s weighing me down. It’s uncomfortable more than anything.
DOCTOR: Dull ache with pressure, feeling of heaviness… Any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t think so. It looks… normal, colour-wise. And it doesn’t feel particularly warm, no. Maybe a little warmer than my other leg, but not much. It's hard to tell, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has this been accompanied by any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No shortness of breath, and my chest feels fine. I haven't been dizzy either. I have been a little tired, but I usually am, to be honest. It's hard to say if that's different from normal.
DOCTOR: We'll need to do a physical examination of the leg, and I’d like to check your heart as well. Let’s start with the leg. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to palpate the calf to assess the swelling and check for any tenderness. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you need. Just let me know if you need me to move a certain way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you can just relax, I'm going to gently feel along your calf, starting here. Tell me if anything feels particularly sore. I'm noting some definite edema – swelling – in the lower calf. It’s pitting edema, meaning when I press, the indentation remains for a moment. Now, I’m checking your pulses… dorsalis pedis pulse feels weak, and the posterior tibial pulse is also diminished on that leg compared to the right. That’s not ideal. Heart rate is irregularly irregular, consistent with the atrial fibrillation you mentioned. I'm hearing some normal heart sounds, no murmurs at this time. Lungs are clear to auscultation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Weak pulses… what does that mean, exactly? Is it something serious? I understand the heart thing, but the leg… is it connected to that? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kreckel, it's certainly something we need to investigate further. Weak pulses can indicate a number of things, and yes, it could be related to your atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of blood clots forming in the heart, and those clots can travel to the legs, causing deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in a deep vein. That's what could be causing the swelling and diminished pulses. However, it's not the only possibility. We need to rule out other causes as well. I'm going to order a D-dimer blood test and a venous duplex ultrasound of your left leg. The D-dimer will help us assess if there's evidence of a recent blood clot, and the ultrasound will visualize the veins in your leg to see if we can identify a clot directly. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible and avoiding prolonged standing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A blood test and a scan… to check for clots. And put my leg up. That sounds… sensible. Is it very serious if it is a clot? And what happens if it is? Will I need… injections, or something? I'm not very good with needles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: If it is a deep vein thrombosis, it's a serious condition. Untreated, a clot can travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism, which is life-threatening. Fortunately, it’s treatable. Treatment typically involves anticoagulants – blood thinners – to prevent the clot from growing and to reduce the risk of further clots. These can be administered as injections, yes, though oral medications are also an option. If injections are necessary, we will, of course, ensure you are as comfortable as possible. We can discuss alternative methods if you have a strong aversion to them. But it's important to understand that prompt treatment is crucial. I'll have the lab technician draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. So… if it's in my lungs, that's very bad? And the injections… how long would I need them for? I just… I worry a lot, Doctor. It's the heart thing, you see. It makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kreckel, you do seem prone to unnecessary anxiety. A pulmonary embolism is a serious condition, yes, but we are taking steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. It's important to remain calm and let us handle the medical aspects. As for the injections, the duration of treatment depends on the severity of the clot and your individual risk factors. It could be weeks, months, or even longer. We’ll discuss a personalized treatment plan once we have the results of the tests. Now, let’s focus on getting those tests ordered. I'll also have the nurse take your blood pressure and temperature. Do you currently take any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications at all. Not even painkillers. I just… try to rest when I feel unwell. It's just… it's a lot to take in. And the thought of needles… but I understand you need to do what's best for me. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I've already placed the order for the ultrasound. I expect the results within 24-48 hours, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they are available to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, elevate your leg, stay hydrated, and try to minimize any unnecessary stress. I believe that will be all for today. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening leg swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. I'll try to stay calm and put my leg up. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will escort you to the lab. .
