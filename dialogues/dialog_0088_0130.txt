DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well… my family. Lots of… trouble with hearts, you see. My mother, my brother… both had problems. I just want to make sure I am okay. I don't want any surprises, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Schwer. It's very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history like that. So, to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about the heart problems your mother and brother experienced?
PATIENT: My mother… she had trouble breathing, mostly. Always tired. Then one day… just stopped. They said it was her heart. My brother… he had chest pain. Lots of it. He had… a thing. A blockage, I think? They put a… a tube in him, but it didn't help much. He was gone pretty quick after that. It was… sad. I don't know much about what it was, exactly. Just… heart trouble.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds very difficult, Mr. Schwer, and I'm sorry for your losses. Knowing that history is helpful. Now, let’s focus on you. Have you been experiencing any symptoms at all – any chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, or anything else that’s concerning you?
PATIENT: No… not really. Nothing like them. I get… a little tired sometimes, but I'm 73! I figure that's just getting old. Maybe a little… feeling in my chest, sometimes. Like… a flutter. But it goes away quick. Nothing to worry about, I think. I just… want to be sure. That’s all. I don’t want to end up like them, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. A little tiredness is common at your age, and a brief fluttering sensation can happen to anyone. But it’s good you’re paying attention to it and wanting to get it checked out. Just to be thorough, can you describe that “flutter” a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to explain. It’s not pain. It’s just… like a little fish flapping around in my chest. Not all the time, you understand. Just sometimes when I… when I walk up hills, maybe. Or after I eat a big meal. It doesn’t last long. A few seconds. Then it’s gone. It doesn’t bother me much, but… I worry about it. My daughter, she says I worry too much. But she doesn't understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s always best to investigate these things, especially with your family history. I'd like to do a quick EKG – that’s a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It will give us a good baseline to start with. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An… EKG? What does that… do, exactly? Is it… painful? I don't like needles. My brother… he didn't like needles either. And what if it shows something bad? I just want to know if I’m okay, not… not cause trouble.
DOCTOR: No needles at all, Mr. Schwer. It's completely painless. We just attach a few small stickers – electrodes – to your chest, arms, and legs. They read the electrical signals your heart is producing. It takes just a few minutes and doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. It's a very common test. As for what it shows, it simply gives us information. If everything looks normal, that’s great news. If there’s something we need to look into further, we'll discuss the options calmly and make a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… no needles, you say? Just… stickers? That sounds… alright, I guess. But what if… what if it does show something? Will I have to… have surgery? My brother… the surgery didn't help him. I don't want surgery. Just want to know if I'm okay. Can we just… see what it says first? Before we talk about surgery?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. We will absolutely see what it says first. We are nowhere near talking about surgery. The EKG is just a starting point – a piece of information. If anything is flagged, we will talk through all your options before making any decisions. I promise. We'll start with the EKG, and then we’ll go from there. Do you have any other questions about the test itself before we begin?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… quick, you say? And no needles? And you won’t talk about surgery unless… unless we have to? My daughter says I ask too many questions. But she doesn’t understand. I just… don't want any surprises. Okay. Let’s… let’s get it over with. Where do I… lie down?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Mr. Schwer. We'll take it one step at a time. Yes, it’s very quick. And absolutely no needles. You can lie down on the table over there, and I'll come over and attach the electrodes. It might be a little cool to the touch, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Let me know if anything feels wrong, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. A little cool, you say? I hope it doesn’t make me shiver. My old bones get cold easy. Just… tell me what you’re doing, okay? I like to know what’s happening. Don't want any surprises. .
