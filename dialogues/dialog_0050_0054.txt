DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tati. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Pleasure to meet you too. Cough… yeah, I got bad cough. Long time already. And… feel tired all the time. And my nose… always blocked, or runny. Gets sick a lot, like… sinus, I think they call it. It’s… annoying. I dunno what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, a persistent cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion – sounds quite bothersome, indeed. “Long time already,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah… maybe… six months? Or maybe longer. I forget easily. It comes and goes, but… always comes back. Especially when it rains, or when it’s cold. It’s… hard to explain. I just feel sick a lot, you know? Makes work hard. I fix tires… it needs strength.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer… I understand. Seasonal fluctuations can certainly exacerbate these types of symptoms. And your occupation requires physical exertion, which would naturally be impacted. To get a clearer picture, let's delve a little deeper. When you say “cough,” is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes dry, sometimes… yeah, brings stuff up. Like… phlegm. White, sometimes a little yellow. Not much, but it’s there. Sorry, I don’t know… medical words. Just… cough. Makes chest hurt sometimes when I cough real hard. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's quite common to produce phlegm with a cough. The color change can sometimes be indicative, but isn’t always conclusive. Chest discomfort with coughing isn’t unusual, either, but we need to ascertain its severity. Now, regarding your fatigue, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. But… mostly there. Even after sleep, still tired. I try to rest, but… don’t help much. Makes me… grumpy. My wife complains. I dunno what to do, Doctor. It’s just… always feeling weak. Work is hard enough already. I gotta provide.
DOCTOR: I see. Chronic fatigue can be quite debilitating. We will attempt to ascertain the cause. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high fever. Just… feel warm. Chills… yeah, sometimes when I’m really cold, I shiver. Night sweats… uh… I dunno. I sleep with the fan on, so… always a little sweaty. Is that… night sweats? Sorry, I don’t really pay attention.
DOCTOR: A low-grade fever and chills are noted. Regarding the sweating, it's difficult to differentiate normal perspiration from night sweats without a more distinct pattern. Let’s move on to your sinuses. You mentioned nasal congestion and a runny nose. Is there any pain or pressure in your face, particularly around your forehead, cheeks, or eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Around my nose and forehead, mostly. Like… blocked, you know? Hurts a little when I bend over. And… I smell things funny sometimes. Not bad smell, just… different. Like food, maybe? My wife says I smell things that aren't there. I dunno.
DOCTOR: Altered sense of smell...interesting. Facial pain and pressure consistent with sinus involvement. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Uh… appetite… not so good. I eat less, I think. Everything tastes… bland. Weight… I dunno. I haven't… weighed myself. My wife… she says I look thinner. But she always says that. I don’t know if I’m losing weight, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It appears we're accumulating a constellation of symptoms. Now, let’s briefly address your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as asthma, allergies, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Never been to the doctor much. Just… small things. Cough, cold, fever. Nothing serious. My mother… she had… I dunno, something with her lungs, maybe? But I don't remember exactly. My wife says I should see the doctor more. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. Just… little cuts and bruises from work. Fixing tires… sometimes hard on the hands. Never needed to go to the hospital. My wife… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… just… paracetamol sometimes. For the fever. And… cough syrup. But it doesn't really help much. Just makes me… sleepy. Nothing else. My wife… she gives me vitamins sometimes. But I forget to take them.
DOCTOR: Paracetamol and occasional cough syrup. Understandable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I don’t think so. Never had… reaction to anything. But I haven’t tried many things. Just… normal food. My wife… she cooks everything. I dunno. Never had a bad reaction to anything she cooks.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Tati, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination to assess your condition. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your lungs, check your sinuses, and take your temperature. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Lie down? Okay. I… hope it’s quick. I got tires to fix later. I don't like lying down, makes me feel dizzy. But… okay. Do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in...and out… again… and out. . Your lung sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some scattered rhonchi. . Tenderness present over the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Temperature is 37.8 degrees Celsius – a low-grade fever. . No significant lymphadenopathy noted. Heart sounds regular. . Alright, Mr. Tati. We have some findings here that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Uh… what does that… mean? Investigation? What kind of investigation? Am I… sick? Seriously sick? I got work… and my wife… she’ll worry… What do I need to do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Seriously sick" is rather dramatic, Mr. Tati. The findings—diminished lung sounds, sinus tenderness, and a low-grade fever—suggest a possible respiratory infection, potentially bronchitis or sinusitis. However, given the chronicity of your symptoms, and the fatigue you describe, we need to rule out other possibilities. To do so, I recommend a complete blood count to assess for infection, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs more thoroughly. I will also order a sinus CT scan to evaluate the extent of the sinus inflammation. We need to understand the precise cause of your symptoms before formulating a definitive treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… blood test? And… X-ray? And… scan? Lots of tests. What for? Is it… expensive? I don't have much money, Doctor. I just fix tires. My wife… she works too, but… it's not easy. What if it's something bad? What if I need to… stay in the hospital? I don't like hospitals, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, while I understand your apprehension, these tests are necessary to determine the appropriate course of action. The blood test will identify if there's an active infection and the CT scan and X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and sinuses for any abnormalities. Regarding cost, I am unaware of your financial situation and cannot provide an exact figure. However, the clinic does offer a payment plan option, and we can explore potential resources for financial assistance. At this stage, it’s premature to speculate about hospitalization. We will proceed systematically, review the test results, and discuss treatment options accordingly. I will have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the imaging studies. Please refrain from excessive worry—we will address this one step at a time. Do you have any further questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Nurse? Blood now? Okay… I guess. Payment plan… that’s good. I hope it’s not too expensive. I… really need to get back to work. But… okay. One step at a time… you said. Is the blood test… painful? And… the scan… is it safe? My wife… she worries about radiation.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will cause only momentary discomfort – a brief pinch. The nurse is very proficient. As for the CT scan, it does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of obtaining a clear diagnosis far outweigh the minimal risk. The radiation dose is very low and is within safe limits. We adhere to strict safety protocols. I assure you, the imaging studies are necessary to provide you with the best possible care. I will now have the nurse come in to draw your blood. Please let me know if you feel unwell during or after the procedure. Is there anything else I can address at this time before she arrives?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Just… don’t take too long. And… tell the nurse to be gentle. I… I get faint sometimes. Especially with needles. And… make sure it’s safe. My wife… she’ll be so worried if something happens to me. Okay. I think… that’s all. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have noted your concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly. I will review the results as soon as they are available and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Please try to remain calm. We will manage this efficiently.
PATIENT: .
