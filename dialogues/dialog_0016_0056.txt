DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer! Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest where to begin. It’s… work. This modern age and its… expectations. It’s simply dreadful. I believe my secretary scheduled this appointment due to… some… feeling I was experiencing. A rather unpleasant one, if I recall correctly. Can we please expedite this? I have a rather important cataloguing project awaiting my attention.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We'll get through this as efficiently as possible. When you say “feeling,” can you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s nothing concrete, Doctor. Just… a general… weariness. A lack of enthusiasm, shall we say? The students these days have no respect for the Dewey Decimal System, absolutely none. And the administration… well, let’s just say they prioritize “innovation” over order. It's… disruptive. A constant state of agitation, really. Is this truly necessary? I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling quite stressed and perhaps a little overwhelmed by changes at work. That agitation you describe – where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Feel it? Where don’t I feel it, Doctor? It's a… pervasive sensation. A tightness in the chest, perhaps. And a constant… throbbing. Though, truthfully, I’ve always had a rather sensitive constitution. My late wife used to say I worried too much. A woman of sound judgement, she was. And frankly, Doctor, I'm not accustomed to discussing personal ailments with strangers. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we simply… cataloguing my complaints?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Schlatterer, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable discussing everything in detail. The tightness in your chest is important information, though. Is it a constant pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’m… dealing with the… digital library system. A monstrosity, truly. They insist on everything being online now. It’s… chaotic. And the students! They rely on these… search engines instead of actually learning the proper methods of research. It's… demoralizing. It flares up mostly in the afternoons, I suppose. After dealing with… them. Is this all relevant, Doctor? I have a collection of first editions awaiting my classification. A rather important task, you see.
DOCTOR: It is all relevant, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like the stress from work is contributing to this chest tightness. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me if this tightness radiates anywhere – like to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiates? Doctor, I am not a weather system! It… occasionally feels a bit… uncomfortable in my shoulder. The left one, if I recall correctly. Though, I do spend a considerable amount of time hunched over antique books. Perhaps it’s simply… posture. A common affliction amongst academics, you see. Really, I fail to see the need for such detailed questioning. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of self-diagnosis. A lifetime of learning, you know. Are we nearing a conclusion? I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. Just to be thorough, and to rule things out, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perhaps take your blood pressure. It's a quick check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Must we? Really, Doctor, I am a man of letters, not a… specimen. Very well. But please, be quick about it. I have a rather delicate first edition of Pushkin awaiting my attention. And do try not to be too… intrusive. It's all rather… undignified. One expects a certain level of decorum, you see. Pushkin, 1837. A truly magnificent piece. Let us simply get this over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just take a deep breath for me… Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Your heart sounds regular, but I did hear a slight wheeze in your lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. It's not alarmingly high, but worth noting, especially given the stress you’re under. Now, have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, coughing, or fever recently?
PATIENT: A slight wheeze, you say? Perhaps it’s the dust. Antique books are rather… dusty, you know. And elevated blood pressure? I frequently indulge in a small glass of sherry with my evening meal. A civilized habit, if I may say so. Coughing… occasionally. A dry little tickle, nothing of consequence. Shortness of breath? No. Though, I do find myself slightly winded when carrying particularly heavy tomes. The Pushkin edition, for example, is quite substantial. Fever? Absolutely not. I maintain a rather rigorous routine. Early to bed, early to rise... and a strict avoidance of drafts. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect this is simply… the burden of knowledge. A heavy weight to bear, if you’ll excuse the pun. Are we finished now? I really must return to my cataloguing. The Dewey Decimal System won’t organize itself, you know. .
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're very dedicated to your work, Mr. Schlatterer. Given your age and the slight wheeze in your lungs, I'd like to rule out anything more serious. I recommend a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and a simple blood test to check your overall health. It's just a precaution. Also, while a small glass of sherry is unlikely to be the primary cause of elevated blood pressure, it's worth keeping an eye on. I would also advise trying some stress-reduction techniques - perhaps light exercise or some quiet time each day. Does that sound reasonable?
