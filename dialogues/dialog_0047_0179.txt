DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Press. It is… a pleasure to meet you. Well, it is… difficult to explain, really. Words… they do not come so easy now. I forget them. It is very frustrating, you understand? I… I have trouble finding the right words when I want to speak.
DOCTOR: Right. Trouble finding words. How long has this been going on, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Hmm… how long? That is… a good question. It feels like… some months now, perhaps? It started slowly, I think. At first, just now and then. But it is… more often now. I do not remember exactly when, though. It is… difficult to pinpoint.
DOCTOR: “Some months.” Alright. And is this difficulty with words constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes… yes, I believe that is correct. Some days are… better than others. Not good, mind you, but… less difficult. Other days… …other days it is a struggle to say even the simplest things. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes, I can imagine. Now, are you experiencing any difficulty understanding what people say to you, or is it purely with finding the words yourself?
PATIENT: That is… a very good question, Doctor. No, I… I understand what people say to me. I hear everything, perfectly. It is… speaking that is the problem. Not listening. It’s… finding the right words to reply, or to… to say what I am thinking. That is the difficulty.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s expressive aphasia, potentially. Have you had any recent head injuries, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Express… what? I… I do not understand that word, Doctor. And… head injuries? No, no, I have not… not that I recall. I… I was always very careful. I haven’t had any falls or bumps to the head recently. Perhaps a small bump as a child, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “expressive aphasia” simply means difficulty with speech. Let’s move on. Are you experiencing any weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness…? No, no, I do not think so. Everything feels… normal. Perhaps a little stiff sometimes, but not weak. I… I can walk perfectly well. I can lift things. I am… reasonably strong for my age, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my… vision? Hmm… That is… a difficult question. I wear glasses, you see. I have done for many years. My vision is not… perfect, of course. But I do not think it has gotten worse recently. No, not that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, with all due respect, it's difficult to get a clear picture of what's going on when details are… vague. It sounds like this has been a gradual onset. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I apologize, Doctor. I am trying my best. It is just… difficult to remember everything. Medications…? Yes, I take something for my blood pressure. And… something for my arthritis, in my hands. Small white pills, I believe. I… I do not recall the names, unfortunately. My daughter used to manage them for me, but… she is no longer here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication and something for arthritis. Do you know the dosages of either of those, or perhaps the names of the medications?
PATIENT: No, I am sorry. I truly do not. It has been… some time since I handled these things myself. My daughter… she kept track of everything. She was very organized. Now… I just take the pills she left me, as directed. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see if we have any records from previous visits. Ah, here we are. Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure… and Naproxen 500mg twice daily for arthritis. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your coordination?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that is correct! Lisinopril… and Naproxen. Thank you for finding that, Doctor. Headaches…? No, not really. Not recently. Perhaps a little tension sometimes, but not a proper headache. Dizziness… …no, I do not think so. And my coordination… …feels fine. I am not clumsy, if that is what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your mood, such as feeling unusually sad, anxious, or depressed?
PATIENT: Mood…? Well, Doctor, my wife… she passed away two years ago. It has been… difficult. Very difficult. I miss her terribly. I… I feel sad, of course. Very sad. And sometimes… anxious. Especially when I am alone. But I… I try to be strong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gyamfi. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways. Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and given the gradual onset of your symptoms, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause without further investigation. There are several possibilities. It could be related to a side effect of your medications, though it’s less common. It could be a transient ischemic attack, or TIA, which requires urgent attention. Or, given your age and the nature of your symptoms, it could be early signs of dementia. I’m going to order a full blood work-up, including a thyroid panel, and a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. We also need to assess your cognitive function with a series of tests. Are you willing to undergo these tests?
PATIENT: CT scan…? Tests…? Dementia…? Oh, Doctor… that sounds… very serious. I… I do not want anything serious. I just want to be able to… to find my words again. Are you saying… I am losing my mind? I… I am willing to do whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. But… please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, please try not to panic. I am not saying you are losing your mind. These tests are simply to help us understand what’s going on and rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. We need to gather information to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a plan to address your concerns. I’m going to schedule you for a CT scan as soon as possible, and I'll have the nurse schedule you for a cognitive assessment with our neuropsychologist. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving or making any important decisions until we have a better understanding of your condition. I'm also going to prescribe you a referral to a speech therapist for evaluation and possible treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A… speech therapist…? No… I… I don’t think so. Not right now. Will… will the tests be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I… I just want to know what is happening to me. And… will I be able to… to remember things again?
DOCTOR: The CT scan is non-invasive, Mr. Gyamfi. It involves lying still in a scanner while images are taken. It’s painless, although some people find it slightly claustrophobic. The cognitive assessment will involve a series of questions and exercises to evaluate your memory, attention, and language skills. It will take a few hours to complete. The results will typically be available within a week. I understand your anxiety, and I will do my best to expedite the process. It is impossible to predict the outcome at this stage, but we will develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs once we have a diagnosis. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule your appointments and provide you with written instructions. Do you have anyone who can accompany you to these appointments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I do not. My daughter… she is gone. I am… alone. I will… I will try to manage. Thank you for… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will ensure you have transportation assistance if needed. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi.
