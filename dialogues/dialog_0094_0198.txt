DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m interested in learning more about mindfulness, or maybe meditation. I keep hearing good things, and honestly, life feels a little… much sometimes. I thought maybe you could point me in the right direction, or tell me if it’s something that could even help me, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful question, Ms. Sugino, and a very proactive step to consider. Mindfulness and meditation can be incredibly helpful for managing stress and improving overall well-being. It’s excellent that you’re exploring these options. Before we discuss specific resources, could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "life feels a little… much?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, my job is… demanding. I repair signals and track switches for the railway. It’s important work, of course, but it's also a lot of responsibility. Always making sure everything is just right, you know? And it’s not always easy being a woman in a traditionally male field… there’s a lot of… pressure. And then, outside of work, I don’t really have a lot of close family nearby, so it can feel a bit isolating sometimes. It all just builds up, I guess. I don't sleep as well as I used to, and I find myself worrying a lot. It’s probably nothing major, but… it’s there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Sugino. That does sound like a lot to handle – a demanding job with high responsibility, navigating a traditionally male field, and feeling isolated. It’s completely understandable why you’re feeling stressed and having trouble sleeping. It's definitely not "nothing major" to be experiencing these feelings. Let's talk a bit more about how these feelings are affecting you day-to-day. You mentioned trouble sleeping and worrying – can you tell me more about the worrying specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly work-related, I think. I replay situations in my head, thinking about what I could have done differently. “Should have checked this, should have said that…” It's silly, really, because I always double-check everything, and I’m good at my job. But I still obsess over it. And then, sometimes it spills over into other things, like worrying about whether I locked the door properly, or if I remembered to pay a bill. It's just… constant, a little hum of anxiety in the background. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it makes me feel… on edge, I suppose. And tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Ms. Sugino – constantly replaying scenarios and feeling that underlying anxiety. It’s not silly at all; that’s a very common experience with stress and responsibility, and it sounds like it’s significantly impacting your quality of life. It's good that it's not preventing you from functioning, but the "tired" part is concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, let's do a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um, let me think… Not really. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing major. I see my general practitioner for yearly check-ups, and my blood pressure is usually a little high, but nothing they’ve medicated me for yet. Just told me to watch my salt intake. I have Medicare, so they keep a good record of everything. I had a bout of the flu two winters ago, but that’s about it. Oh! And I broke my wrist a few years back, falling on the ice, but it healed completely. I don't take any regular medications, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. I'll take a look at your chart through Medicare to confirm everything. Okay, I see the usual preventative care, a slightly elevated blood pressure reading as you mentioned, the flu, and the healed wrist fracture. No listed allergies, which is good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, anxiety, depression, or any other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother, she always worried a lot. Not like me, exactly, but she was a worrier. She didn't have any official diagnosis, but my aunt always said she was prone to anxiety. My father… he was a very stoic man. Didn't really talk about feelings much. He had high blood pressure, and eventually, he had a heart attack. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… well, they called it “nerves” back then, but I think it might have been depression. She spent a lot of time in bed. So, yeah, there's a bit of that on both sides, I suppose. It's not like a clear-cut, "everyone in the family has…" but it's there. It's more like a tendency, maybe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sugino. Knowing about the family history of anxiety and potential depression is very helpful. It does sound like there's a tendency in your family, which can increase your own risk. To get a clearer picture, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, if that. And definitely no recreational drugs. I keep pretty active, actually. I walk a lot, especially during my lunch break. It helps clear my head. I also enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. I find it very… grounding. I try to eat healthy, but I do have a sweet tooth. I can’t resist a good piece of baklava. My neighbor makes it, and it's… irresistible.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Sugino. Staying active and enjoying gardening are excellent coping mechanisms, and it sounds like you have a healthy lifestyle overall. And a little baklava now and then – that's perfectly reasonable! Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you’re feeling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Thyroid feels normal to palpation. Reflexes are normal and muscle strength is good. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems physically normal at this point, Ms. Sugino. This doesn’t rule out stress and anxiety, but it helps us to eliminate other potential causes. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you are experiencing significant stress and anxiety, likely related to your demanding job and navigating a traditionally male field, compounded by feelings of isolation. Your family history also suggests a predisposition to anxiety. Does that sound like a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds exactly right, Doctor. Perfectly right. It’s… relieving, actually, to hear someone say it. It’s easy to just brush it off, to tell yourself it’s just a demanding job, but… hearing you say it, it feels more… real. And validates it, I suppose. So, what happens now? What can I do about it?
DOCTOR: I’m glad it feels validating, Ms. Sugino. You’re right to seek help, and acknowledging it is the first and most important step. There are several things we can explore. Given your interest in mindfulness and meditation, that's a great place to start. I can recommend some resources – there are excellent apps like Headspace and Calm, and I have some pamphlets on mindfulness techniques. Beyond that, we can also discuss Cognitive Behavioral Therapy . CBT is a type of therapy that helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. It's very effective for anxiety and stress. We could start with a few sessions to see if it’s a good fit. In some cases, medication can be helpful, but I prefer to try non-pharmacological approaches first, especially given your overall health. Would you be interested in exploring CBT?
PATIENT: Hmm… CBT. I’ve heard of it, vaguely. It sounds… like a lot of work, honestly. Changing thought patterns… I don’t know. I’m not sure I’m very good at… looking inward, if that makes sense. The mindfulness, though… that sounds less intimidating. Maybe starting with that, and seeing how it goes? I’d definitely be interested in the apps and pamphlets you mentioned. And then, if that doesn’t seem to be enough, we can talk about the therapy again? That sounds… more manageable.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very sensible approach, Ms. Sugino. Starting with mindfulness is a great way to dip your toes in, and it's less demanding than therapy. We can always revisit CBT later if you feel it would be beneficial. I’m printing out a list of recommended mindfulness apps and some pamphlets on basic mindfulness techniques, including breathing exercises and guided meditation. I’m also going to give you a handout with some resources for local therapists if you decide to pursue CBT in the future. I recommend starting with just 5-10 minutes of mindfulness practice each day. Don't put too much pressure on yourself – the goal isn’t to eliminate all thoughts, but to simply observe them without judgment. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you're doing with the mindfulness practice. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. Five to ten minutes… I think I can manage that. And a month feels like a good amount of time to… try it out. Really, thank you. I already feel a little… lighter, just talking about it. I appreciate your patience and… understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad you’re feeling a little lighter. It takes courage to ask for help, and you’ve taken a very positive step. Remember, I'm here to support you. Let’s get you scheduled for that follow-up appointment. How about August 29th at 10:00 am?
PATIENT: August 29th at 10:00 am sounds wonderful. That works perfectly. Thank you again, Doctor. I think I'll be alright until then. I'm going to go home and… maybe try one of those breathing exercises. Have a good day! .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. You have a good day too, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
