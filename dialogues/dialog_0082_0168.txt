DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, honestly, I expected a… more modern facility. But, never mind that. I’m here because I’m… well, I’m starting to date someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things get… serious. You know, for both our sakes. It’s just… one must be careful.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Esthela. A good idea to get things checked out before things progress. Prudence is always a good thing. So, a general check-up… Are you having any specific symptoms or concerns at the moment, or are you just wanting a baseline assessment?
PATIENT: Baseline assessment, I suppose. Though, I have been feeling a bit… tired lately. Not debilitating, you understand, just… not quite as energetic as I used to be. And my digestion hasn't been quite right. It's difficult to explain. It’s… irregular. But I attribute that to stress, mostly. Starting to date again after… well, a long time, it's a bit disruptive, you see. Nothing a good night's sleep wouldn't fix, I'm sure. But it’s best to be thorough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, thoroughness is always best. Fatigue and digestive changes… Those can be related to stress, certainly, but we want to rule out other possibilities. Let’s start with a little more detail about this fatigue. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… perhaps three months now? Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, you see. Not a sudden collapse, just… less enthusiasm for things. I used to enjoy my gardening immensely, but lately, I find myself… postponing it. And then feeling guilty about postponing it. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I suppose it coincided with… meeting Charles. Though I insist it's not him, specifically. It’s just… a lot to consider, re-entering the dating world at my age. One wants to make a good impression, you know.
DOCTOR: Three months, gradual onset… coinciding with meeting Charles. And it's impacting your usual activities, like gardening. Alright. And you mentioned irregular digestion. Could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not consistent, you see. Sometimes I feel… rather bloated. Other times, everything is perfectly fine. And then… occasionally, there’s… a lack of regularity, if you understand my meaning. Nothing alarming, just… inconvenient. And it's… distressing to discuss, frankly. I’ve always been a very… private person. But I understand it’s necessary for a proper assessment. I’ve tried over-the-counter remedies, naturally. But they haven’t been particularly effective, and I prefer not to rely on those sorts of things long-term. They’re… artificial, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. It is often difficult to discuss these things. And you’re right to be cautious about long-term use of over-the-counter remedies. Bloating and irregularity… Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. No blood, no unusual colors. Perfectly normal in that regard. Though, it’s… softer than it used to be, perhaps. Not alarming, just… a change in consistency. And I do apologize for being so… detailed. It’s just… I like to be thorough, as I mentioned. One can’t expect an accurate diagnosis without providing all the pertinent information, you know? I wouldn’t want to waste your valuable time with vague descriptions.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all. Detailed information is exactly what I need. It helps me build a clearer picture. So, softer stools… Alright. Now, let’s move on to a more general review. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all – that you’ve noticed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been feeling a bit… warmer than usual, lately. Not a fever, you understand. Just… flushed, particularly in the evenings. And I’ve been sleeping… rather soundly, actually. Perhaps too soundly. It’s difficult to wake up in the mornings. And… oh! My hands have been a bit shaky, occasionally. Not constantly, just… a slight tremor. I attributed that to the stress, again. But it’s been happening more frequently. Is that… worrisome? I do hope not. I have a luncheon scheduled next week with Charles’s mother, and I’d rather not be… incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Flushing, sound sleep, and occasional hand tremors… These are all things we should investigate further. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had one in my life. I'm quite proud of that, actually. Though my late husband, bless his soul, was terribly allergic to shellfish. Had to be extremely careful when dining out. But I myself am perfectly fine. I eat just about everything. I believe a balanced diet is key, you see. And plenty of water. Although, I must admit, I've been neglecting my water intake lately. Stress, again. It distracts one from the essentials. But no allergies whatsoever. I’ve always been a very robust individual, health-wise. Until… recently, of course. But I’m confident this is just a temporary… blip. A minor inconvenience, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned being generally robust until recently. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my multivitamin, Doctor. A standard dose. And occasionally, I take an antacid if I have a bit of indigestion. But that's infrequent, as I mentioned. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. I believe strongly in the power of a healthy lifestyle. And I don’t believe in relying on pharmaceuticals unless absolutely necessary. My late husband was rather fond of them, and… well, let’s just say it didn’t end well. So, just the multivitamin and the occasional antacid. Nothing else. I pride myself on being self-sufficient. I don't want to become reliant on anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and occasional antacid. Now, let’s briefly touch on your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all my life. A few minor ailments, naturally – the occasional cold, a touch of the flu – but nothing serious. My late husband, bless his soul, had a bit of high blood pressure, but I never suffered from it. I’ve always been very careful about my diet and exercise. And I manage my stress levels, as much as possible. So, no chronic conditions whatsoever. I’m a rather… straightforward case, I believe. A healthy, robust individual who is experiencing a few minor inconveniences. But I’m confident we can resolve them quickly and efficiently. I have a luncheon with Charles’s mother next week, you see, and I’d rather not be… incapacitated. It's a very important occasion.
DOCTOR: Alright, no chronic conditions. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had the need. I’ve always been very careful, as I mentioned. Avoided any risky activities. I prefer a quiet, peaceful life. My late husband had his appendix removed, years ago, but I myself have never been under the knife. I’ve always believed in the power of preventative care. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress management. That’s my philosophy. I've been very fortunate, truly. A healthy, robust individual with no chronic conditions and no surgeries. But these recent… inconveniences are rather unsettling, to be honest. It's quite unlike me. I'm hoping it's just a temporary… blip. Perhaps a bit of stress, as I've been saying. But it’s best to be thorough, isn’t it? Especially with the luncheon approaching. Charles is a very nice man, and his mother seems… discerning.
DOCTOR: Yes, thoroughness is always best. Let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had a touch of arthritis in her later years. Nothing debilitating, just a bit of stiffness in her joints. And my father had high blood pressure, but he didn't take particularly good care of himself. A bit of a gourmand, you see. Loved his rich foods. My maternal grandmother had… well, I believe it was some sort of digestive ailment, but I don't recall the specifics. It was years ago, and I wasn't particularly interested in medical matters at the time. My late husband's mother had… well, she lived to be ninety-eight, so she must have been doing something right. No significant medical conditions that I'm aware of. A generally healthy family, all things considered. Though, my late husband’s uncle had a bit of a drinking problem, but that's hardly a medical condition, is it? So, no significant medical concerns that run in the family. A generally healthy lineage, all things considered. But these recent… inconveniences are rather unsettling, to be honest. It's quite unlike me. I'm hoping it's just a temporary… blip. Perhaps a bit of stress, as I've been saying. But it’s best to be thorough, isn’t it? Especially with the luncheon approaching.
DOCTOR: Alright, some arthritis, high blood pressure, and a digestive ailment in the family, but nothing major. And finally, a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner… occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I find that sort of thing… appalling. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, as I've mentioned. A balanced diet, regular exercise, and moderation in all things. I’ve always been very… proper, you see. My late husband… well, he enjoyed a bit of a tipple, but I always kept him in check. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and absolutely no recreational drugs. I pride myself on being a responsible and respectable individual. I’ve always been very… proper, you see. And I intend to remain that way. Especially with the luncheon approaching. It's a very important occasion, you understand. Charles is a very nice man, and his mother seems… discerning. I want to make a good impression, you see. A very good impression. And these recent… inconveniences are rather unsettling, to be honest. It's quite unlike me. I'm hoping it's just a temporary… blip. Perhaps a bit of stress, as I've been saying. But it’s best to be thorough, isn’t it? Especially with the luncheon approaching.
DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’ve lived a very healthy and conscientious life. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a brief abdominal exam. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A thorough examination is precisely what I want. Though, I must warn you, my blood pressure may be slightly elevated due to the… anticipation of the luncheon. And my abdomen… well, it's been a bit… unsettled, as I've mentioned. But I trust your expertise. Please, proceed. I'm confident we can resolve these minor inconveniences quickly and efficiently. I want to be at my best for Charles’s mother, you see. A very good impression is crucial. And these recent… inconveniences are rather unsettling, to be honest. It's quite unlike me. But I trust you, Doctor. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, a little fast but nothing concerning at this point. Lungs sound clear. 140 over 90. A bit elevated, as you suspected. Now, let’s just gently feel your abdomen. Hmm. It is a bit tender in the lower abdomen, on both sides. Not acutely painful, but certainly sensitive. And I feel a slight… fullness. No masses that I can detect, but some distention. Okay, Esthela. Everything seems within normal limits, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and the abdominal tenderness warrant a little further investigation. I think we should run some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. And I'd like to order a stool sample to rule out any infection. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood work and a stool sample… a thorough investigation is precisely what I want. Though, I must warn you, I’m not particularly fond of providing stool samples. It’s rather… undignified, you see. But I understand it’s necessary for a proper diagnosis. And I trust your expertise. I want to resolve these minor inconveniences quickly and efficiently. The luncheon is fast approaching, you see. A very good impression is crucial. And I’m rather anxious about… well, I don’t want to disappoint Charles’s mother. She seems like a very discerning woman. So, yes, please, proceed with the blood work and the stool sample. I’m confident we can get to the bottom of this. And I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a very competent physician. Now, where do I go to provide this… sample? I must admit, I’m rather flustered just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Esthela. It's not the most pleasant thing, but a necessary step. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. They'll give you a container and instructions. It’s a relatively simple process, and they are very discreet. The nurse, Sarah, will provide you with the blood work requisition. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, usually within a few days. In the meantime, let's discuss some things you can do at home. Continue to eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of water, and try to manage your stress levels. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've been very thorough and reassuring. A healthy diet, plenty of water, and stress management… I shall do my best. And I shall contact the office immediately if anything… untoward occurs. Though, I sincerely hope that won’t be necessary. The luncheon is fast approaching, you see. And I’m rather anxious about making a good impression on Charles’s mother. She seems like a very discerning woman. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease… somewhat. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall go and… procure this sample. It’s rather… undignified, you see. But I trust your expertise. And I trust you, Doctor. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results.
