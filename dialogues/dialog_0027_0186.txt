DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Lamark is fine. Yeah, well, I'm trying out for a team. Need to get a check-up, make sure I'm still good to go, you know? Don't want any surprises during practice.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. That’s good foresight, wanting to get checked out beforehand. Just to be clear, you’re trying out for a sports team, and you want a general check-up to ensure you're healthy enough to participate. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yep, that's it exactly. Don't want to pull a muscle or anything, get old before my time. What kinda things are you gonna check, anyway? Just so I know what's comin'.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. We'll do a fairly standard physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears, nose, and throat… things like that. I'll also want to ask you some questions about your medical history, any medications you're taking, and any allergies you have. And of course, we’ll talk about any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Alright. No medications, no allergies. Never really had much trouble with either, thankfully. Medical history… hmm. Nothing major, if that makes sense. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that healed up fine. Everything else, pretty standard stuff. I’m a pretty healthy guy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No current medications or allergies, broken arm as a child, otherwise healthy… That’s helpful. Just to clarify, when you say “standard stuff”, have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Just the usual colds, flu, you know. Nothing that kept me down for long. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Look, is this gonna take long? I got practice later, and the coach isn’t real patient with tardiness.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as quick as possible. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the physical exam. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I stay pretty consistent. Maybe a pound or two here or there, but nothing major. I weigh myself sometimes, but I don't obsess over it. I'm, uh, about 130-ish usually. Give or take. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It does, a little. We want to get a baseline. And it’s good you’re aware of changes. Okay. And are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Nope. No pain. Maybe a little stiffness in the mornings, getting old, you know? But nothing I can't work through. Just normal aches and pains. Nothing that stops me from doing things. Really. I'm pretty flexible for my age, if I do say so myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain, just some morning stiffness. Good to know. Do you have any trouble breathing, or any chest pain with exertion?
PATIENT: No, no trouble breathing. And no chest pain, not at all. I run a lot, you know? Gotta be able to breathe for that. I’d notice if I was having trouble, I think. Look, are we almost done with the questions? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Almost. Just a few more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urination recently?
PATIENT: Uh… no. Everything’s… regular. You know. Normal. Look, doc, with all due respect, are these questions actually relevant to a sports tryout? I’m a pretty healthy guy, I told you that. I just need a quick once-over to make sure I'm good to go. I don't want to waste your time or mine.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. It’s important to understand the reasoning. These questions help me get a complete picture of your overall health, even for a sports physical. It's about ruling out anything that could potentially cause a problem during activity. I apologize if they seem… thorough. Okay, last question, and then we’ll do the physical exam. Do you have a family history of any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Okay, fair enough. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. Other than that, not really. Pretty healthy family, overall. Look, can we please get to the exam now? I’m really starting to worry about being late.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. High blood pressure in your father, diabetes in your grandmother. Thank you. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. If you don’t mind, please sit up on the exam table. We'll start with your heart and lungs. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Let's check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Elevated? 140/90… Is that bad? My dad had high blood pressure, like I said. I haven't really been checked in a while.
DOCTOR: It’s a little higher than ideal, yes. And your family history is relevant. We’ll need to monitor that. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious right now, but it's something we should be aware of. Okay, let's check your reflexes quickly. Knees have 2+ reflexes bilaterally. That’s normal. Let me just quickly examine your throat and ears... Throat appears clear, no signs of infection. Ears are clear as well.
PATIENT: Okay. Monitor it… Right. So, what does this all mean? Am I good to try out, or what? I’m wasting daylight here. The coach is gonna kill me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. Based on the exam, you’re generally in good health, but your blood pressure is elevated. Given your family history, I recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss this further and potentially start monitoring it more closely. As for the tryout… it’s a bit of a judgment call. You can participate, but I would advise you to take it easy at first. Don't push yourself too hard, stay hydrated, and listen to your body. If you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or shortness of breath, stop immediately. I'm slightly concerned about the blood pressure, and I don't want to completely clear you without a more thorough evaluation. Would you be willing to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in a week to reassess?
PATIENT: A week? Look, doc, I appreciate the concern, but I can’t wait a week. The tryouts are tomorrow. I guess… I guess I’ll just take it easy. Listen to my body. I’ll try not to overdo it. Is there anything else, or can I go? I really gotta run.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. I understand. In that case, please be extra cautious during the tryout. If anything feels off, stop immediately. And it's very important you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician as soon as possible to discuss your blood pressure. Here's a handout with information about managing high blood pressure. I’ll write a note summarizing the exam findings, including the elevated blood pressure, for your physician. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Thanks… I guess. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Good luck at the tryout, Mr. Kingan. And please, take care of yourself. .
