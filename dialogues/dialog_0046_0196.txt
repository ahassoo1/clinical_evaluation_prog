DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s hard to say exactly. Just… tired. Really, really tired. Been that way for… a while now, I guess. It’s not like I don’t do things, just… everything feels like a huge effort. I mostly just want to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling constantly tired can be very disruptive, and it's good you're coming in to get it checked out. “A while now” is a bit vague – could you try to give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? Let me think… Maybe six months? Or was it eight? It's hard to pinpoint. After… after my husband passed, things were just… blurry. The tiredness felt like part of that, but it hasn’t really gone away, even though… well, you know. It just is.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband’s passing, Ms. Licano. It’s completely understandable that you’ve been going through a difficult time, and grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including fatigue. It's helpful that you're able to differentiate that the tiredness persists, though. To get a clearer picture of what might be going on, could you describe the tiredness a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s alright, thank you. It was… a long time ago now. As for the tiredness… It’s not just being sleepy, you know? Like, I can sleep eight hours and still feel like I haven't slept at all. It’s… heavy. Everything feels heavy. And… I have trouble focusing. Like, I’ll be doing something – making a sandwich, even – and just… lose track. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s not necessarily a desire to sleep more, but a lack of restorative sleep, and it’s accompanied by a feeling of heaviness and difficulty concentrating. That's helpful to know. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My joints ache sometimes. Not all the time, but enough to notice. And… I've been a bit more forgetful than usual, even for me. It’s not big things, just… where I put my keys, or what I was saying mid-sentence. Oh, and I've had a few headaches, but they’re not terrible. Just… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint aches, increased forgetfulness, and some mild headaches in addition to the fatigue, lack of restorative sleep, and difficulty concentrating. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been… under control for years now, I think. My doctor, before… he had me on pills for it. And… I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that wasn’t a big deal. Honestly, that’s all I can really remember off the top of my head. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but… well, things changed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, currently controlled, and a cholecystectomy in the past. That’s good to know. Do you recall what medication you were on for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name… it escapes me. It was a little white pill, I think. I really don't remember the name, I’m sorry. He just told me to take it every day, and I did. It's all a bit of a blur now, honestly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really paying close attention to the details, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. It’s common not to remember specific medication names from the past. We can look into your records to see if we can find that information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. My mother had… arthritis, I think? Bad joints, like me. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. He passed away when I was young. Nothing else really springs to mind. It wasn’t something we talked about much, to be honest. They weren't… the healthiest people, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A family history of arthritis and heart problems is helpful to know. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month, but that's it. No, nothing like that. I'm a fairly… quiet person, to be honest. I mostly just keep to myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and a relatively quiet lifestyle. Thank you for being so open with me, Ms. Licano. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, please. I just want to figure out what’s wrong and get back to… well, just get back to things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. I'll do my best to be quick and thorough. Okay, Ms. Licano. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds are a bit quiet, and your lungs are clear. Neurologically, everything seems intact. I also note some mild tenderness to palpation of your joints, particularly in your hands. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary findings of the exam, I suspect several things could be going on. It could be related to your previous hypertension, the effects of grief, or something else entirely, like early arthritis or a vitamin deficiency. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some lab work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lab work? Oh dear. More poking and prodding? I suppose so. If it will help, then yes. Just… try to make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Licano. We'll only take what's necessary, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, a Vitamin D level, and a C-reactive protein test to check for inflammation. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us rule out some potential causes for your fatigue and other symptoms. Do you have any allergies to any medications or latex that I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any problems with anything like that. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No known allergies. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Honestly, I just want to feel… normal again. Just… thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. That's a very reasonable desire, and we’ll do everything we can to help you get there. I want to assure you that we'll take a thorough approach to investigate this and find a solution that works for you. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, please feel free to relax and take a few deep breaths. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
