DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Quicksey, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it's my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. Lots of diarrhea. It's been going on for a while now, but it feels worse lately. I… honestly, I can't really remember when it started, exactly. It just feels like it’s always been a bit of a problem, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds frustrating when it's been going on for a while and it's hard to pinpoint when it began. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say “not good” and “worse lately,” could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It’s… watery, obviously. And… frequent. Like, a lot more often than normal. And it’s… sometimes it’s just a little bit, and sometimes it’s… a lot. Sorry, that’s probably too much information. And it's… not always just diarrhea, sometimes there's… discomfort, like cramping. It's hard to explain. I don’t usually pay that much attention to it, to be honest. Is there a way to… like, a scale or something?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jase. It's important to be thorough, and you’re providing helpful information. And yes, there is a scale! It's called the Bristol Stool Scale. It categorizes different stool types. Do you mind if I pull it up on the computer here so we can see if that helps you describe it more easily?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good, actually. If it makes it easier. I’m terrible at describing things like that. A scale sounds much better than me trying to explain it. I'm not very good with medical stuff, so please don’t mind if I ask you to explain things slowly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no problem at all. We'll take this at your pace. This is the Bristol Stool Scale. It goes from Type 1 – separate hard lumps, like pebbles – all the way to Type 7 – completely liquid. Could you tell me which type best describes what you've been experiencing, generally?
PATIENT: Okay, I see… Hmm. It’s definitely not the hard lump ones, that’s for sure. And it’s… not always completely liquid, like number 7. Most of the time it’s… somewhere in between, I think. Maybe… a 5 or a 6? It’s kind of soft and mushy, with… bits in it sometimes. I’m sorry, this is gross. It changes, too, depending on what I’ve eaten, I guess.
DOCTOR: It's not gross at all, Jase; this is important information, and I appreciate you being so open. A 5 or 6 is helpful. So, it fluctuates, more liquid with certain foods?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. Like, if I eat anything really… rich, or spicy, it’s worse. And dairy… dairy doesn’t always agree with me. I don’t remember exactly what sets it off, but I know if I eat something and I feel it coming on, I usually know what it was. I’ve always just tried to avoid things that bother me, but it’s getting harder and harder to remember what those things are, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be challenging to pinpoint trigger foods, especially when it's been a long-term issue. Besides the diarrhea and cramping, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get… tired a lot. I thought it was just because of work, but maybe it’s related? And sometimes my stomach just… hurts, even when I don't have diarrhea. Like a dull ache. And… I’ve lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser than usual. I don’t weigh myself regularly, though. I just thought I was eating less.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, a general stomach ache even without diarrhea, and some unintentional weight loss. That’s good information to have. Now, let's step back a bit. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t actually vomited. I get a little nauseous sometimes, especially before the diarrhea starts, but I never actually throw up. Just… feel queasy, you know? Like I might, but it doesn’t usually happen. It's mostly just the stomach upset and then… everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, just occasional nausea. Now, thinking about your past medical history – have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or anything else related to your digestive system?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Um… I think… a long time ago, a doctor said something about my intestines being… inflamed? It was years ago, I barely remember. I think they mentioned something about… Crohn’s disease? Or maybe Ulcerative Colitis? I had a lot of tests, but honestly, I was so stressed about everything, I didn't really pay attention. They put me on some medication, and it got better for a while, so I just… stopped going to the doctor. It wasn't as bad, so I figured it was fine. I really don't remember much about it. It was a really difficult time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, Jase. It sounds like you may have been evaluated for some form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in the past. Do you happen to know the name of the doctor you saw then, or where you were treated?
PATIENT: Ugh, that’s… hard. It was a really long time ago, and I've moved a few times since then. I think… Dr. Patel? Maybe? It was a hospital in Birmingham. I’m really sorry, I’m terrible with names and dates. It was… before I got married, definitely. It was a large hospital, but I can't remember the specific name. Everything feels so hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can try to track down records later if you’d like. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just the usual. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Oh, and I take something for my allergies, it’s a nasal spray. And I have some pain relievers for headaches, but I don’t use them very often. Nothing specifically for my stomach, though. I haven’t taken anything for it in a long time. I tried some over-the-counter stuff a while back, but it didn’t really help, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin, allergy nasal spray, and occasional pain relievers. And you’ve tried over-the-counter medications for the diarrhea without much success. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction to anything. I eat a lot of different foods, and I haven't had any problems. I’m pretty good with most things, actually. My husband is the one with all the allergies! He has to be careful about nuts and things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, particularly related to the digestive system, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has… something with her stomach sometimes. She gets really bloated and uncomfortable, and she's always complaining about indigestion. I don't know if it's serious or not. She's always saying it's just old age! And my grandmother, on my dad’s side, had colon cancer, I think. She passed away a long time ago. That's… about all I remember, to be honest. We don't talk about medical stuff much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother has digestive issues and your grandmother had colon cancer. Thank you for sharing that information. And finally, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I don't drink alcohol, either. Never really liked it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I work a lot, so I don’t really have time for anything like that. My husband might have a beer sometimes, but I stay away from it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Jase. That gives me a good overall picture. Given your history of potential inflammatory bowel disease, the fluctuating diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and family history of colon cancer, I want to do a physical exam and order some lab tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m just… tired of feeling sick, so I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure it out. I just hope it's not something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then, I'll do a quick rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it's important. After that, I'll order some blood tests to check for inflammation, anemia, and other things. We'll also need a stool sample to rule out any infections. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a little scary, but yes, okay. The rectal exam sounds… uncomfortable, but I understand it’s important. Blood tests and a stool sample are fine, too. I just… want to get this over with, if that makes sense. Just let me know if anything is going to hurt.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you’re experiencing any discomfort at any time. Alright, let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Could you lie back on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m ready. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. I’m hearing some normal bowel sounds, but I am noticing a little bit of tenderness in your lower left abdomen. Not severe, but present. Does that feel uncomfortable when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, like I usually feel. It feels… worse when you press on it, though. It's in that general area, yeah.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That confirms my initial assessment. Now, I’m going to perform a quick rectal exam. I will use a gloved and lubricated finger to gently check for any abnormalities. It may feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. I will keep it as quick and gentle as possible.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. I understand. Just… please be quick. And tell me what you’re doing as you go, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just inserting my finger now. Just relax your muscles as much as possible. I don't feel any masses, and the rectum feels relatively smooth. There is a little bit of tenderness, which is consistent with what you described. No signs of blood. I'm removing my finger now. That's all done. Did that cause you any significant discomfort?
PATIENT: It wasn't… as bad as I thought it would be, but it was still uncomfortable. A little bit of pressure, yeah. Not painful, just… strange. Glad it’s over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Thank you for your patience. Now, let's get those lab orders sorted out. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for anemia and inflammation. We'll also do a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, a Stool Culture and Ova and Parasite test to rule out any infections or parasites. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. So, I just need to… go to the lab? And then they'll call me with the results? Do I need to do anything special to collect the stool sample?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll just need to go to the lab. They'll take some blood. As for the stool sample, it’s best to collect it in a clean, dry container – you can pick one up at the lab. It's important to avoid contaminating the sample with urine or toilet water. They will give you specific instructions at the lab, but essentially you'll want to collect a small amount—about a walnut-sized portion—and bring it in as soon as possible. They’ll likely need a few samples collected over a couple of days. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: Okay, a walnut-sized portion in a clean container, avoid urine, and a few samples over a couple of days. I think I can manage that. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained it really well. Just… let me double-check with my husband to make sure he doesn't accidentally use the wrong container!
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea! It's easy to mix things up. Alright, I’ll have the lab orders sent over electronically. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back—usually within a few days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody stools, or significant changes in your condition, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a little less worried now, even though there's still a lot to figure out. I really appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. Remember, we’ll take this one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. Stop by the front desk, and they’ll assist you with any necessary paperwork.
PATIENT: Thank you, you too. .
