DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been happening for a couple of weeks now, and it’s really starting to get to me. It's...well, it’s just there, you know? Constant.
DOCTOR: Constant ringing, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, constant. Not super loud, thankfully, but it’s always…present. It makes it hard to concentrate, especially when it’s quiet. Like, I work as a waiter, and usually the restaurant noise covers it up, but when I get home…it’s noticeable.
DOCTOR: And how would you describe the ringing, Mr. Dhanoa?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It's not like a bell, or anything specific. More like…a high-pitched whine, I guess? Sometimes it feels like buzzing too. It changes a bit, but it’s always something. It's hard to explain, honestly. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term. We see quite a bit of tinnitus. Has anything specific happened recently that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Work's been the same, no big changes there. I went to a concert a month ago, maybe? It was pretty loud, but I’ve been to louder concerts before and never had this happen. Divorced a year ago, so things are pretty settled on that front. No injuries or anything like that either. I'm honestly stumped.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you notice any other symptoms accompanying the ringing?
PATIENT: Just…feeling a bit tired, maybe? It's hard to say if that’s from the ringing keeping me up, or just life, you know? No dizziness, no hearing loss that I’ve noticed, no pain or anything. Mostly just…annoyed. It’s a constant distraction.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, no hearing loss. Okay. Let's do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat. I'm going to take a look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we'll do a basic hearing test. This will just involve putting headphones on and indicating when you hear tones.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds simple enough. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Dhanoa. Open wide… good. Hmm. Your ear canals appear clear. No obvious signs of wax build-up or infection. Now, let’s proceed with the hearing test. I'm going to play some tones at different frequencies and volumes. Just press the button when you hear a sound, even if it's very faint. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense. Press the button when I hear something. Got it. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. The test is complete. It appears you have mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears. This correlates with your report of tinnitus. We often see this pattern. Now, I need to ask some more detailed questions about your medical history. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises regularly – machinery, firearms, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I used to work construction for a bit, maybe ten years ago, but it was a long time ago, and I always wore earplugs. Apart from that, nothing springs to mind. It's just…work, and then home. I guess concerts, but like I said, not consistently. Is it definitely that? I thought it was more…something inside my head.
DOCTOR: It's a possibility, Mr. Dhanoa. But the hearing test results strongly suggest noise-induced hearing loss, even if it was some time ago. Cumulative exposure, you see. Now, have you ever experienced any ringing or buzzing in your ears before this recent episode?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tough one. Now you mention it…maybe? A really faint ringing, after a particularly loud concert, but it always went away pretty quickly. Like, within a few hours. Nothing like this, though. This is constant, like I said. It’s just…it’s frustrating because I don’t know what caused it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of hearing loss or tinnitus?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. My mum's a bit hard of hearing now she’s older, but that’s just age, I think. My dad’s got perfect hearing, as far as I know. No one's ever mentioned anything about ringing in their ears before. Is this going to need further tests? I'd like to get this sorted if possible, I have work you know.
DOCTOR: Further testing could be done, an audiogram for a more detailed assessment, but frankly, given your history and the results we have, I suspect this is a classic case of noise-induced hearing loss with resultant tinnitus. We'll proceed cautiously. Now, about medications...are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take anything regularly. Just the occasional painkiller if I get a headache. Other than that, nothing. I try to stay healthy, you know? Is this something I need to worry about? Like, will it get worse? I have to hear at work!
DOCTOR: It can worsen, Mr. Dhanoa, if you continue to expose yourself to loud noises without protection. Now, I am going to recommend hearing protection - earplugs or earmuffs - whenever you are in a noisy environment. Furthermore, I will refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss tinnitus management strategies. There are coping mechanisms and therapies that can help you adjust to the constant ringing. It’s unlikely to resolve completely, but you can learn to manage it. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Alright, hearing protection… earplugs. Got it. No allergies. Not to anything that I know of, anyway. Look, Doctor, is this something that’s going to affect my job? I need my hearing for work, I take orders you know. I can’t be asking people to repeat themselves all the time. Honestly, I was hoping for a quick fix. Is there anything, anything at all, that I can take?
DOCTOR: There is no “quick fix” for noise-induced hearing loss, Mr. Dhanoa. Medications are not typically effective for tinnitus. I am recommending the audiologist, who will discuss options such as tinnitus retraining therapy and sound masking techniques. They can provide personalized strategies to help you cope with the ringing and minimize its impact on your daily life. Now, I will write you a referral. As for your job, protecting your remaining hearing is paramount. If you continue to expose yourself to loud noises without protection, the condition will worsen. Finally, are you currently experiencing any stress, anxiety, or depression?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Audiologist. Look, I'm divorced, okay? It’s been a year, and things are…settled, but it wasn’t easy. Work is busy, and I’m just…tired. Stressed, yeah. Who isn’t these days? But depression? No, not really. Just…annoyed, mainly. Annoyed with the ringing, annoyed with everything, really. Can I get the referral now? I want to get this over with, if that’s okay?
DOCTOR: Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, an excellent audiologist. She will assess your hearing and develop a management plan. I suggest you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. As for your stress, consider seeking counseling if it becomes overwhelming. However, that is outside the scope of this consultation. I have documented your report of recent divorce and general stress. Are there any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. I’m generally healthy, I eat okay, I try to exercise… just this ringing. Okay, well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll schedule the appointment with the audiologist. Hopefully they can help.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with the audiologist as directed. And remember, protect your hearing. Good day, Mr. Dhanoa.
