DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I'm not usually one for these sorts of…visits. My husband thought it would be a good idea, seeing as I’ve…started seeing someone new. He insists on being thorough. It’s all rather…unnecessary, if you ask me, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always good to be thorough, and it's thoughtful of your husband to encourage you to prioritize your health, even if it feels a bit…unconventional right now. To clarify, are you here today for a general check-up related to starting a new relationship, or are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, really. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. It’s simply…prudence. My husband is a very practical man. He wants to be certain I haven't…forgotten anything important, shall we say. He worries about these things. It’s more a matter of ensuring everything is…in order, before I commit to anything further. Though, I’m not precisely certain what needs ordering, if I’m honest. He just said “a check-up.”
DOCTOR: I see. So, a comprehensive check-up to ensure everything is functioning optimally, as a preventative measure. That's perfectly reasonable. We can certainly do that. To start, let's go over a bit of your medical history. Do you have a primary care physician currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dr. Abernathy, over at St. Luke’s. Though I haven’t seen him in…well, it’s been a few years, honestly. Routine things, you understand. Blood pressure, cholesterol…the usual. He always said I was remarkably healthy for my age, despite…certain indulgences. He retired last year, actually. A lovely man. I haven't found a replacement yet. Frankly, they don't make doctors like him anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to miss a good doctor. It sounds like Dr. Abernathy provided excellent care. Since it's been a few years since your last check-up, and you're establishing care with me, we'll want to get a comprehensive update. Let's start with some basics. Could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with, or any major illnesses or surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils out as a child, of course. And I broke my wrist once, trying to ride a horse. A rather foolish endeavor, in retrospect. Other than that…I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, but that cleared up quickly. Oh, and I was quite prone to migraines in my twenties, but those mostly subsided after menopause. I've always been quite…sturdy, health-wise. Not like some people, constantly ailing. I do take a daily vitamin, naturally. And a little something for my joints. It's just age, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, a broken wrist, bronchitis, and a history of migraines that have improved. You also mentioned taking a daily vitamin and something for your joints. Could you tell me the names of those medications, and the dosages you take?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dosages. Honestly, Doctor, I leave that to my husband. He manages all that. Let me see…the vitamin is just a standard multivitamin. One of those chewable ones, I think. As for the joints…it’s called Glucosamine Chondroitin, I believe. And he gets it…from Costco, probably. A large bottle. I take…two tablets a day, I think. Or maybe three. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur. He just tells me what to take, and I take it. It keeps me moving, at least. Though, I'm not convinced it does much else.
DOCTOR: That's helpful. We can certainly clarify the dosages with your husband. Now, are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I'm aware of. I eat everything. I’m rather adventurous, actually. Though I do avoid shellfish. Not because of an allergy, per se, but…the texture is simply appalling. And I find it rather unsanitary. My mother always said one should be careful with things one finds at the bottom of the sea. Sensible woman, my mother. I occasionally have a slight reaction to pollen in the spring, but that's just a bit of a sniffle. Nothing a tissue can't handle. Frankly, I find the whole concept of allergies rather…dramatic.
DOCTOR: I understand. No known drug, food, or significant environmental allergies. Just a preference to avoid shellfish and a bit of seasonal sniffles. That’s good to know. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…that’s a rather grim topic, truthfully. My mother's side…heart trouble, mostly. Several early deaths. She always warned us to watch our cholesterol. My father’s side…diabetes, I believe. And…a touch of dementia in my aunt. Not pleasant. My brother has high blood pressure, which he refuses to take seriously. Honestly, it's a rather alarming lineage. It's probably best not to dwell on it, if I’m honest. It doesn't exactly inspire confidence, does it? Though, I have always been remarkably healthy, despite it all. At least, I think so.
DOCTOR: I understand. History of heart trouble on your mother’s side, diabetes and dementia in your aunt, and high blood pressure in your brother. It's good to be aware of these risks. And it's excellent that you’ve remained healthy so far. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m retired, thankfully. I used to work as a…personal service manager, which was quite stressful, actually. Now I mostly spend my time gardening, reading, and…socializing. My husband and I enjoy going to the theater. And I’m quite active in my book club. I don’t exercise, per se. I find it rather undignified, frankly. Though gardening is quite strenuous, actually. And I do enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner. A good Chardonnay, preferably. And I confess, I enjoy a little chocolate now and then. One must have some indulgences, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A balanced life is important, and enjoying those indulgences is perfectly reasonable. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me if you’ve ever smoked, or used any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I find the very idea…repugnant. My parents instilled in me a very strong sense of propriety. And frankly, I’ve always considered such things…beneath me. I do occasionally have a glass of wine, as I mentioned, but that’s hardly the same thing. And I certainly haven’t engaged in any…illicit activities. I’ve always been a very…respectable woman. My husband would be appalled, if I’m honest. Appalled, I say.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or your concerns today?
PATIENT: Well…there is one thing. It’s rather…delicate, actually. And frankly, I’m a bit embarrassed to mention it. But my husband insisted. He says it’s important for…thoroughness. I’ve…started dating someone new. And he wants to be certain I haven’t…forgotten anything important in that regard. Things one might need to discuss with a physician. He's being rather…specific. It’s rather awkward, honestly. He's made it quite clear he wants me to be…safe. And protected. It’s all a bit much, if you ask me. But he’s a practical man. A very, very practical man. And he paid for this appointment. So…I suppose that’s what he wants to discuss. Discreetly, of course.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s perfectly reasonable for your husband to be concerned about your health and well-being, and it’s good that you’re both being proactive. We can certainly discuss any health concerns related to your new relationship, and I assure you, everything we discuss will be kept confidential. To start, have you had any changes in your menstrual cycle, or experienced any unusual vaginal discharge or discomfort?
PATIENT: Good heavens! Doctor, are you suggesting…? I haven't had a menstrual cycle in decades! I went through menopause years ago. It's…rather insulting to even ask, frankly. I'm a married woman. A retired married woman. I simply mentioned I was dating someone new. It doesn't mean…any of those things are relevant. I'm not suddenly reverting to adolescence, you know. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather…uncomfortable. Perhaps I should just leave. This is all a bit much. My husband is going to hear about this, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Oh, my goodness, I am so incredibly sorry. That was a completely inappropriate question, and I sincerely apologize for causing you any discomfort or offense. You are absolutely right to be upset. I was attempting to be thorough, but I clearly overstepped a boundary and failed to consider your medical history appropriately. Please accept my deepest apologies. We will absolutely move past that question and focus on your overall well-being, as you requested. Let’s take a step back. To make sure I'm understanding correctly, your husband is primarily concerned about ensuring you have all the necessary information to maintain your health and safety in this new relationship?
PATIENT: Yes. That is…precisely it. He's worried about…things. Things one might need to discuss with a physician before embarking on a new…adventure. He's very focused on…prevention. And protection. He's been reading articles online, I suspect. He’s rather…obsessive about these things. It's all very tiresome, frankly. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of looking after myself. I've lived a long and…responsible life. But he’s paid for this appointment, so I suppose I must humor him. He just wants…reassurance. And a list of…things, I suspect. Things I might need to mention to…the gentleman. It’s all rather undignified. But here we are. Perhaps you could simply tell me if I'm…deficient in anything? Or if there's anything I should be…aware of? Before I proceed. It's probably that, isn't it? A list of potential deficiencies.
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like a reasonable approach. We can certainly review potential vitamin or mineral deficiencies, and discuss any health considerations relevant to starting a new relationship. To start, do you have any current medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol, that are being actively managed?
PATIENT: No. Nothing actively managed, no. I had slightly elevated cholesterol a few years back, but I've been watching my diet. And it's come down considerably. I've always been quite…disciplined about these things. My husband monitors it regularly, of course. He's very insistent on regular check-ups. I do get a little…breathless sometimes, if I exert myself, but that’s just age, I suspect. And perhaps a little weight gain. I used to be much slimmer, you know. But frankly, I find it's better to be comfortable than…svelte. So, no. Nothing actively managed. Just…age. And a husband who worries. It's a package deal, really. Would you like me to list my medications again? I'm starting to feel rather repetitive.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. We don't need to repeat the medication list. And it's perfectly normal to experience some age-related changes. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. It’s just a quick check to get a baseline of your current health status. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be gentle. And quick, if you wouldn't mind. I'm not particularly fond of…being poked and prodded. I suppose it's necessary, if my husband is going to be satisfied. But I do have a luncheon engagement later. And I'm not fond of being late. So, yes. Proceed. But please, be quick. And gentle. I do have rather sensitive skin, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, but I do notice some mild wheezing on exhale. Do you experience any shortness of breath or coughing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Oh dear. That must be from…the pollen. It’s been a particularly bad season, you know. I mentioned the sniffles earlier. Yes, I do get a little…short of breath sometimes, if I exert myself. Walking up hills, for example. Or climbing stairs. But nothing alarming. I’ve always been…a little sensitive, you know. Delicate lungs, perhaps. My mother used to say I was prone to chest congestion as a child. It's probably just that. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, I do wish you wouldn't make such a fuss. It’s rather…stressful, all this poking and prodding. And the suspense. What will you discover next? It's all very…unsettling. And I really must be going soon. I’m sure my husband won’t be pleased if I'm late.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Pandolfi. It’s good that you're aware of your body, and it's not uncommon to experience some mild wheezing with seasonal allergies. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem. Now, I'd just like to briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back and let me know if you feel any tenderness. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s…a little tender, actually. Around here. It’s probably just…gas. I had a rather large salad for lunch. And I do tend to…retain water, you know. Especially this time of month, though, as I’ve said, that’s become…less of a concern lately. No, not really pain, just…discomfort. A little fullness. And a little…bloating. It’s not unusual, honestly. I’ve always been…prone to digestive issues, you know. Sensitive stomach. Delicate constitution. Honestly, I’m not sure what you’re hoping to discover. I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. Despite my husband’s anxieties. And my slightly elevated blood pressure. And the wheezing. And the bloating. It’s all perfectly normal. For me, at least. Can we be done now? Please? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Pandolfi. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, you have slightly elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, and some tenderness in your lower abdomen, which you attribute to gas and bloating. Given your history of digestive issues, I'm not overly concerned about the abdominal tenderness at this time, but it’s worth monitoring. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, I'd like to order some routine blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We can also check your vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, it never ends. Very well. If my husband insists, I suppose I have no choice. But please, make it quick. And painless, if possible. And can you please explain the results to me in plain English? I don't understand all that medical jargon. And can you also give me something for the wheezing? It's quite bothersome, you know. And perhaps something for the…bloating? It’s rather embarrassing. Yes. Blood work, wheezing medication, and bloating relief. And please, hurry. I really must be going. I have a luncheon date, you know. And I do not appreciate being kept waiting. This is all very…stressful. And frankly, rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I will order the blood work right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the samples quickly. I will also write you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler for the wheezing. It's a short-acting bronchodilator that will help open your airways when you feel short of breath. As for the bloating, let's start with some lifestyle recommendations. I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages, limiting processed foods, and drinking plenty of water. If those measures don’t provide relief, we can discuss over-the-counter options, like simethicone or activated charcoal. Here are the lab orders and the prescription for the inhaler. The nurse will give you instructions on how to use the inhaler before you leave. I will review the blood work results as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I don’t think so. Just…hurry, please. And make sure the nurse explains everything clearly. I don’t want any surprises. And tell her to be gentle. I have sensitive skin, you know. And please, make sure the prescription is filled quickly. I don’t want to be without it for long. Honestly, Doctor, this has been…quite an ordeal. I hope I don’t have to come back here anytime soon. It’s all very…stressful. And frankly, rather undignified. I do wish my husband would just let me enjoy my life. But he's…practical. And persistent. And pays the bills. So here we are. Thank you. I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. I have a luncheon date, you know. And I do not appreciate being kept waiting. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I understand. Please take care, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a pleasant luncheon. .
