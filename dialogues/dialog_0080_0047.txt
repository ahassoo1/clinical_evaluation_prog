DOCTOR: Hi Cleo, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Rosanova, right? Yeah. Well, it's about… insurance. Long-term care, I think. My daughter, she set this up. I… I don’t really remember all the details. She said it was important to get looked at. Something about needing to be… checked out for the future? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like your daughter is being very proactive, which is great. So, it's a bit of a check-up related to long-term care insurance?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. My daughter, Leona, she worries a lot. Good girl, though. Real good. I just… I mostly do work, you know? Moving things around, down at the docks. Keeps me busy. Don’t usually have time for doctors and… paperwork. So, what kind of check-up is it? Is it gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Right, moving things around at the docks – that sounds physically demanding. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. It’s a general health assessment, mostly to establish a baseline for future insurance coverage. They want to see your current health status. We’ll go over your medical history, do a quick physical exam, and maybe some blood work. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… let me think. My back… it gets sore sometimes, from lifting. Always has. Old injury, I think. When I was younger. And… I had something with my lungs, a long time ago. When I was a kid, I think? Pneumonia, maybe? It was cold, real cold. I was in bed for a long time. But… that was a long time ago. I don't really go to the doctor much. Not unless I have to. Does that… count?
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain from lifting, and a childhood illness – possibly pneumonia. That’s helpful. And you haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything else recently?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I… I don’t think so. I get tired, sometimes. Working hard all day, you know? And my hands ache. But I figured that was just… from the work. Old age, maybe. Leona says I should take better care of myself, but... it's hard to slow down when you gotta make a living.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s tough to prioritize self-care when you’re focused on work. Just to be thorough, when you say your hands ache, is it a constant ache, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly after a long day. You know, gripping ropes, loading boxes… It’s just… a dull ache. Doesn’t really stop me from working, though. I’ve always been able to push through it. Used to bother me more when I was younger, I think. Now it’s just… part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that childhood illness?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I don’t think so. Maybe when I was a baby? I don’t really remember. And… hospitalized? Not really. I broke my arm once, when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But I don’t think I went to the hospital for it. The local doctor set it, I think. Just a cast, for a few weeks. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, Leona, my daughter, she's my only family left. My wife, she… passed away a few years back. Real sad time. We were married a long time. My parents… they're gone now too. It's just me and Leona. She takes good care of me, though.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you and Leona have a strong bond. Do you know if any of your parents or wife had any significant medical conditions—things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything that ran in the family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… my mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think. Towards the end. Real tired, a lot of the time. And my father, he had… something with his lungs, maybe? He smoked a lot, when he was younger. Didn’t take care of himself. My wife… she was pretty healthy, as far as I know. She always ate good, and walked a lot. But… I don’t really remember anything specific. It was a long time ago, and… I don't really pay attention to those things, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother, and possible lung issues in your father due to smoking. That’s helpful. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. Always thought it was a bad habit. My father smoked, like I said, and he didn’t live a long life. So I stayed away from it. Leona always told me it was good to stay healthy too.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes. After work, you know? Just one or two. Nothing much. Leona doesn't like me to drink too much. Says it's not good for my health. I mostly drink water, to be honest. Working on the docks, you get thirsty.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one or two beers occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don't think so. I get a little itchy sometimes, if I get stung by a mosquito. But that's about it. Never had a real bad reaction to anything. Leona always asks me this too. She's always worried about something. I mostly just eat what she cooks. She makes good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a pain reliever sometimes, if my back is really bothering me. Just ibuprofen, I think. The regular stuff. And… Leona gives me some vitamins sometimes, but I forget to take them half the time. She tries to get me to be healthier.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, occasional ibuprofen for back pain and some vitamins you don’t always take. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. It won’t take long. Would you mind stepping up there for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Just tell me what to do. Always been a bit clumsy, to be honest. Hope I don’t fall.
DOCTOR: Don’t worry, I’ll be right here to help. Just take your time. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Okay, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Would you mind taking a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… Feels a bit funny, having someone listen to my chest. Never been a fan of doctors. But I'm trying, for Leona's sake. Is everything alright? It sounds… echoey in there.
DOCTOR: Everything sounds okay, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. It's subtle, but it could be a sign of some congestion, or even old lung issues. Nothing to panic about right now. Now, let's check your pulse. Your pulse is 78, regular. And finally, let's take a quick look at your throat. Say "ahhh" for me. Your throat looks clear. No signs of infection. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Thanks for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Glad everything looked alright. A bit worried about the crackling in my lungs, though. Is that bad? Like my father? Leona's gonna be worried too.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about the crackling. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the same thing your father had. The crackling could be from a number of things, including old lung issues, mild congestion, or even just your age. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It’ll give us a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out anything serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… sounds serious. But… if you think it's best, then alright. I trust your judgment, Doc. I just… don't want to worry Leona too much. She gets real stressed out easy. Where will we do the X-ray? And will it take long?
DOCTOR: It's a quick and painless procedure, Cleo. We can do it right here at the clinic. It will only take a few minutes. The technician will just ask you to stand or sit in front of the X-ray machine, and they'll take a couple of pictures. And don't worry, it’s a routine test. We're just being thorough. While we wait for the results, I'd like to order some blood work as well. That will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. Would you mind getting some blood drawn?
PATIENT: Blood work… ugh. Never been good with needles. But… alright. If it helps, then I'll do it. Just… let me know when it's gonna happen. Don't want to be surprised. And can I… sit down while we wait for the X-ray and blood work? My legs are getting a bit shaky.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please, sit down. We'll get you settled and then the technician will come in to explain everything. I'll be right here if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll also let you know when the blood work is ready. While we’re waiting, let's discuss some general health recommendations. Since you work at the docks, it's important to stay hydrated and take breaks throughout the day. Have you been using any protective gear – gloves, a mask – to protect yourself from dust or other irritants?
PATIENT: Hydrated… yeah, I try. Mostly just water, like I said. Breaks… sometimes. Depends on how busy it is. And… protective gear? We have gloves sometimes, for handling boxes. But not really a mask. It’s dusty down there, but… you get used to it, I guess. Never thought about it too much. Leona told me I should wear a mask, but… it makes it hard to breathe when you're working hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's tough to balance safety with being able to do your job efficiently. But breathing in dust regularly can irritate your lungs over time, especially given the mild crackling we heard earlier. It might be worth looking into a lighter-weight, more breathable mask, just to minimize the risk. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: Diet… Leona mostly handles that. She cooks good, healthy food. Lots of fish, vegetables. I try to eat what she makes, even if I don't always feel like it. She says it's good for my heart. I'm not much of a cook myself. Always too tired after work. She worries about me, that one. A lot.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear you have a supportive partner looking out for you. A healthy diet is definitely important, especially with your family history. Technician: "Dr. Rosanova, are you ready for the chest X-ray and blood work?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I guess so. Ready as I'll ever be, I suppose. Is it gonna hurt? And how long will it take? Please tell Leona it’s alright, when it’s done. She’s probably worried sick already.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are ready. It won’t hurt, Cleo. The X-ray is completely painless. It’ll only take a few minutes, and the blood work will be quick as well. I will personally let Leona know as soon as everything is finished and the preliminary results are in. Technician: “Great. If you’ll just follow me this way.” Cleo, try to relax. I’ll be here when you get back. We'll discuss everything once we have the results.
PATIENT: Okay… alright. Tell Leona I said hi.
DOCTOR: I will, Cleo. We’ll be right here. .
PATIENT: .
