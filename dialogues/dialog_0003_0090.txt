DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. I believe this is a clearance appointment? It feels a bit strange explaining, honestly. My memory… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A surgery, right. Yes, this is a pre-operative clearance appointment. We need to ensure you are fit for the procedure. Though, frankly, it’s often a formality. Details are key, Ms. Brightful. And if your memory is… compromised, we'll have to work a little harder to get them. What surgery are you scheduled for, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a tummy tuck. Yes, that's right. A tummy tuck. And… I apologize. I should remember these things. It's been… a difficult few years. I think it's scheduled for… next month? Or the month after? I’m terribly sorry. Is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: Next month, or the month after… Adequate, but imprecise. We'll need a concrete date. Do you happen to have any documentation regarding the surgery – a letter from your surgeon, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Documentation… I thought I had it. Let me see… There's a receipt… from the consultation fee. And a card with the surgeon's name – Dr. Ramirez. But no letter, I’m afraid. I… I believe they sent something electronically? To my email? I haven't been very diligent about checking my email lately. I'm so sorry to be difficult. Perhaps Dr. Ramirez's office can resend it? Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Resending the documentation is… preferable. While we wait, let’s attempt to establish a baseline. Tell me, Ms. Brightful, what is the primary reason you are seeking this surgery?
PATIENT: It… it’s about feeling like myself again, Doctor. After… after my husband passed, I… well, I wasn’t very good at taking care of myself. And… things changed. Physically, I mean. It’s more than vanity, though it's hard to explain. It's about regaining a sense of… control, I suppose. And confidence. It feels very silly, saying it out loud. It's just… I want to feel comfortable in my own skin again.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Though, I must say, aesthetic motivations are rarely the sole factor. Now, regarding your medical history… have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My general practitioner, Dr. Silva, always said I had… slightly high cholesterol. Nothing major, just something to keep an eye on. And… I think I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but it cleared up with antibiotics. Otherwise… no, I don’t believe so. I’m generally quite healthy, or I was, before… everything. It's very hard to remember details sometimes, I’m afraid. Would Dr. Silva’s office be able to provide you with a more comprehensive medical record?
DOCTOR: A request to Dr. Silva's office is… advisable. And frankly, necessary. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Brightful?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches. But that's… very infrequent. Maybe once a month, if that? I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It always makes me feel… sluggish. Are you noting all of this down? I apologize for being so vague. It's frustrating, not being able to recall things properly.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, occasional ibuprofen. Noted. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No known drug allergies, I don’t believe. I have a mild sensitivity to pollen in the spring, but it's just sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. And… oh! Shellfish. I had a very unpleasant reaction to shrimp a few years ago. It made me quite ill. It was… a very long time ago. That's all I can think of right now. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: Shellfish allergy. Documented. Now, Ms. Brightful, let's briefly discuss your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband… he tried it once, many years ago, and I… I couldn't abide it. The smell… it was awful. And I’ve always been very careful about my health. Or, as careful as I could be. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps two or three times a week. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. Noted. Now, finally, let us briefly touch on your family medical history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure. And… I believe my grandfather had some sort of heart condition. But… it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to either of them. My family… wasn't very forthcoming about health matters. It was… a bit of a taboo subject, I think. Would it be possible to contact a surviving relative? Perhaps a cousin? I don't recall their name, unfortunately. It’s all so… hazy. I’m terribly sorry. It feels like I'm failing this entire examination.
DOCTOR: Ms. Brightful, given your… incomplete recollection of your medical history, and the lack of documentation, I am hesitant to provide clearance for surgery at this time. We need a more comprehensive picture of your overall health to ensure your safety. I recommend we postpone the procedure until we can obtain records from Dr. Silva and any available family members. I will also require a full blood work panel, including a CBC, metabolic panel, and lipid profile, before proceeding. We need concrete data, not vague recollections. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. I… I understand. It’s just… I was so hopeful. I had everything planned. But yes, of course. Records… blood work… anything. Whatever it takes. I want to be safe. Do you think… do you think it will be a long delay? And… will my surgeon be informed? I don’t want to cause any trouble for Dr. Ramirez. This is all so… overwhelming. .
DOCTOR: We will contact Dr. Ramirez's office to inform them of the situation. The length of the delay depends on how quickly we can obtain your medical records. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We will make every effort to expedite the process. Do not worry. And to reiterate, Ms. Brightful, your safety is paramount. Please, ensure you prioritize following up on obtaining these records. .
