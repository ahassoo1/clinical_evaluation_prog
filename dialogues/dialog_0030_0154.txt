DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Oh, dear. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening again and again, and it’s… uncomfortable. I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. Just… recently, I think. I just want it to stop happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. I understand. It sounds frustrating to have ongoing issues with your bladder. When you say “happening again and again,” could you describe what that means specifically?
PATIENT: Well… I have to go to the bathroom. A lot. More than usual, certainly. And it… burns, sometimes. And feels… heavy. Down there. It’s a pain, truly. I’m not a young woman anymore, you see. And it just feels… wrong. I’ve been trying to drink less water, but… it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Claudene. It’s helpful to have a clearer picture. So, frequent urination, a burning sensation, and a feeling of heaviness. Has the burning sensation been consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. But when it does happen… it's quite unpleasant. It’s… hard to explain. It’s like… fire. A small fire, but persistent. And it makes me feel… shaky. I try to ignore it, but it’s difficult. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to feel normal again, Claudene, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on. Aside from the burning, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don't recall. I try not to look, you see. It’s… unpleasant. I suppose… maybe? Once or twice, I think. It was very faint, if it was there at all. I’m not sure. It could have been my imagination. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. It's alright if you're unsure. We can certainly investigate that possibility. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I’ve noticed. I get a bit warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, I think. It’s been terribly hot lately. And chills… no, not really. My back… sometimes aches, but I have old bones, you see. I put that down to getting older. It's just… general discomfort. Nothing specific, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Claudene. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or any bladder issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… that’s a hard one. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, you see. Lived a long life, I have. I… I don't remember any specific diagnoses, no. I had a touch of the flu once, I think. And my gallbladder, they took that out years ago. But nothing… nothing about my waterworks, as such. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant. And not insured, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. That's helpful information. And thank you for sharing about your insurance situation; we will certainly keep that in mind as we discuss options. Regarding your gallbladder removal – do you recall roughly when that was performed?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Years ago. A long time ago. Maybe… thirty years? More? I really can’t say for certain. It was at a different hospital, in a different town. Before… before my divorce, I think. It was a… routine thing, the doctor said. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Claudene. We don't need an exact date. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of kidney problems, bladder issues, or any other significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… family. That’s… complicated. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. And my brother… he had trouble with his stomach, but that was a long time ago. I don’t… I don’t really know much about their medical histories, to be honest. We weren’t very close, you see. It’s… best not to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Claudene. That's perfectly alright. Now, I'd like to ask about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Nothing at all. I don't take anything. I try to stay natural, you see. Just a bit of olive oil sometimes, for my joints. And a glass of wine with my dinner, on occasion. But that’s it. No pills, no fancy medicines. I prefer to let nature take its course.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do, you see. And I don’t like being poked and prodded, if I’m honest. But… if it’s necessary, then go ahead. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… a little. Just a twinge. Here, on the left side. It’s not… sharp, exactly. More like… a dull ache. It comes and goes. I usually just ignore it. But it’s a bit more noticeable when you press. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Claudene. That’s helpful. I’m just tapping on your abdomen now. Okay. And your reflexes seem normal. I’m going to ask you to provide a urine sample, if you’re able. That will help us rule out an infection or other issues. There’s a cup in the restroom. Are you able to do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine sample? Well… I suppose I can manage that. It’s a bit… embarrassing, isn’t it? But if it’s necessary… yes, I’ll go do that now. Where is the restroom, please? And… is there anywhere to wash my hands afterwards?
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene. It’s perfectly understandable to feel a bit embarrassed, but it’s a very routine part of the exam. The restroom is just down the hall to your right. There's soap and warm water for washing your hands afterwards. Take your time, and just bring the cup back to me when you're finished. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be as quick as I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. Okay. We’ll send this off to the lab. It should give us some answers in a few minutes. While we wait, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to garden a lot, you see. Roses, mostly. I didn't get stung by any bees, if that’s what you mean. Just a bit of pollen sometimes, but nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. That’s good to know. Okay. The results are back. There’s evidence of a urinary tract infection, or UTI. That explains the burning sensation and frequent urination. The levels aren’t extremely high, but it’s enough to warrant treatment. Do you have any history of frequent UTIs?
PATIENT: Oh… a UTI? Well, that explains things, I suppose. Frequent… no, not really. I’ve had a bit of trouble with my waterworks lately, as I said, but nothing… this often. Just a nagging feeling, really. I thought it was just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: It's common to experience changes as we age, Claudene, but a UTI is definitely something we need to address. We'll start you on a course of antibiotics. I'm going to prescribe Trimethoprim 980mg twice a day for three days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better, to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Trimethoprim… twice a day for three days. Oh dear. Pills. I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. But… if it’s the only way to get rid of this infection, then I suppose I must. Will it make me feel… sick? I don't have a strong stomach, you see.
DOCTOR: Trimethoprim is generally well-tolerated, Claudene, but some people do experience mild side effects like nausea or stomach upset. Taking it with food can help minimize those effects. And staying well-hydrated is always a good idea. If you experience any severe side effects, like a rash or difficulty breathing, please contact the clinic immediately. I'm printing out the prescription now. It's good for thirty days, but try to start it as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about taking the medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A rash… difficulty breathing? That sounds… frightening. I’ll be very careful, you can be sure. And I’ll take it with my dinner, then. Hopefully that will help. Thirty days, you say? That’s a long time, even if I do finish the course. Will this… happen again? Is there anything I can do to prevent it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking about prevention, Claudene. While we can’t guarantee it won’t happen again, there are things you can do to reduce your risk. Drink plenty of water—about six to eight glasses a day—to help flush out your urinary tract. And try to urinate when you feel the urge, don’t hold it in. Also, wiping from front to back after using the restroom can help prevent bacteria from entering your urethra. Here’s the prescription. I'll also give you a handout with more information about UTIs and prevention tips. And remember, if your symptoms don't improve within a couple of days, or if they worsen, please contact us right away. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh… six to eight glasses of water. That sounds like a lot. But I’ll try my best. Wiping… yes, I remember my mother telling me that. It’s good to have reminders. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your help. And for being patient with my… forgetfulness. It’s nice to have some answers, at least.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. It's my pleasure. And don't worry about your memory – it's perfectly normal to have a few lapses as we get older. We’re here to help. If you have any concerns or questions after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re always happy to assist you. Get well soon, Claudene.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
