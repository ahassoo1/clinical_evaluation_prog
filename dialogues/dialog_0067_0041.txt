DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… my legs, they are getting weaker. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it's getting harder to walk. The other doctors, they said it’s… something with my nerves. Multiple… sclerosis, was it? I just want to know what’s going to happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore, I understand. It sounds concerning to have increasing weakness in your legs, and it’s good you’re seeking answers. Multiple sclerosis is a possibility, but let’s gather some more information to get a clearer picture. First, can you tell me a little more about how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, maybe… two years ago? At first, it was just a little clumsy. I would trip sometimes, or feel a bit unsteady. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But then it started happening more often. And now… now I need a cane just to get around. It’s been getting worse the last six months, for sure. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it started gradually about two years ago, with some clumsiness and unsteadiness, and has become more noticeable, especially in the last six months requiring a cane. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like I can’t move my legs, exactly. It’s more like… they don’t want to. They feel heavy, and… tired. Like they’re not listening to my brain. And sometimes, they feel… numb. Not all the time, but sometimes. Especially when I try to walk for a long time. It's mostly in my legs, but I’ve been feeling a little… shaky in my hands too, lately. Not as bad as my legs, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy, tired feeling, like they aren't responding well, with some numbness, particularly with prolonged walking. And some shakiness in your hands, though less severe. That’s very helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, actually. My vision… it gets blurry sometimes. Not all the time, and it comes and goes. And… I get tired easily. More tired than I used to, even just doing things around the house. My wife says I seem… slower. And I have trouble remembering things sometimes. Not big things, just… names, or where I put my glasses. Which is ironic, isn’t it? I forget where I put my glasses! It’s not every day, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision that comes and goes, increased fatigue, and some memory issues… Okay. It’s good you’re remembering these details, Mr. Astore. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for it, every morning. And… I had a problem with my heart a long time ago, but they fixed it with a… a little machine. A pacemaker, I think they called it. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I used to be a strong swimmer, you know. Still try to go a few times a week, but… it’s getting harder with my legs. My wife worries about me falling in the water.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of a heart condition requiring a pacemaker. That’s important information. And you're still trying to swim, which is great! Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes. They put in the pacemaker, that was a surgery. And… when I was a young man, I broke my arm playing football. They had to put pins in it. Other than those two, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Mostly just… little things. A few stitches here and there when I was a kid. Nothing to worry about now.
DOCTOR: Okay, pacemaker implantation and a prior broken arm that was repaired. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother, she had… arthritis, I think it was. Badly, towards the end. She had trouble walking too, like me. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he was… forgetful. Very forgetful, towards the end. They said it was something with his brain. I don’t know much more than that. It was a long time ago. No one really talked about those things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis and memory issues in the family. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always jokes that I’m a garbage disposal. Never had a reaction to any medicine either. The doctors have given me lots of pills over the years, for my blood pressure and my heart, but I’ve never had a problem. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, are you currently taking any medications, and if so, can you tell me the names and dosages?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I take a pill called… Lisinopril, I think it is. For my blood pressure. I take 20 milligrams, once a day, every morning. And… I take another one called… Metoprolol. For my heart. 50 milligrams, twice a day. That's all. Just those two. I try to remember to take them every day. My wife helps me. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure and Metoprolol 50mg twice daily for your heart. Thank you. Now, Mr. Astore, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s happening, and what we can do about it. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are good, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs and arms. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No problem. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm a little shaky getting up sometimes, so be careful with my legs. I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astore. I will be careful. Okay, your reflexes are normal in your arms, a little diminished in your legs. Your strength is good in your arms, but I’m noticing some weakness in your legs, particularly when lifting your feet and toes. Now, I’m going to check your sensation in your legs and feet. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Yes, I can feel that. But it feels… funny. Not exactly pain, but… numb. And… tingly. Like pins and needles. It’s worse in my feet. Especially my toes. It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. It depends on the day, I think. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. You’re describing a diminished sensation with a tingling, pins-and-needles feeling, particularly in your feet and toes. Now, I’m going to ask you to stand up slowly, and stand with your feet together and your eyes closed. Just for a moment. I’ll be right here to steady you. Okay, that’s alright. That was just to check your balance. It appears you have some difficulty maintaining your balance with your eyes closed. Okay, Mr. Astore, thank you. That completes the physical exam for now. Based on your history and the exam findings, your symptoms of progressive leg weakness, numbness and tingling, balance issues, and blurred vision are concerning for a neurological condition. Given the possibility of multiple sclerosis, as mentioned by other doctors, and your other symptoms, I would like to order some further testing.
PATIENT: That’s what I was afraid of, Doctor. Testing… what kind of testing? Is it going to be painful? I don’t like needles. And… will it take a long time to get the results? I just want to know what’s going on, and what we can do to make it better. My wife is worried sick, and I’m trying to stay positive, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Astore. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about testing, especially when you’re unsure of what to expect. The main test I'd like to order is an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will allow us to look for any lesions or abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. It's a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or surgery. You'll lie inside a large magnet, and it takes about 30-60 minutes. It can be a little loud, but we'll provide you with earplugs. We’ll also order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, like vitamin deficiencies or infections. The blood tests will only involve a small prick of a needle, and it shouldn’t be painful. It usually takes a few days to a week to get the results of the MRI and blood tests. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a plan of action. In the meantime, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nervous system disorders. They will be able to provide you with a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. Would you like me to proceed with the referrals and testing?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Go ahead with the referrals and the testing. I want to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. The sooner we can find out, the better. And… thank you. Thank you for listening, and for taking the time to explain everything. My wife will be very relieved to know we’re getting things sorted out. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Any special instructions? I’m a little worried about the magnet… will it mess with my pacemaker?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. That’s a very important question about your pacemaker! Yes, you must inform the MRI technician about your pacemaker before the scan. They will take special precautions to ensure it doesn’t interfere with the scan. You’ll need to bring your pacemaker identification card with you to the appointment. Otherwise, there's not much you need to do to prepare for the MRI. You can eat and drink normally. You can take your medications as usual. Just remove any metal objects, like jewelry, watches, and dentures, before the scan. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, fax the referrals to a couple of neurologists in the area, and she’ll also schedule a call to set up the MRI appointment. She’ll also give you a list of things to bring to both appointments. I’m confident we'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Astore. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Thank you again. I’ll wait to hear from your nurse, Sarah. And I’ll be sure to bring my pacemaker card. My wife will be happy to know we’ve got a plan. Hopefully, it’s not too serious. But… whatever it is, I’m ready to face it. I've lived a long life, and I’m not afraid. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for your kindness. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Mr. Astore. I admire your positive attitude and strength. Please remember that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Sarah will be in touch shortly. .
