DOCTOR: Hi Reneisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount recently, and I haven’t changed anything about my diet or exercise. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest. I'd like to find out what might be causing it, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight changes can be concerning, especially when your habits haven’t changed. We’ll definitely try to figure out what's going on. “Considerable amount” is a bit vague, though – could you give me a rough estimate of how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Let me think… approximately 18 pounds, I would say. It began around… March, perhaps? So, about five months now. It wasn’t rapid at first, just a pound or two a month, but it’s picked up pace recently. I weighed myself this morning, and that's when I decided I really needed to see someone. I do apologize for not having a precise figure before today, but I don’t usually weigh myself regularly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Reneisha. That’s perfectly alright. 18 pounds over five months, and increasing recently… that's good information to start with. Have you noticed any other changes along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been feeling… more tired than usual, I suppose. Not debilitatingly so, but I find myself needing naps more often in the afternoons. And I’ve been… a bit colder, even when the house is warm. It’s difficult to explain. Just a general feeling of being… off. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue and feeling cold can be important clues. Let's go through a bit more detail. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. My hair is… well, it’s the same as always, perhaps a bit more brittle, but that could be the change in seasons. My skin feels normal. I do moisturize regularly, though. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I apologize if that sounds foolish.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Reneisha, it’s good you’re thinking about it. Just checking for things like dryness, paleness, or any unusual rashes. Okay. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: It's… normal, I believe. I haven't been eating significantly more or less than usual. I enjoy my meals, certainly, but I haven't noticed any cravings or loss of appetite. I eat three meals a day, and occasionally a small snack, like a piece of fruit. Nothing out of the ordinary. My husband would be quick to tell you I still enjoy my cooking!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything chronic. I have regular check-ups with my family doctor, but he's never mentioned any concerns. I did have a rather difficult birth with my daughter, almost thirty years ago now, but I recovered fully. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about your general health. And yes, a difficult birth can sometimes have long-term effects, so it’s good you mentioned it. Now, do you take any medications regularly – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. My husband takes medication for his blood pressure, but I don’t handle his prescriptions. I do occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, but very rarely. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Other than that, nothing at all. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but I’ve been rather forgetful about that lately, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. She was diagnosed when she was in her sixties. And my father had heart problems later in life, but he didn’t take particularly good care of himself, if I’m being honest. He smoked for many years, and didn’t eat a healthy diet. My sister is healthy as far as I know, although we don't see each other often. Is that helpful? I apologize if I'm rambling. I just want to provide you with as much information as possible.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Reneisha, you’re doing great. That’s helpful information. Diabetes and heart problems are definitely things to consider. One last question about your history before we move onto a physical exam. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Of course. I live with my husband in a rural area, as you know. I’m a orderly at the local hospital, mostly light cleaning and assisting the nurses. It’s not physically demanding work. We have a small garden, which I enjoy tending to when the weather permits. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol—only a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to walk for about thirty minutes most days, but I haven’t been as diligent lately due to the heat. It's rather… oppressive this summer. I do enjoy reading, and spending time with my grandchildren when they visit. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Okay, Reneisha, based on what you've told me – the unexplained weight gain, fatigue, feeling cold, a family history of diabetes, and your lifestyle – it would be good to do a physical exam and run a few basic blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. Whatever you think is best. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I am eager to find out what might be causing this.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, so I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid gland, and feel your abdomen. I’ll also check your reflexes and blood pressure. After that, I'd like to draw some blood for a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel. That will give us a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I do not. No allergies at all, thankfully. Latex or alcohol, neither bother me. I’m ready whenever you are, Doctor. I do hope it won’t take too long. My husband is expecting me back shortly. Although, he understands these things take time, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Okay, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. I don’t feel any nodules. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Blood pressure is 130/80, and reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable, which is good, but doesn't explain the weight gain. Now, I just need to draw a small amount of blood.
PATIENT: Very well. That all sounds… reassuring, I suppose, even if it doesn't provide an answer. Yes, let's proceed with the blood draw. I do hope it won't be too painful. I’m not particularly fond of needles. But I understand it’s necessary. Do let me know if you need me to look away or anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as gentle as possible. And please, tell me immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay, this might sting for just a moment. Please relax your arm. Okay, all done. There you go. Just keep gentle pressure on that for a few minutes, and you’ll be all set. It's important not to bend your arm for a bit. I'll send these off to the lab right away. The results should be back in a few days—usually around three to five business days. We’ll call you as soon as we have them.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t as bad as I feared, thankfully. I will be sure to keep pressure on it, and avoid bending my arm. Three to five business days… I shall try to be patient. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any dietary changes or anything I should be avoiding? Or is it simply a matter of waiting for the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad it wasn’t too unpleasant. For now, I don’t want you to make any drastic changes to your diet or activity level. We need a baseline to compare the results to. Continue eating your usual meals and try to maintain your regular level of activity, as long as you feel comfortable. It's best not to change anything until we have a better understanding of what's going on. Just continue to monitor your symptoms and let us know if anything changes significantly before the results come back. We'll discuss everything in detail once we have the lab results, and then we can formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Waiting is never easy, but I feel reassured knowing you’re investigating this properly. Thank you again for your time. I believe that’s all. Perhaps you have many other patients waiting? I wouldn’t want to take up any more of your valuable time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. And you're right, I do have a few other patients to see. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
