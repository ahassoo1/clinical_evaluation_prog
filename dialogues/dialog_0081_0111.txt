DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea why I’m here, beyond my wife insisting. Something about my… complexion? And feeling rather tired, I suppose. It’s all quite bothersome, really. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: "Complexion" and tiredness. Alright. Well, let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness. It's…darker. My skin. I'm usually not so… wan. And I tire easily. Used to be able to work a full day, reinforcing iron, you understand. Now…a bit of a struggle. Is that specific enough? Really, I haven't the time for endless descriptions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, medical evaluations require details. When did you first notice this change in your skin color?
PATIENT: Details, details. Honestly, young man, you doctors and your…details. When did I notice it? Hmm…weeks, perhaps? Months? It’s all a blur. Time isn’t what it used to be, you know. Before the heat started, I believe. It was…cooler then, certainly. And I was working more consistently. Is that a detail you require? Honestly, this is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see you’ve been seen here previously. Let's see…previous notes indicate some complaints of fatigue six months ago, attributed to possible anemia. And some monitoring of blood pressure. Now, about this change in skin color…has it been all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Anemia? Blood pressure? My wife handles all of that. I simply feel unwell. As for the…darkening, it seems to be…everywhere, I believe. Yes, everywhere. My hands, certainly. And my face, I suppose. Though it’s difficult to say with certainty. I don’t spend much time admiring my complexion, you see. Really, is this necessary? Is it…serious?
DOCTOR: “Everywhere” is still rather vague, Mr. Drahota, but alright. And yes, it could be serious, which is why I'm asking these questions. We need to rule out a number of possibilities. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? No. Absolutely not. I simply feel tired and my skin is… less vibrant, shall we say? This is all quite unsettling, really. I’ve led a perfectly respectable life, worked hard. I don’t understand why I must endure this… scrutiny. Are you going to poke me with needles now? Because I really dislike needles.
DOCTOR: No needles just yet, Mr. Drahota. But we do need to proceed with a physical examination, and likely some blood work. I understand your discomfort, but these are standard procedures to determine the cause of your symptoms. Let’s start with a quick look at your skin, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Blood work…of course. Just what I needed. Very well. Get it over with. But be quick about it, Doctor. I have things to attend to. And please, try not to make a mess. My wife gets quite upset about stains.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin feels…slightly thickened in places. The hyperpigmentation is fairly diffuse. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are a little diminished, but otherwise normal. Heart rate is regular. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes. Please relax.
PATIENT: Lymph nodes? What for? I haven’t the slightest idea what lymph nodes are! Are you suggesting I’m… ill? This is becoming quite alarming, Doctor. My wife will be furious if I return home looking like I've been poked and prodded. Get on with it, I suppose. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: I'm assessing all possibilities, Mr. Drahota. Some of your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, though not alarmingly so. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright. I'd like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We'll also need to check your iron levels, just to rule out anemia, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. And… a serum protein electrophoresis, to investigate the potential cause of the skin changes.
PATIENT: Serum…what did you say? Serum protein electro-… That sounds dreadful. And all this blood? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite faint. Is all of this absolutely necessary? I thought you said it was just fatigue and…a slightly less vibrant complexion! My wife is going to be so cross. Perhaps I should just rest. Perhaps it’s just a bit of the heat. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your anxiety, but these tests are important to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. The tests are not excessively invasive, and will give us valuable information. If you are feeling faint, we can pause for a moment. However, delaying diagnosis could potentially worsen any underlying condition. I recommend we proceed with the blood work now, and we can discuss the results in detail when they are available.
