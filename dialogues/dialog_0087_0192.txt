DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first, see if I’m… you know… good enough. Not really sure why they need all this done, but here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. A pre-placement physical for the military. We'll certainly do our best to fulfill their requirements. To start, could you tell me a little more about which branch of the military, and what position you are applying for, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Don’t really see why that matters, but alright. It’s the… Air Force. Want to be a mechanic. Engine stuff. Always been good with machines. Seems pretty straightforward, honestly. Not like I’m trying to be a fighter pilot or somethin’.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Different positions have different physical standards, so it is relevant. Let’s start with a general overview of your health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Look, I’m 51. Things ache. But serious problems? Not really. Had the flu a few times, broke my wrist when I was a kid falling off a bike. Nothing major. No heart stuff, no diabetes, no nothin’ like that. I eat alright, don’t smoke, maybe a beer now and then. You know, normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. Wrist was just a cast. Never needed to go under the knife or spend a night in a hospital. Lucky, I guess. Though my wife says I’m stubborn and that’s why I don’t go to the doctor unless somethin’ is really broken. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good to be healthy, and wives often have good instincts. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let’s see. My father had high blood pressure towards the end, but he smoked like a chimney, so, not surprised. Mother was… alright. Just old age, really. My sister has… allergies, I think? Nothing scary. No one with heart problems or cancer or anything like that, if that's what you're getting at. Pretty normal family, really. Don’t see why I need a whole family medical history for a simple exam.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have a complete picture, Mr. Hartness, even if everything appears normal. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. No pills. Nothing. I don’t believe in takin’ stuff unless I absolutely have to. And no, I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. I can take ibuprofen if I need it for a headache, but that’s about it. Simple as that. Honestly, I feel pretty good for my age. Probably better than half these young guys runnin' around these days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, let’s move on to a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know. Not all day to sit around in a doctor's office. Heart and lungs, you say? Alright. Just don’t poke me too much. I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. No needles at this stage, Mr. Hartness. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s within a normal range, though the blood pressure is a bit elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths.
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? Probably just nervous being here. I don’t usually go to doctors. Deep breaths, you say? What are you listenin’ for, anyway? Is somethin’ wrong? Don’t tell me I got a hole in my lung or somethin’. I need both of those to be a mechanic.
DOCTOR: I'm listening for any unusual sounds – murmurs, wheezing, crackles – that could indicate a problem. It's just a routine part of the examination. I’m hearing clear breath sounds bilaterally, which is good. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's a relatively common finding, often benign, but it warrants further investigation. To get a better understanding of this murmur, and to ensure you are fit for duty, I recommend an EKG and a chest X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An… ECG? And an X-ray? What for? A murmur? Sounds serious. Look, I told you, I’m fine. My heart’s always been good. I work with engines all day, I gotta be strong. I don’t need fancy tests just because you hear a little… somethin’. Is this gonna disqualify me? Because if it is, I'm not botherin’ with it. It’s just a job, after all. I don’t need their permission to turn a wrench.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hartness. The murmur itself isn't necessarily a cause for alarm, but the Air Force has specific medical standards that must be met. The EKG and chest X-ray will help us determine the cause of the murmur and rule out any underlying heart condition. It’s a precautionary measure. It's possible the tests will come back normal, and you'll be cleared without any further issues. However, to be certain, and to fulfill the requirements of the pre-placement physical, it’s important to complete these tests. Without them, I cannot confidently certify you as fit for duty. I would hate for you to go through with the application process, only to be disqualified later. We can schedule these tests at the clinic, and I can discuss the results with you as soon as they are available. Would you be willing to proceed with the EKG and chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. But if it’s a waste of time and money, I'm holdin’ you personally responsible. And don't tell me it's "standard procedure" again. I don't like bein’ poked and prodded, and I don't like havin’ my time wasted. Just get it over with, and let's hope nothin' comes of it. Schedule the… ECG and the X-ray. But I'm not missin’ work for this again if it's nothin’. Do you understand? I’ve got a schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Hartness. We’ll schedule the tests as efficiently as possible, minimizing any disruption to your schedule. We’ll also do our best to expedite the results. I will personally review them and discuss them with you as soon as they are available. I'll have the scheduling department contact you to set up appointments. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… get the tests done. And don't bother me unless there's somethin’ wrong. I gotta get back to work.
