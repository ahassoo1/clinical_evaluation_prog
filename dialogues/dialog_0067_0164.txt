DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too. Well, it’s… a bit strange, really. I get really sick after I eat fava beans. Like, really yellow, and tired, and just awful. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I thought I should get it checked out. I don’t even really know what’s wrong, just that fava beans seem to be the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. And it sounds quite unpleasant. So, you're experiencing some kind of reaction specifically after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It's not everything I eat, just those beans. It started a few years ago, maybe five? At first, I didn’t connect it, I just thought I had a bad stomach bug. But then it happened again, and again… and each time it was after I’d had fava beans. It makes me feel so weak, and my skin gets… well, yellow, like a lemon.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s get some more details. Five years ago… and you mentioned feeling weak and noticing a yellowing of your skin. That yellowing… is that all over, or just in certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s mostly my skin, yeah. And my eyes, they look really white, but kind of…yellowish too. Not bright yellow, but you can definitely see it. It goes away after a few days, once I stop eating anything… well, anything at all, really. I just don't feel like eating when I'm that sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, this happens every time you eat fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes. Every single time. It doesn’t matter how much I eat, even just a few. It’s…consistent, which is why I started to worry. I mean, it’s not normal to get sick like that from a vegetable, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not typical, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. This is giving me something specific to consider. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the weakness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my pee gets really dark, like tea. And I feel a bit… short of breath, if I try to do anything too strenuous. Not always, but when I'm really bad, definitely. Oh, and sometimes my heart races a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark urine, shortness of breath with exertion, and a racing heart…those are important details. Have you ever been told you have anemia before?
PATIENT: Anemia? No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing…serious. I’ve never had any blood tests or anything like that. I’m generally quite healthy, to be honest. It’s just this bean thing!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, with the symptoms you're describing—the reaction to fava beans, the yellowing of the skin, the dark urine, shortness of breath, and racing heart—it sounds like we need to investigate something called G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition where the body doesn’t have enough of an enzyme that protects red blood cells, and certain things, like fava beans, can trigger a reaction. Does that sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't sound familiar at all. G6PD… I've never heard of it. A genetic condition… oh dear. Is it… serious? And what do they do about it? I’m a little worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried. It can be serious, but it’s also manageable for many people. Essentially, people with G6PD deficiency need to avoid things that trigger a reaction—like fava beans in your case. It doesn’t affect everyone the same way, and many people live completely normal lives once they know what to avoid. To confirm if this is what's going on, we'll need to do a blood test to check your G6PD levels. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. A blood test sounds… sensible. Anything to figure out what's going on. And if avoiding fava beans is all I have to do, that’s…a relief, really. I mean, I don’t love them, so it wouldn’t be the end of the world.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m ordering a G6PD level test, as well as a complete blood count - that will give us a baseline of your red blood cells. We’ll also check your bilirubin levels, which can help explain the yellowing of your skin. It’s a fairly standard blood draw; the phlebotomist will just need to access a vein in your arm. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds pretty straightforward, thank you. So, just a normal blood draw? And the results will tell us if this G6PD thing is the problem? I’m glad you’re looking into it. I’ve been a bit worried about it for a while, just dismissing it as a weird allergy, but it’s good to get it checked properly.
DOCTOR: That’s right – just a normal blood draw. The results will help us determine if G6PD deficiency is the cause of your symptoms. And you’re very welcome; it's always best to get things checked properly. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to also ask a little bit about your family history, if that’s okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's fine. My family… well, my mother was Romanian, and my father was… Irish, I think. They both came from pretty big families. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest; they weren’t really the type to talk about illnesses.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. It’s good to know. We’re just trying to see if there’s any history of similar symptoms, or any known blood disorders in your family. Has anyone in your family ever been diagnosed with anemia, jaundice, or had problems with their gallbladder?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandmother on my mother's side… she was always quite pale, I remember. And she used to get really tired easily. I don’t think she was ever officially diagnosed with anything, but she was often weak. And… I think my uncle on my father’s side had some stomach problems. He had a lot of pain and had to have… something removed from his gallbladder, maybe? I'm really not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Pale grandmother with fatigue and an uncle with gallbladder issues. Those could be relevant. Do you have any siblings or children?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any siblings or children. I'm an only child, and… I never got around to having any myself. It just didn't happen. So it's just me, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just one last quick question before we move on to your social history - do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to any medications or foods, other than the reaction you get with fava beans?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medications. Just over-the-counter things if I have a headache, like ibuprofen. And no, I don’t have any allergies to any other foods, or any medications that I know of. Apart from the beans, of course!
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No regular medications and no known allergies besides the fava beans. Now, let's briefly talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that's it. And no, I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I'm a pretty healthy person, as you know, apart from this bean situation!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful. So, to recap, we’re investigating a possible G6PD deficiency due to your reaction to fava beans. We've ordered a G6PD level test and a complete blood count to get a clearer picture. You’ve mentioned a history of fatigue in your grandmother and gallbladder issues in your uncle. You don’t take any regular medications, don’t smoke, and rarely drink alcohol. Now, while we wait for the results, it's best to avoid fava beans completely. I'm going to give you a list of foods to watch out for, as they can sometimes contain hidden fava bean ingredients. Is there anything else you want to discuss or any other symptoms you've been experiencing that we haven't covered?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, thank you. The list of foods would be really helpful, because I wouldn't even know where to start looking. And no, I think you've covered everything, really. I'm just relieved that we're finally getting to the bottom of it. I've been worrying about it for so long, just thinking I was a bit odd!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here’s that list of foods to avoid, and it also includes some common names for fava beans in different cuisines. The lab results should be back in a few days. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like severe fatigue, jaundice , dark urine, or shortness of breath—please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about anything we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all very clear. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and investigate this. I feel much better knowing what we're looking for and that it might have a name. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help. It’s always best to get to the bottom of these things, and you're right, having a name for it makes a big difference. We'll get those results back to you as soon as possible. Feel free to call if any concerns come up. Have a good day.
