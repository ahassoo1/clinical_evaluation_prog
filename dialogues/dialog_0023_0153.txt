DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. Something about a… check-up? For… work, I think. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They just said I needed to get something signed off on. Performance clearance, maybe? I work at the theater, you see. Mostly ushering, tickets… that sort of thing. Old man's work, really.
DOCTOR: A performance clearance, alright. And you're saying this is a requirement from your employer, the theater?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. They… well, they want to make sure I'm still able to… stand, I suppose. And see. It’s a bit silly, really. I’ve been doing this for years. But rules are rules, I guess. I just want to get this over with quickly if we could. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, we can certainly try to be efficient. To get started, let’s go over your medical history. Have you seen a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: A primary… oh, you mean a regular doctor? Not really, no. Never had much need for one, to be honest. Just the occasional… aches and pains. Old age, you know? I usually just… dealt with it. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Years, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. Not for anything serious, anyway. When I was a boy… a bad case of the flu, maybe? But nothing as an adult. Just the usual bumps and bruises. I’m a careful man, mostly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. No surgeries. Never needed any. I’ve been quite lucky, I think. Just… a bit of a bad knee now and then. But nothing that required… cutting. Definitely no cutting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family… that's a tricky one. My parents… they passed a long time ago. I wasn’t very close to them, and I don’t really… remember much about their health, truthfully. I think my mother… maybe high blood pressure? But I'm not sure. I really wouldn't know, doctor. I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright, we'll proceed as best we can. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. And I haven't taken any medicine in ages, so… I haven't had anything to be allergic to. I don’t recall ever having a reaction to anything, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a single one. I prefer to… let nature take its course, you see. Old-fashioned, I suppose. I don’t believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. Just a bit of tea now and then for a sore throat. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical examination. I’ll need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. The scale, right. I suspect I’ve lost a bit of weight, actually. These old bones don’t hold what they used to.
DOCTOR: 118 pounds. And your height is listed as 199 centimeters. That’s… quite low for your height, Mr. Krahn. Now, if you’ll please step back, I'll check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh, is it? I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a very long time. I suppose I should eat more. Too much worry, maybe? It makes you lose your appetite, you know. Go ahead, doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 158 over 92. Elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, if you could just turn around, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath or chest pain, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Sometimes, when I climb the stairs at the theater, I get a little… winded. But that's to be expected, isn't it? Old age, like I said. Chest pain… no, no pain. Just a bit… tight sometimes. But I figured that was indigestion. The theater food isn't what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Now that you mention it… yes, a little. I thought it was just from standing for long hours at the theater. Especially during the busy shows. It goes down when I sit and put my feet up. But it’s been happening more lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your elevated blood pressure, diminished breathing sounds, and swelling in your ankles, I'm concerned about potential cardiac and pulmonary issues. I recommend further investigation. We'll need to run some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel – and I'd also like to order a chest X-ray and an electrocardiogram. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood tests? X-rays? I… I don’t know. Is it serious? I just needed a signature for my work. I didn’t want all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, while a signature may be your immediate concern, your health is paramount. These tests are necessary to determine the underlying cause of these findings. Ignoring them could lead to more serious complications down the line. I understand your reluctance, but I strongly advise against delaying this investigation. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Tests… I… I don’t understand what any of those are. And… honestly, doctor, I don’t have insurance. I retired a long time ago, and it’s… expensive. Can’t I just… get the signature somehow? Is there another way? I really don't want to get into a lot of trouble with the hospital bills.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your financial concerns. However, I am ethically obligated to provide you with the necessary care to assess and address your health issues. Given your lack of insurance, we can discuss options for financial assistance or potentially explore a payment plan with the hospital. As for getting a signature without proper assessment, that would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental to your health. I cannot, in good conscience, simply sign off on a form without knowing the state of your condition. I can refer you to a social worker who can assist you with navigating financial aid options for these tests. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A social worker… yes, I suppose so. Anything to… to make this easier. It's just… a lot. All this fuss over an old man who ushers people to their seats. But… alright. A social worker. And… could they maybe explain what all those tests are? I feel like I’m talking to a different language sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will arrange for a referral to a social worker who specializes in assisting patients with limited insurance. They can explain the tests, the costs, and potential financial aid programs. I will also have my nurse provide you with a written summary of my findings and the rationale for these investigations before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, doctor. I suppose. It’s… a lot to take in. And… thank you for being patient with an old man who doesn’t understand everything.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krahn. My nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork and the referral information. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions. I will also review your results as soon as they become available. Stop by and have a seat and she’ll be with you shortly.
