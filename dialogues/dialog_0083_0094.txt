DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I think… the lady on the phone said come for… talking? Just talking about… things. I don't really remember. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes it’s hard to keep track of everything. No problem at all. So, your husband scheduled this appointment for you. Perhaps we can start by you telling me what's been on your mind lately?
PATIENT: On my mind… hmm. Work, mostly. Sheet metal is… heavy. And loud. It’s not like it used to be, you know? Everything is… faster now. More things to do. My back aches a lot. But everyone aches, right? It’s just… work.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine sheet metal work would be physically demanding. And a faster pace certainly adds to that. You mentioned your back aches a lot. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about it… well, it’s just… sore. All the time. Worse when I bend over, or lift things. Like, the big sheets of metal. Sometimes it feels like a… a sharp pain. Not all the time, just… sometimes. It’s been like this for… a while now. I don’t keep track of dates. My husband says I should, but… I forget.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common to feel aches and pains with physically demanding work. And it can be difficult to keep track of things when you're busy. You mentioned the pain is worse when bending or lifting, and sometimes sharp. Is the pain localized to a specific area of your back, or does it radiate anywhere else – like down your legs or into your hips?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that mean? It just… hurts. Mostly in my lower back. Like… right here. Sometimes it feels… tight. Like a muscle is all… knotted up. It doesn't go down my legs, no. Just… stays there. It's annoying, that's all. My husband keeps telling me to see a doctor, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. "Radiate" just means whether the pain spreads from your back to other areas. So, it's staying localized to your lower back, which is good. And you describe it as tight, like a knotted muscle. Has anything specific made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse recently… hmm. Oh! Last week, we had a really big job. Lots of… fancy curves. Bending metal all day. That made it much worse. I had to take some… pills. Not doctor pills. The ones from the store. They help a little, but not really. Then it just… feels like it’s always there again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain flared up with that heavier workload last week, and the over-the-counter medication provides only partial relief. What kind of over-the-counter medication are you taking, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Uh… the red ones. The big bottle. It says… pain reliever. I don't really look at the names. My husband buys them. He says they're good for aches. They don’t really fix it, but they take the edge off. A little.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s helpful that they provide some relief, even if it’s not a complete fix. To get a better understanding of what's going on, would you mind if I did a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? Like… poking and prodding? I don’t like being poked and prodded. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s a very gentle exam, Ms. Fontanazza. I’ll just be checking your range of motion, feeling your back for tenderness, and doing a few simple tests to see how your muscles and nerves are functioning. It will help me determine the cause of your pain and the best way to help you. It's not required, but it will give me a much clearer picture of what's going on. We can skip it if you prefer, but it might delay getting you the right treatment.
PATIENT: Treatment… that’s what I want. I just want it to stop hurting. Okay, fine. Gentle is good. But no… stretching. I hate stretching. And don't push too hard. I get… easily annoyed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle, no stretching, and I’ll respect your limits completely. We’ll go at your pace. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, if you could please lie face down on the exam table, that would be great. I’ll start by just feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Fine. Don't poke too much. And be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. My husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing as much as you can. I’m just feeling along your back… Do you feel any particular tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes! There. That hurts. Like… a sharp pain when you push there. Not all the time, just… when you push.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And is it painful to move your back at all?
PATIENT: Move it? Like… bend over? Ow! Yes. That hurts too. It's tight. Like something is… stuck. I can't bend very far.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And when you straighten back up, does that cause any pain as well?
PATIENT: Yes! It feels like… a pull. Like a muscle is… stretching too much. It's just… uncomfortable. Everything is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just feeling for any muscle spasms. It seems like there is some tightness and spasm on the left side. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Toes are okay. Everything feels tired, but not numb. Just… heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No numbness or tingling. And I’m noting some muscle spasm on the left side of your lower back. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain. The heavy lifting at work, combined with the tightness and spasm, is consistent with that. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… safe? I don’t like those things. My mother said… something about radiation. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. You’re right to be concerned about radiation. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out other potential causes of your pain outweigh the small risk. It will allow us to see if there are any issues with your bones, like a fracture or arthritis. We will use a lead apron to protect the rest of your body. If you’re still uncomfortable with it, we can explore other options, but it would make it harder to get an accurate diagnosis. Would you like me to explain more about the X-ray procedure?
PATIENT: Fine. But quick. And be careful. My husband will be very angry if I take too long. And explain it. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The X-ray itself is very simple. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will position a special plate behind your back and take a few images. It only takes a few minutes. You’ll need to remain still during the process so the images are clear. The technician will explain everything to you beforehand, and they’ll answer any questions you have. The images will be sent to a radiologist, who will review them and send a report to me. Do you have any metal implants or jewelry that can't be removed?
PATIENT: Metal? Oh! My bra. It has… wires. Is that a problem? And… a small pin in my knee. From when I was little. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. Yes, that's good to know. The metal in your bra and your knee pin could interfere with the images, so we'll need to take some extra precautions. The technician will ask you to remove your bra before the X-ray. As for the pin in your knee, it shouldn’t be a major issue, but we'll let the technician know so they can position you appropriately. We might need to take images from different angles to get a clear view of your back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Take my bra off? In front of… strangers? No. No, I don't like that at all. Can't you just… look around it? Or… maybe I’ll just skip the X-ray. I don't want to cause trouble. It's probably just a muscle, right?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Fontanazza. You're right, we can try to work around the bra, but it might affect the quality of the images. We will do everything we can to make you feel comfortable. The technician is trained to be respectful and discreet. And we can certainly proceed without the X-ray, but as you know, it does make it harder to rule out other potential causes of your pain. Without the X-ray, we'll focus on treating it as a muscle strain. That would involve rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers. We can also consider physical therapy if your pain doesn’t improve. I can write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm, if you like. However, it's important to be aware that without a clear diagnosis, we're relying on our best guess. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A pill sounds good. Anything to make it stop hurting. And… maybe the physical therapy. But no running. I hate running. And no poking. Just… gentle. And quick. My husband will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m prescribing a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully, and it might cause some drowsiness, so avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. I’m also writing a referral for physical therapy. You can schedule an appointment with them at your convenience. Please let the therapist know your preference for gentle exercises and no running. Here’s a printout of the prescription and the physical therapy referral. We'll also send a copy to your primary care physician. I recommend resting, applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and continuing to take over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. I want to see you back in two weeks if your pain doesn’t improve, or if it gets worse. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Two weeks… okay. No, I think that's all. Just… stop hurting. And thank you. I have to go now. My husband will be angry.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I hope you feel better soon. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And I hope your husband isn’t too angry. Have a good day, and take care. .
PATIENT: Bye. .
