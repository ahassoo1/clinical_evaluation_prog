DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. I... I think my husband said something about needing to talk to a doctor. Something about... learning? I don’t really remember. He worries too much. It’s just a check-up, right? Not a big deal?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if you're unsure, Ms. Fontanazza. Sometimes it’s difficult to recall everything. A check-up is always a good idea, and we can certainly do that. However, to ensure I provide you with the best possible care, could you tell me anything at all about what prompted your husband to schedule this appointment?
PATIENT: Prompted? He just… he reads a lot of things online. About… everything. Said I should know more about… my body. Honestly, I work with metal all day. Sheet metal. It's not like I need to know about… insides. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is being proactive about your health, which is commendable. And I assure you, we'll be as efficient as possible with your time. Knowing a little more about your overall health can be helpful, even if you're very active physically, as you are with your work. To get started, perhaps we can simply go over a few general questions?
PATIENT: General questions? Like what? About my job? It's hard work, if that's what you mean. Lots of lifting, and cutting. And it's hot. Very hot. I don't see what that has to do with anything. My husband always makes a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Yes, your work is relevant, Ms. Fontanazza. The physical demands of your job – the lifting, cutting, and heat exposure – can certainly impact your health. It helps me get a complete picture. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… what? Look, I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe since my wedding? I don't remember. I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, but that's just from work. And my back aches. But everyone's back aches when you work with metal all day! My husband worries too much about these things. He's always looking things up on the internet.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common to not have a detailed medical history readily available. And it's perfectly normal to feel tired or have aches and pains, especially with a physically demanding job like yours. Let's try this: have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Why would I be? I just… I work. I go home. I sleep. That’s it. My husband, he… he always thinks something is wrong. He gets scared easily. I’m strong. Sheet metal work, you know. Builds character. And muscles. Definitely muscles.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fontanazza. It sounds like you are a very resilient person. Knowing you haven't been hospitalized is helpful. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… no, not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, mostly. I don't really like shellfish. But that’s just because it tastes funny, not because I’m allergic. My husband tried to get me to eat more vegetables once. It was awful. He keeps trying to change things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fontanazza. That's good to know. No known allergies is helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never took a pill in my life. I don’t believe in all that stuff. If you feel bad, you rest. You drink some water. You work harder. That fixes everything. This is taking a long time. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Fontanazza. No current medications is good to know. Now, if you don’t mind me asking, what is your height and approximate weight?
PATIENT: Ugh. Must we? Really? Okay, fine. I’m… short. Very short. Like, five foot… something. My husband always says I’m petite. And… heavy. Let’s just say I’m… solid. I lift a lot of metal, okay? It’s muscle! Maybe 130, 140? Something like that. It’s not important. I'm strong. That's what matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fontanazza. Knowing your height and weight is helpful. It allows me to get a better understanding of your overall health. Now, perhaps you could tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, boy. Okay. My mother… she had… something with her stomach, I think. She always complained about it. And my father… he worked in a factory, like me. He just… got old, I guess. He just slowed down. They both smoked a lot, if that matters. They’re both gone now. A long time ago. It’s… hard to remember details.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s difficult to recall details about family history, especially after a long time and with loss. Thank you for sharing what you remember. Now, one last few questions. Do you use any tobacco products, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? What kind of question is that? No! Absolutely not. I don't have time for that. I work! I sleep! And sometimes, my husband and I have a small glass of wine with dinner. Just a small one. Maybe a few times a month. He likes it. I don't really care for it. And no, I don't smoke. Never have. Honestly, these questions are a little insulting. I'm a hardworking woman.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Fontanazza. Please understand that I ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health. It's important for me to know about all aspects of your lifestyle, not to judge, but to provide the best possible care. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Ugh. Must I? I told you, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. But… fine. If you must. But don't take too long. I have things to do, you know. Sheet metal doesn’t cut itself. And… please be gentle. I bruise easily. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a little elevated. We can discuss that further in a moment. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slightly diminished breath sounds on both sides. Your ears and throat appear clear. Now, if you could just open your mouth and say "ah..." Your throat looks fine. And one last thing, I’d like to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Okay, Ms. Fontanazza. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Tenderness? In my tummy? That’s probably just from… lifting all the metal. And… twisting. I twist a lot. It’s hard work, you know. It's not just… sitting around. What does it mean? Is something wrong? My husband is going to be so worried. Tell me straight. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's good that you're asking, Ms. Fontanazza. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant can be caused by several things. It could be muscle strain from your work, as you mentioned, but it could also indicate a problem with your gallbladder or liver. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions, but based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I would like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. These tests will check your liver function, gallbladder health, and overall blood count. I also recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to visualize your liver and gallbladder. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Blood tests? This is… a lot. My husband is going to be right. He always thinks something is wrong. Fine. Do the tests. Whatever you think is best. But I don't want to be stuck here all day. And… what if it is something bad? What if I need… surgery? Tell me straight. Is it serious? Is it my gallbladder? He read something about that online, and it sounded terrible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Fontanazza. It's natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. We're not jumping to any conclusions about surgery or a serious diagnosis. The blood tests and ultrasound are simply to gather more information so we can determine the cause of your tenderness and elevated blood pressure. It's possible it could be your gallbladder, but many other things can cause similar symptoms. Until we have the results of the tests, it’s impossible to say for certain. We'll schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning, and the ultrasound can be done later in the week. I’ll explain the results to you as soon as they're available and discuss the best course of action. I want to assure you that we will work together to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. In the meantime, it’s important to stay hydrated and avoid heavy lifting if it causes you pain. If your pain becomes severe, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions? Ugh. Fine. Um… how long will the tests take? And… will they hurt? My husband always says doctors like to poke you. And… can I still work? I have a deadline. I need to finish the metal work. My boss is counting on me. And… will the insurance cover it? We don't have much money. This is a mess. A complete mess.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Fontanazza. Let me address them one by one. The blood tests will only take about 15-20 minutes. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – will use a small needle, and it may cause a brief pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. We'll use a thin needle and be as gentle as possible. The ultrasound will take about 30-45 minutes. A technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a handheld device to create images of your liver and gallbladder. It is a painless procedure. Regarding work, I would advise you to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests and can determine the cause of your pain. I understand you have a deadline, but your health is the priority. We can discuss a note for your boss if needed. Regarding insurance, unfortunately, I do not have information about your specific coverage. However, our billing department is very helpful and can assist you with understanding your coverage and any potential costs. I will have them contact you after the tests to discuss this further. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Billing department? Oh, great. More phone calls. Fine. No, I… I think that’s all. Just… please hurry. I don’t want to be sick. I have things to do. And… tell my husband everything, okay? He worries too much. He’ll want to know all the details. Just… get it over with. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand. We'll get this done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I will make sure your husband is kept informed of all the details, as you requested. Let me walk you to the lab to schedule your blood tests. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. We’re here to help.
