DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be perfectly frank, my wife insisted. She worries too much, if you ask me. I just wanted to get checked for… you know… the HIV. Just to keep her happy, really. It's probably nothing, but she gets these ideas in her head.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good that you're getting it checked out, even if it’s just for peace of mind. And it's very thoughtful of you to come in for your wife. Let’s talk a bit about why she’s concerned. Have you had any reasons to think you might have been exposed to HIV?
PATIENT: Exposed? Honestly, no. Not that I'm aware of. I've been married for fifteen years, and before that... well, let's just say I wasn't running around making questionable choices. She just reads things online, you know? All sorts of stories. It's a waste of everyone's time, if you ask me, but here I am. I assure you, my life is quite…stable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it’s definitely smart to rule things out when there's concern. Just to be thorough, and to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I've always been fairly healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. A bit of the flu now and then, but who doesn’t get the flu? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, probably five years. Maybe longer. Everything usually just… goes away on its own. I don’t bother with it unless it’s really bad, you understand? Waste of money, most of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, generally healthy, haven’t needed to see a doctor much recently. No major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Exactly. No surgeries, no chronic conditions, nothing like that. I eat alright, I suppose. My wife makes sure of that. Though she does go overboard with the vegetables sometimes. And I'm not a big fan of all this “exercise” everyone keeps talking about. A bit of walking is enough for me. Honestly, I'm perfectly fine, it’s just… her worrying. It’s exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And just to cover all bases, are there any allergies I should be aware of – to medications, food, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I'm aware of. I can eat anything. My wife tries to get me to try these fancy spices sometimes, and I’m fine with them all. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not ever. Honestly, I think she makes up allergies for herself just to be difficult. But I don't have any. Perfectly normal, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. A bit of pain? You just have to deal with it. My wife keeps offering me vitamins, but I refuse. All that stuff is just marketing, if you ask me. I’d rather just eat a good meal. So, no, absolutely nothing. Clean as a whistle, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or vitamins. Now, a quick question about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has any major medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My parents both passed away a long time ago. My mother, she had… something with her stomach, I think. But it was ages ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention. My father… he smoked too much, if I remember correctly. Lungs, probably. And my grandparents? Honestly, I barely knew them. We didn’t keep in touch much. It's not something we ever discussed. I doubt any of them were particularly healthy, to be frank. It’s not a strong family when it comes to… well, anything, really. So, not much help there, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Limited information on family history. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I work, I come home, I eat dinner with my wife, I watch a bit of television. It’s not very exciting, if you ask me, but it’s stable. I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I certainly don't… indulge in any sort of reckless behaviour. I'm a very… grounded person, Doctor. Very responsible. I wouldn't describe myself as an adventurous type, not at all. It’s a quiet life, but it suits me perfectly well. I don’t need excitement, I need…order.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet and stable lifestyle. That's good to know. Alright, Jacquille, to address your wife’s concern about HIV, we’ll need to do a blood test. It’s a standard procedure, and it will give us a definitive answer. It’s pretty straightforward, just a quick prick of the needle. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Well, I suppose so. It’s not ideal, but if it will finally put her mind at rest… yes, alright. Just get it over with quickly, please. I don’t particularly enjoy needles, you understand. And try not to poke around too much. I have important things to do, you know. This is rather disruptive to my schedule. Just… be efficient, Doctor. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll be quick and efficient. Great. I'll just need to clean the area on your arm, and then we'll get the sample. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I’m going to do a quick physical exam - listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I told you, I'm perfectly healthy. My wife checks my blood pressure constantly, and it’s always fine. I don’t see the point of poking and prodding, honestly. But… alright, if you insist. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I have a very busy afternoon. I suppose a quick listen won't hurt, but I still think it's rather unnecessary. Just get it over with quickly, Doctor. And try not to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. It’s just a standard part of the check-up, and it helps us get a complete picture of your health. It won't take long at all. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. And then we’ll get that blood sample drawn. First, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath in… and out… Sounds regular. Now, your lungs. Deep breath in… and out… Clear. Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Good. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, for the blood test…
PATIENT: Fine. Good. As I said. Perfectly normal. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing. Just get the blood test done, please. I have things to do. And make sure your assistant doesn't poke around too much with the needle. I dislike needles immensely. Let's just be quick about it, shall we? The sooner this is over, the better. I trust you are proficient at this? I don't want a scene.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable and efficient as possible. I'm going to tie a small tourniquet around your arm to make the veins easier to find. It might feel a little tight. Then I’ll clean the area with an alcohol swab, and you may feel a slight pinch when I insert the needle. Try to relax your arm, and take a deep breath. Okay, here we go… a quick pinch… Alright, all done. Just apply a little pressure to this for a few minutes, and you’ll be all set. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back within a few business days. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Finally. Done. Good. Just… make sure my wife doesn’t get too excited when the results come back. She has a tendency to overreact to things. And please, no unnecessary phone calls. Just let me know when it's all clear. I have important matters to attend to, you understand? I don't have time for dramatics. Honestly, this whole ordeal has been rather disruptive. Just… thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to go home. Is there anything else I need to do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for today. Just keep that bandage on for a few hours, and try to avoid strenuous activity with that arm. And don't hesitate to call if you experience any excessive bleeding or discomfort. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good afternoon, Jacquille. And try not to worry too much.
