DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's this itching. Everywhere, really. It's been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I’d say. Started on my arms, and now it's pretty much all over. Not painful, just… incredibly annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of itching all over, starting on the arms. That is annoying, I can imagine. And you said it’s not painful, just itchy?
PATIENT: That’s right. No pain, no bumps, no redness, really. Just… the itch. It doesn't seem to be getting worse, but it’s not going away either. It's a constant thing, you know? Drives me a bit mad sometimes, especially at night. I keep scratching, but that doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Right, constant itching, not worsening, not improving…and no visible rash or bumps. Hmm. Have you noticed if anything specifically makes it worse, like certain fabrics, soaps, or foods?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I haven’t noticed anything with food, no. I did switch laundry detergents about a month ago… right around the time this started. It’s a new kind, supposed to be for sensitive skin. Maybe that’s it? I’m not sure. I haven’t tried going back to the old one yet, honestly. I figured it said sensitive skin… but maybe I should?
DOCTOR: Okay, a new detergent around the same time it started...that's definitely worth considering. It's easy enough to try switching back and see if it makes a difference. Before we jump to that though, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no fatigue, no changes in my appetite. My energy levels are normal, I think. I sleep okay, despite the itching. Nothing else feels off, just… the itch, like I said. It’s just very… persistent. I feel like I'm going crazy sometimes, just constantly thinking about it! Is it possible to itch from just… stress? My wife… well, she passed away last year, and it’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Brendan. That’s a tremendous loss, and it absolutely can manifest physically. Stress and grief can certainly cause itching, or make existing conditions worse. It’s good you’re mentioning that. Let's explore all the possibilities. Before we fully attribute it to stress, though, let’s do a quick exam, just to rule out anything else. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I’d like to rule things out, for sure. It just… it's hard to believe something like this could come from… nothing. An exam sounds sensible. I appreciate you being thorough.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brendan. It's always best to be thorough. Okay, if you don't mind, I'm going to take a look at your skin. I’ll start with your arms, since that’s where it began, and then we’ll move down. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay… visually, your skin looks clear. No rash, redness, or visible lesions. Palpation doesn't reveal any bumps or unusual textures. I don't feel any areas of swelling or warmth. Your skin feels normal to the touch. It's not particularly dry or oily. Everything seems… normal, actually. Which can sometimes be the most puzzling part.
PATIENT: That’s… odd, isn’t it? It just feels so wrong to be itching all over if everything looks normal. I’m glad you checked, though. So, what does that mean? If it's not a rash, or something visible… what could it be? Could it really just be the stress, or something with the detergent? I mean, is it possible to itch without showing anything?
DOCTOR: It is odd, you're right. It’s not uncommon for itching to be the primary symptom, even without visible skin changes. There are a number of possibilities. Sometimes it can be related to underlying medical conditions like kidney disease, liver problems, or thyroid issues, though those usually present with other symptoms as well. It can also be medication related, or, as you suggested, something like stress or an allergic reaction to something like a new detergent. Since everything looks normal on the exam, and you haven't noticed any other symptoms, I think it’s reasonable to start with the simplest explanations. Let's try switching back to your old laundry detergent for a couple of weeks and see if that makes a difference. If the itching persists, we can consider running some blood tests to check your kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and rule out any other underlying medical causes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan. Switching back to the old detergent is easy enough, and it would be good to get that ruled out. Blood tests… well, I’d rather not, if I don’t have to. But if it’s necessary, I understand. Okay, let's try the detergent first. How long should I give it before I see any change, if there is a change? And what if it doesn’t help at all?
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with the detergent. Give it two weeks, consistently using your old detergent. If you don't see any improvement within that time frame – meaning the itching isn’t lessening at all – then we should schedule a follow-up appointment and discuss the blood tests. It’s always best to rule things out, even if we’re hoping it's something simple. In the meantime, try to keep your skin moisturized, and avoid anything that might irritate it further, like harsh soaps or tight clothing. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if the itching becomes unbearable or if you develop any other symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Two weeks with the old detergent, keep it moisturized, and no irritants. And I’ll call if anything changes or gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening and not immediately jumping to… complicated conclusions. It’s reassuring. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help, and I completely understand wanting to start with the simplest explanations. I'm here if you need anything. Take care of yourself, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. .
