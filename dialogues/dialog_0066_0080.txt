DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you too. I’m just here to get some forms filled out. Medicare sent me a bunch, and I figured it would be easier to do them with someone here to answer any questions I might have.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's a smart idea. Medicare forms can be a bit tricky. We're happy to help get those sorted out. Just sit down, and we can go through them together. Do you have them with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. There’s… quite a few of them, as you can see. I wasn’t sure where to even start, honestly.
DOCTOR: You're not alone, a lot of patients feel that way. Don’t worry, we'll tackle them one by one. Let’s start with this one here…it looks like a general health information form. We’ll just go through your basic details – name, date of birth, insurance information – and then we can move on to your medical history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. My name is Thyra Fabing, and my birthday is…let me think… November 12th, 1989. And I already told the lady at the front desk about my Medicare, but I can confirm the number if that helps.
DOCTOR: November 12th, 1989. Perfect. And yes, please confirm your Medicare number just to be double-sure. No problem at all. Just take your time. We want to get everything accurate. Also, could you tell me your height and weight if you happen to know it offhand?
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… it’s… 1B4-567-8901. And for my height and weight… I’m about 5’7” and… around 155 pounds. It changes a little, you know?
DOCTOR: 1B4-567-8901, 5’7”, and 155 pounds. Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. A little fluctuation is perfectly normal. Alright, the next section is about your past medical history. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really major illnesses, no. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once… when I was about ten. Other than that… nothing much. A lot of colds, you know, the usual stuff. I’ve never been seriously sick, thankfully. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm around age ten. Good to know. That doesn’t sound like anything that would be a major concern right now. No serious illnesses, that's excellent. Let's talk about family history then. Are there any health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that your parents or grandparents had?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a little complicated. My mom's side… my grandmother had diabetes, and I think my uncle has heart problems now. My dad's side… honestly, I didn’t know my dad very well. We weren’t close. So, I don’t know much about their health history. I wish I knew more, but it’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families to not have complete medical histories. Knowing about your grandmother’s diabetes and your uncle’s heart problems is helpful. And it’s understandable that you don’t have much information about your father’s side. We can work with what you do know. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean exactly? Like… what I do for fun?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. It's not about what you do for fun specifically, although you can mention that if you'd like! It's more about things like your lifestyle—do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, that makes more sense. No, I don’t smoke. I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. I work a lot, mostly. Being a control valve installer keeps me pretty busy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No smoking, occasional glass of wine, and working as a control valve installer. Sounds like you stay active. One more quick thing before we move onto medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, usually. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, when it's acting up from work. That’s it, really. Nothing regular, except the multivitamin. Oh! And sometimes I use some Bengay on my back too. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed for back pain, and Bengay. Yes, that counts – it’s good to know everything you’re using. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. I get bitten by mosquitoes like everyone else, but that’s about it. We have a lot of mosquitoes where I live!
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That completes the initial paperwork. Now, before we finalize everything, I'd like to quickly check your vital signs - blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. Nurse will get started now. Blood pressure is 128/82. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Respiration is 16, unlabored. Now, are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back is a little sore, like usual after a long day at work, but it’s nothing major. It’s just… a dull ache. I’m used to it. Nothing to worry about right now, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your lower back, consistent with your occupation. That’s good to know. Now, just to cover all bases, could you quickly go through a brief review of systems for me?
PATIENT: Review of systems? What does that involve? Is that like… checking if anything’s broken?
DOCTOR: No, nothing like checking if anything's broken! It's just a series of questions about different parts of your body to see if you've been experiencing any changes or symptoms we haven’t discussed yet. For example, have you noticed any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my weight has been pretty stable, I think. Maybe I gained a pound or two over the winter, but nothing dramatic. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. What else do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Any changes in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Nope. I sleep pretty well, actually. I usually get about seven or eight hours a night. Sometimes I wake up a little stiff from work, but nothing that a hot shower can’t fix. I'm usually pretty tired by the end of the day, so I fall asleep pretty easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My stomach has been fine. Everything’s been… regular, you could say. I haven't had any problems there. What about… anything to do with my heart? Because my uncle has had a few issues, you know? Should I be worried about that?
DOCTOR: That's a good question and it’s good you brought that up, given your uncle's history. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I haven't had any chest pain, and I can breathe just fine. My ankles aren't swollen either. I just… worry sometimes, you know? With my uncle being sick. It makes me a little nervous, even when I feel fine. But honestly, I feel pretty healthy overall. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, and it's smart to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart issues. No chest pain, shortness of breath or swelling, that’s very good. Any recent headaches, vision changes or dizziness?
PATIENT: No headaches, no vision changes and no dizziness. My eyesight is still pretty good, I think. I wear glasses, but that’s just for reading. Everything feels pretty normal there. What’s next?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Any pain or swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Nope. My joints feel okay, a little creaky sometimes when it's cold, but that's just old age, I guess! Nothing major, no pain or swelling, honestly. It's more just… stiffness. You know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Any changes in your urination or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Nope. Everything’s pretty normal there, too. No changes at all. Honestly, I’m starting to think I’m a pretty healthy person! Is that a bad thing?
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very good thing! It sounds like you're in overall good health, which is excellent. We've covered a lot here. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I guess. You’ve asked me everything I can think of! Maybe just… what’s the next step? Do I need to come back for any tests or anything? I just wanted to get these forms filled out, like I said. I appreciate you taking the time to go through everything with me. It’s been really helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome! Based on everything we've discussed, I don’t think any further testing is needed at this time. We’ve completed all necessary information for these forms, and I’ll review and sign them for Medicare. Just keep an eye on your back pain; if it worsens or you experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. I will have the nurse review everything with you before you leave. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, thank you! I really appreciate it, Dr. Condray. You’ve been very helpful and kind. It's good to know everything’s alright, and I’m just here to get things done, not because I'm sick. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Thyra. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, proactive care is the best care. And if anything changes, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day!
