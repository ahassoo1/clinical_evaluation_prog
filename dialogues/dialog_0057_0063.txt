DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it's been really bad. Hurts a lot. It's not new, you know? I had cancer before, and it's... it's the same kind of pain, but worse now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain, and it's concerning because it's similar to pain you experienced with a previous cancer diagnosis. That’s definitely something we need to explore carefully. Just to clarify, when you say “the same kind of pain,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Um… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like a quick sharp pain. It’s more… deep. Like a heavy ache, all the way down my back. And it makes it hard to move, you know? Especially bending over. It feels like something is… stuck. And sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Not always, but when it does, it makes my foot feel funny. I don't know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Meigs. A deep, heavy ache that radiates down your back and sometimes into your leg, with some numbness or a “funny” feeling in your foot… that gives me a better picture. When did this pain start, or when did you notice it getting worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, I think, maybe a month ago. But it was just a little ache then. I thought it was from working too hard at the factory, you know, bending boxes all day. But then, maybe two weeks ago, it got really bad. Like I said, it’s been getting worse every day since then. I tried to ignore it, but now it’s hard to even sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started mild about a month ago, worsening significantly over the past two weeks, now interfering with your sleep. And you work at a factory, doing a lot of bending. That's helpful information. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Well, like I said, I had cancer before. It was… it was in my chest, a long time ago. Maybe ten years ago? I had… treatments, and they said it was gone. I went to check-ups for a while, but then… I moved here, and it was hard to find a doctor I liked, so I stopped going as often. And I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take pills for that. Other than that… not much, I think. I get tired easy, but that’s probably just from working.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Meigs. That’s important to know. Cancer in the chest ten years ago, now in remission, high blood pressure managed with medication, and you experience some fatigue. Can you tell me what medication you're currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it here. It’s… Lisinopril. 20 milligrams. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if my back gets really bad, I take… Tylenol. Just when I can’t stand it anymore. But that doesn’t really help much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for high blood pressure and Tylenol as needed for your back pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… never had a reaction. I don’t have allergies. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And just to complete the picture, can you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hm. That’s a hard one. My family… it’s complicated. My mother had… heart trouble, I think. And my brother has diabetes. But other than that… I don’t really know much about what other people had. We didn’t talk about it much, you know? It was a long time ago, and we didn't see each other much. I'm not sure if that helps?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Meigs. Knowing your mother had heart trouble and your brother has diabetes is helpful. We don’t always have complete family histories, and that’s okay. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. I don’t do any of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol. Not even a little bit. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I try to stay healthy, you know? It’s just… hard with the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a physical exam of your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and how to make the pain stop. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could please lie down on the table, face up, that would be wonderful. I’ll start by feeling your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Then, I’ll ask you to move in a few different directions to see how your range of motion is. I’ll also check your reflexes and sensation in your legs. It won’t be painful, but please let me know if anything causes you discomfort. Okay, Ms. Meigs, can you tell me where exactly the pain is most intense?
PATIENT: Right… right here. It hurts all over, but it’s worst on this side. And it feels… deep. Like it’s inside my bones, almost. And when I bend over… ooh, that’s when it really hurts. It feels like something is pulling. Does that make sense? It's not just on my skin, you know? It's inside.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Lower back pain, predominantly on the left side, described as deep and internal, worsening with bending. Alright, can you bend forward and touch your toes, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… that’s hard. I can’t get all the way. It hurts too much. That pulls really bad. It feels like something is stuck. And it’s getting worse now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, that’s good to know. Limited range of motion, pain with forward flexion. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. This is just to see how your nerves are functioning. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes seem normal on both sides. Now, let's check sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel me touching your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. I can feel it. Both legs… feel the same. Not numb, not tingling. Just… normal. I don't know if that makes sense? But I can feel you touching me, everywhere. It’s not like my foot is asleep or anything. It's just… sore, from working.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Sensation is intact in both legs. Okay, Ms. Meigs, thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you’re experiencing lower back pain, likely a muscle strain or sprain, possibly aggravated by your work. However, given your history of cancer, we need to be cautious. It’s important to rule out any recurrence or spread. To do that, I'd like to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back, and possibly an MRI, to get a clearer picture of your spine and surrounding tissues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. If you think it’s important, yes. I want to know what’s going on. I just… I worry it’s the cancer again. So if the pictures will show us, yes. Please. Whatever you think is best. But I want to know. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. That's a perfectly reasonable concern, and we're going to investigate it thoroughly. The imaging will help us determine the cause of your pain and guide the best course of treatment. I’ll also order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential causes. The lab and imaging orders are submitted. The lab should be able to draw blood today, and we can schedule the X-ray and MRI as soon as possible. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule those appointments. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug to help manage your pain and inflammation. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. Here is the prescription. I also recommend gentle stretching and avoiding any strenuous activity until we have the results of the imaging. If your pain worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, weakness, or numbness, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… gentle stretching. And no heavy lifting. I can do that. And I'll take the pills, like you said. Um… what if… what if it is the cancer? What happens then? I don't want to go through all that again. It was… hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Meigs. If the imaging reveals any signs of recurrence, we'll discuss all of your treatment options with you in detail. This could include things like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery, depending on the extent and location of the cancer. We would also connect you with an oncologist who specializes in your type of cancer and a support team to help you navigate the emotional and practical challenges of treatment. It’s important to remember that treatment options have advanced significantly over the past ten years. We have more tools available now than ever before. We’ll work with you every step of the way to develop a plan that’s right for you. But let’s not jump to conclusions yet. We’re going to get these tests done and see what they show. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, our focus is on figuring out the cause of your pain and getting you feeling better. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please let me know when the pictures are ready. I need to know. And thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not making me feel like I’m crazy. I’ll go home now. And try to rest. And no heavy lifting. You said that, right?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. And you're not crazy at all. It’s perfectly understandable to be concerned, especially given your history. We're here to support you. Yes, no heavy lifting. Our office will contact you as soon as the imaging results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Get some rest, and take care of yourself. .
