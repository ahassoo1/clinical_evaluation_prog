DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my breathing. I have trouble when I lie down flat. It feels like… like something is pressing on me. I don’t like it one bit. I’d like to get this sorted if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. Trouble breathing, especially when lying down, is certainly something we want to investigate. Can you tell me more about this feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a cough, and it’s not like I can’t breathe, exactly. It’s more… a heaviness. And I have to use more effort. I usually just prop myself up with extra pillows, and that helps. It’s been going on for… oh, I’d say about three months now, maybe a little longer. It’s slowly gotten worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heaviness that requires more effort, relieved somewhat by propping yourself up with pillows, and it’s been developing over about three months. That’s helpful information. Does this happen at any other time, or is it primarily when you're lying down?
PATIENT: Mostly when I lie down, yes. Sometimes if I bend over to pick something up, I feel a little short of breath then too, but not usually. It’s much worse when I’m trying to sleep. I used to sleep on my back, but I can't do that anymore. I have to sleep on my side now, with a lot of pillows. It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sleeping comfortably is important. And it's good you've found a way to manage it somewhat with the pillows. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling? Let me think… yes, actually. My ankles have been a little puffy, now that you mention it. Not terribly bad, but noticeable. I thought it was just from the heat, honestly. We’ve had some very warm weather lately. I didn’t think much of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy ankles along with the shortness of breath and difficulty lying flat. That’s good information to have. And you said this has been gradually worsening over the past three months. Have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No chest pain, no. And my heart doesn't race or anything. I get a little… lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too quickly, but I’ve always been a bit prone to that. It’s not new. It’s just… the breathing is the new thing, and it worries me. It feels different than just being out of shape.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chest pain, no palpitations, and a history of occasional lightheadedness when standing. You're right to be concerned about the breathing, especially since it feels different. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was no trouble. And I have… arthritis, in my hands mostly. It doesn’t bother me too much, just a little stiffness in the mornings. Oh, and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. I take a little pill every day. I believe that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past, arthritis, and well-controlled high blood pressure. That’s helpful. And what medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s a small white pill. Oh dear, I'm terrible with names. I think it starts with an 'A'. Lisinopril, is that it? Yes, I believe that’s right. Lisinopril. And I take one every morning with my breakfast. I haven’t changed the dose in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, one pill daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medicine they’ve given me before. I used to be worried about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in ages. I don’t spend much time outdoors these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, just to finish up with your history, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… well, my mother had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired, and she died when she was fairly young, I suppose. And my father had… diabetes. He lost a leg because of it. And my brother… he had high blood pressure too, like me. But that’s about all I remember, honestly. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems, diabetes, and high blood pressure. That's important to know. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and look at your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. The sooner we figure this out, the better. Please, go ahead. I’d like to get to the bottom of this breathing problem. It's just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. It’s not terribly concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound a little… diminished at the bases. A little bit of crackling as well, on both sides. Blood pressure is 140/90 today. A bit elevated. And now let’s take a look at your ankles. Yes, there’s some mild swelling, as you mentioned. And some slight pitting when I press. Alright. Now, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Also, I’d like to check a blood test, including a complete blood count, kidney function, and something called a BNP, which helps us assess your heart function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Yes, please do all of that. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’d like to know what’s going on, and if those tests will help, then let’s do them. When can I expect the results? And where will I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll get those ordered right away. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic, the technician will come up and take it in just a moment. The blood test will just require a quick draw, and we’ll send that off to the lab. As for the results, the X-ray should be back within the hour, and the lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours. We’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m suspecting this could be related to congestive heart failure, given your symptoms, the crackling in your lungs, the swelling in your ankles, and the elevated blood pressure. But we need those tests to confirm. To start, let’s keep you on a low-sodium diet. And I’m going to prescribe a diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce some of the fluid. It's called Furosemide, 20 milligrams once a day in the morning. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds serious. A water pill, you say? Furosemide? Will that… will that make me have to go to the bathroom a lot? And is there anything else I should be doing? I’ve always tried to take care of myself, but… this is worrying.
DOCTOR: Yes, Furosemide is a water pill, and it will likely make you urinate more frequently. It’s important to stay well-hydrated while taking it, but you may want to plan bathroom breaks throughout the day. It’s also important to monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain, especially a few pounds in a day or two, please call us immediately. Congestive heart failure sounds scary, and it is a serious condition, but it's also very manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. We caught this early, and that’s important. We will closely monitor your symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed. For now, let’s focus on the low-sodium diet, taking the Furosemide as prescribed, and monitoring your weight. Also, try to avoid strenuous activity until we get the test results back. Do you have any questions about the diet?
PATIENT: No, I think I can manage the diet. No salt, right? I can do that. The weight… I have a scale. I can check that every day. And if I start feeling worse… if the breathing gets worse, or… or something else happens, I should call? Right away? Even if it's late at night?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Yes, if your breathing worsens, if you experience any chest pain, dizziness, or severe swelling, please call immediately. Don't hesitate. Even if it's late at night. Our answering service will connect you to the on-call physician. We want to be proactive. The nurse will go over the medication instructions and diet with you again before you leave. And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the test results and see how you're doing. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and… I feel a little better knowing there’s a plan. I’ll… I’ll watch my weight and take the pills and try not to worry too much. I suppose I should wait for the nurse then? .
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s all we ask. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to help. And please remember, we caught this early, and we're going to work through this together. Have a good day, Ms. Vanderwiele.
