DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Espinueva, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Clearance Espinueva. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. Though frankly, I have a great many patients. Now, to be efficient, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my side, mostly. I get a pain in my flank, you see. And… and I keep getting water infections. The doctor back home – Fiji, that is – he said it’s something to do with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. It's been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Polycystic… right. And how long has this “on and off” been going on for, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's been… at least five years, I’d say. Maybe longer. It's hard to keep track when you’re getting on in years, you know? The infections come and go, and the pain… well, the pain flares up when I drink too much, I think. Or when I get a bit… dehydrated.
DOCTOR: Dehydrated. And how much fluid are you typically consuming in a day, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I try to drink water, of course. But… I don’t know, maybe six or seven glasses? It depends. I enjoy a cup of tea with my meals, and sometimes a little juice. I don't push myself to drink too much, if that makes sense. I don't want to be running to the bathroom all day!
DOCTOR: Six to seven glasses… Adequate, but not optimal. And these infections… are you currently having an infection, or are you simply recalling past occurrences?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. I finished the antibiotics about a week ago, I think. It was a bad one this time, a lot of burning. But the doctor prescribed something, and it cleared it up. I just… I worry they keep coming back, you see. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any other symptoms alongside these infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, just generally run down. And my back aches a bit, even when the infection isn't bothering me. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And sometimes, when I go to the toilet, I notice a little bit of… blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It's mostly with the infections, I think.
DOCTOR: Blood in the urine… and fatigue. Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nausea or vomiting. My appetite is… okay. A little smaller than it used to be, perhaps. But I still enjoy my food. I like a good meal, you know? I just don't eat as much of it as I used to. It's just… getting older, I suppose. Things slow down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, and check your back for tenderness. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It might take me a moment, my knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Espinueva. No rush. Now, if you could just lie flat on your back, please. I'm going to palpate your abdomen first. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am. Just let me know if you need me to move. And yes, please be gentle. My ribs are a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just checking for any masses or tenderness… There's some mild tenderness in your left flank, as you mentioned. Not acutely painful, but definitely present. I don't feel any obvious masses. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Bowel sounds are present, normal.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… alright, I suppose. It’s good to know nothing’s obviously wrong. Is that a good sign, Doctor? I do worry sometimes. My mother… she had kidney trouble too, you see. It was a long time ago, but…
DOCTOR: It’s something. We need to investigate further. Now, I'd like to check your back. Please turn onto your side, facing away from me. I’m going to gently palpate your spine and the surrounding muscles. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a bit awkward. My back isn't as flexible as it used to be, you see. Alright, go ahead. Just be careful, please. I pulled a muscle there a few years ago… it still bothers me sometimes.
DOCTOR: There is some muscle tenderness along your spine, particularly on the left side. No obvious signs of acute injury. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam. Now, I'm going to order some blood work and a urine analysis. We need to check your kidney function and rule out any ongoing infection.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and… a urine analysis. Will that tell us what’s going on? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a friend visiting next week, and I’d like to know if I’ll be able to enjoy her company.
DOCTOR: The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. It will give us a clearer picture of your kidney function and whether there's an active infection. Given your history of recurrent infections and the tenderness I felt, I’m also going to order an ultrasound of your kidneys. That will allow us to visualize their structure and look for any abnormalities. I suspect, based on what you've told me, that this may be related to your polycystic kidney disease. We need to confirm it. Don’t make any plans based on the results until after we’ve reviewed them together. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly understood, Doctor. No plans until we know more. Ultrasound… that sounds… thorough. Polycystic kidney disease… it’s just… a bit worrying, isn’t it? My doctor back home mentioned it, but didn't go into much detail. Is it… serious? I hope it's not something too bad.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Mr. Espinueva, but it's also manageable. Many people live long and productive lives with polycystic kidney disease. The key is early detection and proper management. We need to monitor your kidney function regularly and address any complications that may arise. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results of the blood work and ultrasound. In the meantime, increase your fluid intake, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and contact the clinic immediately if you develop any fever, flank pain, or changes in your urination. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate it. One week… I’ll try to stay positive until then. I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You haven't. The nurse will escort you to schedule your follow-up appointment. And remember, increase your fluid intake. .
