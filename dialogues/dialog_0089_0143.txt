DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I'm Dr. Roseburroagh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. I think it's about... starting a family? My... friend and I, we are thinking about it. But I'm... old. And I want to make sure everything is okay, you know? Before we... try. I don’t really remember what the young people say these days. Is this the right place for that kind of thing?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Verrall. This is a perfectly appropriate reason to come see me. Family planning and preconception health are definitely within my scope of practice. It’s excellent that you’re thinking ahead and wanting to ensure everything is as healthy as possible. “Old” is relative, and we can certainly assess your overall health to see if there are any concerns. To start, could you tell me a little more about your friend?
PATIENT: My friend… her name is Lila. She’s… much younger than me. A good person. Very kind. We haven’t… been together long. It’s… new. I don’t want to mess things up, you see? I'm not sure she's thought about… all of this. Like, if I’m healthy enough. Or if… well, if it’s even possible. I hope that makes sense. It’s all a bit… blurry, to be honest. I just want to be responsible.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verrall. It’s very thoughtful of you to be considering these things, and it’s completely normal to feel a little unsure when starting something new. We'll take things one step at a time. Let's start with your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. Not… really. I travel a lot for work, you see. Sales. Engineering things. It’s hard to keep a doctor when you’re always on the road. I probably haven't seen one properly in… oh, a long time. Maybe five years? Longer? I had a check-up then, I think. For… something. I can’t quite recall what it was for. Is that… bad? I do remember a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist. But that's about it. I try to stay healthy. I walk a lot, and I try to eat okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. It’s alright if you haven’t seen a doctor regularly; we can certainly catch things up. The fall and broken wrist is good information to have. Do you remember approximately when that happened?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The fall… it was… around 2020, I believe. Maybe 2021? It was during a trip to… Germany, I think. Yes, Germany. I was showing some equipment to a client. Slippery floor. Nasty break. They put a cast on it. Took a long time to heal. I remember the pain… definitely remember the pain. And the physiotherapy. It was… unpleasant. Does that help? I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Verrall. 2020 or 2021 is good enough. Now, besides the broken wrist, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something like that once, a long time ago. But he said it was just a little high and to watch my salt intake. I try to watch my salt intake. Mostly. Diabetes… no, I don't think so. Heart problems… no. I feel okay, mostly. Sometimes a little tired. But that’s probably just the travel. And the age, you know? I'm not as young as I used to be. I don’t take any regular medication, if that helps. Nothing at all. Except… sometimes a painkiller for my back. It gets stiff from all the walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possible history of slightly elevated blood pressure, no known diabetes or heart problems, occasional painkiller for back stiffness, no regular medications otherwise. That's good information. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that has affected your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My… my parents are both gone now. And I don’t have any siblings. I was an only child. My father… he had some sort of breathing problem when he was older. But I don’t know what it was. Emphysema, maybe? He smoked a lot. My mother… she was healthy, I think. Always very active. She died… suddenly, from a heart attack. But she was quite old. I don’t really know much about any other health problems in the family. We weren’t… very close. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. My memory is failing me again. It’s frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. You've given me a good amount of information already, and it’s not always easy to recall family history. Knowing about your mother's heart attack and your father’s breathing problem is helpful. To get a better understanding of your current health, and to make sure everything is okay, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A physical exam… good. Yes, that sounds sensible. I want to make sure I’m… up to this. For Lila, you know? And for… well, for starting a family. I just… hope everything isn’t too bad. I haven’t had one of those in a long time. What exactly will you be doing? I get a little… nervous, sometimes. Especially about needles.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose and throat. I'll do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. And yes, we will need to draw some blood for lab tests – it's standard procedure, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll make a note about your needle aversion. Is there anything else that makes you particularly uncomfortable or anxious about the exam?
PATIENT: The blood… yes, that’s the worst. I get very lightheaded, sometimes. And I bruise easily. I’m not a fan of needles at all. And… well, my back. It’s been bothering me lately. Especially when I bend over. I try not to think about it, but it’s always there, a dull ache. And… please be gentle. I’m an old man, you know? My skin is… delicate. Is it okay if I lie down for the blood draw? That might help. I just… I don’t want to faint. Or make a mess. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Not a bother at all, Mr. Verrall. I appreciate you telling me everything, it helps me provide the best possible care. And absolutely, you can lie down for the blood draw – that’s a very good idea. I’ll take my time and be as gentle as possible. We can also use a smaller needle if that would make you more comfortable. I’ll make a note about the back pain, and we can discuss it further after the exam. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Blood pressure first. That sounds… manageable. I hope it’s not too high. I had a cup of coffee this morning. Does coffee affect it? I shouldn’t have had the coffee, should I? Oh dear. This is all my fault. I’m always making things more complicated than they need to be.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Verrall. A little coffee won’t drastically affect it, but it's good to be aware of things like that. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. It's within a range we can monitor and discuss. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and another one… and exhale. Good. Do you have any history of asthma or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: No, no asthma. Or bronchitis. Never had either. I used to smoke, a long time ago. When I was younger. But I quit, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Best thing I ever did. My father… he had a smoker’s cough, towards the end. A nasty sound. I didn’t want to end up like him. Is my breathing okay? It feels a little… wheezy, maybe? Perhaps it’s just my nerves. I hope I’m not getting a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do hear a little wheezing, which could be related to your previous smoking history. It's not alarming at this point, but something we should keep an eye on. And yes, it could certainly be related to nerves as well. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Please try to relax. Your heart sounds regular, but I'll note that I hear a slight murmur. It's a soft murmur, and likely benign, but we will order an EKG to get a clearer picture. Now, let's check your ears, nose and throat. Please open your mouth and say “Ah…”
PATIENT: “Ah…” My throat feels a little dry. I haven’t been drinking enough water, probably. I always forget. Is it bad to forget things like that? My ears are fine, I think. No ringing or anything. I had a bit of an ear infection when I was a child, but it cleared up quickly. And my nose… well, it’s just a nose. Nothing special about it. I hope you’re not finding anything wrong. This is all a bit worrying, to be honest. I just want to be sure everything is okay for… for everything.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good in your ears and throat. You're right, your throat does seem a little dry. And it’s perfectly normal to forget things sometimes, Mr. Verrall. I’m not finding anything alarming at this point, but we’ll need some lab work and an EKG to get a more complete picture. Now, let’s talk about the blood draw. We’ll start with a standard panel to check your overall health – things like your blood count, cholesterol, and blood sugar. We’ll also check your kidney and liver function. Is there anything else you’d like me to check?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t know. What should I ask for? Lila… she said something about… checking for things you can pass on? Like… inherited problems? Is that something you do? I don’t want to worry her, but it’s probably important, isn’t it? And… maybe check my vitamin levels? I’ve been feeling tired lately, and I heard that can be a sign of something. Oh, and… check for… you know… everything. Just to be safe. I don’t want any surprises. I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Mr. Verrall. Yes, we can definitely check for inherited conditions – a genetic screening panel. And checking your vitamin levels is a good idea, especially with your fatigue. We’ll also include a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall organ function. A "comprehensive" panel is what we are doing. To clarify, are you specifically concerned about any particular inherited conditions that run in your family, or would you prefer a broad screening panel?
PATIENT: No, not specifically. I don’t know of any, really. My family wasn’t very… open about things like that. But Lila… she said it’s better to be safe than sorry. She’s very sensible. So… a broad screening panel, please. Everything you can check. I just want to be prepared. And… if there’s anything I should be worried about, I want to know. Even if it’s… bad news. I’m an old man, Doctor. I can handle it. I just want to be sure everything is okay for… for the future.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. A broad genetic screening panel it is. And we’ll run a comprehensive metabolic panel as well, including vitamin levels. That's a very sensible approach. Okay, let's get started with the blood draw. We’ll need to draw about two vials of blood. I'll have the nurse prepare everything and I’ll be right back. Remember, you can lie down if you’re feeling lightheaded. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you’re feeling unwell at any time.
