DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about this…certification, you see. It's required for my…work. Honestly, the paperwork is quite a bother. I believe it has to do with ensuring my…senses are adequate. Something about hearing and…seeing, naturally. It's all rather vague, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: Right. A certification… for work. And it involves a sensory assessment, hearing and vision, you said?
PATIENT: Precisely. It's…healthcare, you understand. One must be able to, well, perceive things accurately. Though, frankly, I’ve been doing this for quite some time now, and I’ve never had any…complaints. It feels rather…redundant. Is this going to take long? I have a rather full schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand the inconvenience. While your experience is valuable, these certifications are often mandated for legal and safety reasons. It is important to ensure everything is up to standard. To start, let's just get a basic medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… illnesses? Hmm. That's a rather broad question, isn’t it? I’ve had the usual…colds, of course. A touch of the flu now and then. As for surgeries… I believe I had my tonsils removed when I was a boy, but that was…a very long time ago. Honestly, I don’t recall anything particularly significant. Is a bad back considered significant? I occasionally…ache. It's probably just age, you understand.
DOCTOR: "Occasionally ache" is still useful information, Mr. Oriley. And yes, back problems can be significant. Do you recall when you had your tonsils removed, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Oh dear. That would have been…well, when I was a child, naturally. In Norway, you see. Before…well, before a great many things changed. Perhaps the…sixties? Though, my memory isn’t what it once was. It was…a hospital. A perfectly adequate hospital, I believe. They gave me…something to sleep. Is this truly relevant, Doctor? It seems a rather…distant memory.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Mr. Oriley. Any surgical history needs to be documented. We need to ascertain if there were any complications. Do you recall if you had any issues after the tonsillectomy?
PATIENT: Complications? Heavens, no. I don’t believe so. I recovered perfectly well, as far as I recall. A bit sore, naturally, but that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I had a great deal of…lemonade, I remember that distinctly. And my mother fussed over me, quite a bit. Honestly, I find it rather…irritating that we’re dwelling on this. It was a simple childhood procedure, decades ago. Are we getting closer to the actual reason I’m here, Doctor? This certification, you understand.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Mr. Oriley. It's simply good practice to have a complete medical history before proceeding with any assessment. Let’s move on. Do you have any family history of hearing or vision problems?
PATIENT: Hearing or vision… Hmm. My father… he was rather hard of hearing in his later years, I suppose. Though, that was to be expected, wasn't it? He spent a great deal of time on the sea. A rather rugged life, you see. As for vision, my mother always wore glasses. Rather thick ones, if I recall correctly. But that was… purely cosmetic, I believe. She was rather vain, you understand. Is this going to be a long list, Doctor? I have appointments, you see. Important appointments.
DOCTOR: "Rugged life" and "thick glasses" aren’t particularly helpful, Mr. Oriley. Did either of your parents have any diagnosed hearing loss or vision impairment?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Goodness, I wouldn’t know. This was… decades ago, you see. Back when things weren't so…precise. They probably just…complained a bit. My father mumbled quite a bit, if I recall correctly, and my mother squinted. I doubt they bothered with doctors. They were a practical sort, you understand. More concerned with…fishing and such. Honestly, I'm beginning to suspect this certification is rather… unnecessary. Is there no way to simply… bypass this whole process? Perhaps a waiver?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mr. Oriley, a waiver is unlikely. Now, let's talk about you. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, blurred vision, difficulty hearing conversations, or any other sensory issues?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that you mention it, occasionally. A very faint ringing. Barely noticeable, really. I assumed it was just… the silence. I spend a great deal of time in quiet contemplation, you understand. Blurred vision? No, not really. Everything seems… adequately clear. Though, my reading glasses are getting rather…scratched. Difficulty hearing? Sometimes people mumble. It’s usually their fault, not mine. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather…personal, Doctor. Are you implying something?
DOCTOR: I'm simply attempting to gather a complete medical history, Mr. Oriley. Now, regarding these occasional issues – the ringing, the slightly blurry vision, the difficulty hearing – have you noticed these getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Worse…hmm. That’s a difficult question. Time, you understand, tends to…blur things. I suppose the ringing might be…slightly more frequent. And yes, I suppose I have to hold things a little further away when reading. Though, that could simply be…fatigue. It’s a tiring world, you see. I find myself needing more light, perhaps. Honestly, I suspect it's all perfectly normal for someone of my…age. Is this going to involve some sort of…test? A complicated test? I really must stress, I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Oriley, it will involve a hearing and vision test. Standard procedures. I've scheduled you for those now. The audiologist is Nurse Davies; she'll be with you shortly. And I would appreciate it if you could provide straightforward answers to her questions, please. It will save us both a great deal of time.
PATIENT: Straightforward answers, naturally. I always endeavor to be…precise. Though, as I’ve mentioned, my memory isn’t what it once was. But I shall do my best. Nurse Davies, you say? A perfectly adequate nurse, I trust? And these tests…will they be… unpleasant? I’m not particularly fond of…prodding and poking. Though, I suppose it’s necessary for this…certification. A rather bothersome requirement, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies is perfectly capable, Mr. Oriley. And the tests are non-invasive. She will explain everything. Please follow me. And please try to refrain from lengthy explanations about your memory to the nurse. She has other patients to attend to.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to be…concise. Though, I do believe a little context is often…helpful. But I understand your concern. Lead the way, then. Though, I must confess, I find this whole process rather…demeaning. A perfectly capable healthcare professional, being subjected to such… scrutiny. I do hope Nurse Davies has a comfortable chair.
DOCTOR:
