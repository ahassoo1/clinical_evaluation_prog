DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, good morning to you. Andraca, you say? Sounds…foreign. My niece booked this appointment. Said I had to come. Something about not wanting…what was it…“procedures”? Honestly, I don’t even know what’s going on. I just want to be left alone, really. I’ve been a podiatrist for fifty years, I think it was, and I know my own feet just fine.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It sounds like you're a bit frustrated, and perhaps feeling like your concerns aren’t being fully acknowledged. I apologize if the appointment was booked without a clear explanation. And you are right to be an expert on your body – fifty years as a podiatrist is incredibly valuable experience. I assure you, I'm here to listen and help in any way I can. We can definitely discuss what's going on and what you want. Perhaps your niece is concerned about something specific?
PATIENT: Concerned is a…strong word. She worries, that girl. Always has. Thinks I’m falling apart just because I'm…seasoned. She saw something on the television, I believe. About…tests? And poking and prodding. Said I needed to get checked for…diabetes, was it? Though I’ve always been healthy as a horse. Never needed much from doctors, frankly. They just want to sell you things.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Wynell. It's perfectly reasonable to be cautious about medical interventions, especially when you've lived a healthy life and haven't needed much care in the past. And it's good that your niece is looking out for you. Testing for diabetes is a common recommendation, especially as we get older, even for those who feel healthy. It can sometimes develop without obvious symptoms. It sounds like she's concerned about your feet, perhaps?
PATIENT: Feet are fine. They ache a bit, what feet don’t ache at my age? And they look…normal, I suppose. A little dry, maybe. I used to have a lovely foot cream, sandalwood and something else…can’t recall now. But I wouldn’t say they’re…a problem. All this fuss over nothing, I tell you. Honestly, it’s a waste of my time. And yours, I presume.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me that, Wynell. Even if it's just a bit of aching, it's good to understand what's going on. Sometimes, even small changes can indicate something we should address. And you’re right, your time is valuable. To get a better sense of things, would you mind if I just took a quick look at your feet and asked you a few questions about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. But don’t go poking around too much. And don’t expect me to tell you my life story. I’ve had enough of doctors in my time. Just…look quickly, ask quickly, and let me go home.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Wynell. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I notice a little dryness, as you mentioned, and your skin seems a bit thin. I don’t feel any significant tenderness at the moment. Do you experience any pain when you’re walking or standing for long periods?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Not sharp pain, mind you. More of a…nagging ache. Especially towards the end of the day. And if I wear the wrong shoes. Those newfangled styles are dreadful. Give me a sensible pump any day. But it’s nothing I haven’t dealt with for years. It’s just…old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful to know that it's a nagging ache and related to footwear. It could be related to age, as you said, but it’s also good to rule out other possibilities. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, lord. Do I have to? Honestly, I haven’t been to a proper doctor in…well, I don’t even remember. I eat reasonably, I think. Mostly fish and vegetables. And I used to walk every day, before my knees started acting up. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a while back, but it’s been…stable, I guess. My niece handles all that paperwork, you see. Medicare and all.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. It sounds like you’ve generally taken good care of yourself. And it’s good to know about the blood pressure. Knowing you've had some monitoring is helpful. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see…There was a little white pill. I think. My niece keeps it in a plastic container, with all sorts of other things. I just take what she gives me, really. I don’t bother with remembering names. Too much fuss. She tells me when it’s time, and I swallow it. Honestly, all this questioning is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. It can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. That’s why I’m going to take a look at your medical records to see what medications you’ve been prescribed. While I do that, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. I’ve always had a strong stomach. Although…once, years ago, I had a reaction to some sort of shellfish. But that was a long time ago. It was just a little rash, nothing serious. I don't recall the specifics. Everything gives me a bit of a tummy ache, if I eat too much of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now, let me just quickly check your records here… Okay, it looks like you are on a medication for high blood pressure – Lisinopril, 20mg daily. And it lists a remote allergy to shrimp, with a note of "mild rash." It also shows a history of well-controlled hypertension. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family had diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmmmph. Let me think. My mother…she was a bit frail towards the end. Had trouble with her feet, I remember that. But I don't recall anyone being diagnosed with diabetes. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my siblings…well, they weren’t much for talking about their health, even when they were alive. It's all a bit of a blur, really. I've got a terrible memory, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Wynell. It's common for family history to be a bit unclear. Now, just to finish up, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I sit. I read. I watch television. I used to garden, before my knees started acting up. I don't smoke. Never have. And I drink a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. A nice Chardonnay. Is that what you mean by "lifestyle"? It sounds awfully complicated.
DOCTOR: Yes, Wynell, that’s exactly what I mean by lifestyle! It sounds like you enjoy a relaxing life. Okay, I think I have a good understanding of your overall health now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination I’ve done, it sounds like you are experiencing some mild peripheral neuropathy, likely related to age and possibly some early effects of diabetes. The aching in your feet, the dryness of your skin, and the remote history of potential shellfish allergy all fit. However, to confirm this, I would like to order a simple blood test to check your blood sugar levels and rule out other possible causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests?! I knew it. It always comes down to blood tests. And you're saying…what was that word?…neuropathy? That sounds dreadful. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. A little ache is what happens when you get old. I don’t need a blood test to tell me that. And I certainly don’t need any fancy words thrown at me. I think I’ve had enough of this. I’m going home now. Thank you very much for your time. But I think I'll stick to my own judgment. And maybe a nice foot soak.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. And I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. I wouldn’t recommend anything unless I thought it was truly beneficial. The blood test is just a simple precaution. It will help us determine if we need to make any small changes to help keep your feet healthy and prevent any further discomfort. Even if it’s just a little ache now, addressing it early can make a big difference in the long run. If you’re hesitant about a full blood panel, we can start with just a fasting blood sugar test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A…fasting blood sugar test? Just the one thing? And you promise no poking and prodding? My niece will be furious if I ignore her completely. She thinks you doctors know everything. Fine. Just the one test. But if it takes all day, I’m leaving. And I want the results immediately. I haven’t got all day to sit around waiting. But don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. Just the fasting blood sugar test it is. It will only take a few minutes of your time, and we can get the results back quickly, usually within a day or two. I will write you a lab order, and the nurse will be right in to draw the blood. She’ll explain the process to you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to wear comfortable shoes and keeping your feet clean and dry. If you notice any changes – increased pain, redness, or sores – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Thank you for being willing to try this. I think it's a good step towards ensuring your continued health and comfort.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can go home and soak my feet. And don't expect me to come back for a follow-up unless something is terribly, terribly wrong. .
