DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Billman. Thank you for seeing me. It is… a check-up, really. A remote one, you said? My niece, she set this up for me. I am not so good with the computers, you understand. Just wanting to make sure everything is… alright. I am 57, and things start to… feel things, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, a check-up. That’s good. And yes, I understand about the computers. We'll get through this. "Things start to feel things," I hear you. That's a perfectly valid way to put it. Now, just to clarify, when you say "everything is alright," is there anything specific you've been concerned about?
PATIENT: Specific… Hmm. Not a pain, exactly. More… tired, I think. Always tired. And sometimes… my hands. They shake a little. Not all the time, but when I try to… do small things. Like button my coat, or hold a cup. It is not a big shake, but it is… noticeable. My husband, he used to say… but he is gone now. So. Just the tiredness and the hands, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, tiredness and shaking hands. How long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time now. Maybe… six months? Or more? It is hard to say, really. It just… crept up on me. I used to be able to work all day at the garage, no problem. Now… I need to sit down after just a little while. It is… frustrating. I like to keep busy, you see.
DOCTOR: Six months, creeping up on you. I understand. And you mentioned working at the garage... what kind of work did you do there?
PATIENT: I was a mechanic, Doctor. For… forty years. Cars, trucks… I could fix anything. Engines, brakes, everything. It was good work. Hard work, but good. Now… I mostly just help my son with paperwork. He took over the garage when I… slowed down. It is hard to not do things, you know?
DOCTOR: Forty years as a mechanic – that's impressive! Very physically demanding work. Alright. So, aside from the tiredness and the hand shaking, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I sometimes feel a little… dizzy. Not falling over, just… lightheaded. And my legs… they ache sometimes, especially at night. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… heaviness. And… oh! I forget things now. Little things, mostly. Where I put my keys, what I was going to say. Nothing too bad, but… it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, leg aching, and some forgetfulness. We’re building a picture here. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I don't know. I have not been… weighing myself, Doctor. I think… maybe a little less? But not on purpose. I still eat, you understand. Just… not as much, perhaps. It is hard to say. My clothes… feel a little looser, maybe. But I am not sure if that is the weight, or just… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, possibly some weight loss. We'll look into that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Never have. I always thought… if you can fix a car, you can fix yourself. Silly, I know. But I like to avoid pills if I can. My mother, she was always sick… always taking something. I never wanted that. Just vitamins sometimes, but not regularly. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That’s good to know. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, the doctor told me once, a long time ago. Maybe ten years? But it was just a little high, he said. He told me to watch my salt. And… no, nothing else. No diabetes, no heart problems. I’ve always been strong, you see. Worked with my hands all my life. But the tiredness… it is worrying me. I feel… not myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure. We'll check that today. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not allergic to anything. Never have been. I can touch anything, eat anything. My husband, he was allergic to cats. Very bad allergies. But me? Nothing. I am a strong Czech woman, you understand. We are made of tough stuff. But this… this tiredness is new. And the hands… they scare me a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she died when I was young. A sickness, the doctors said. I don’t know what. My father… he was strong, like me. Worked in a factory. He lived a long life, but he had a bad heart in the end. My brother… he had problems with his lungs. Smoked too much, you see. And my husband… he died suddenly, a heart attack. So… heart trouble, mostly. And some lung problems. That is my family. Not a very healthy bunch, if you ask me. But I always thought I was strong enough to avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and some lung issues. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! I do not smoke! Never have, never will. Bad for the lungs, you see. And I drink very little. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And… recreational drugs? Heavens no! I am a respectable woman, Doctor. I worked hard all my life. I do not need such things. Just good food, good work, and a clean life. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. Very good. Now, finally, let’s do a quick physical exam. We’ll start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope everything is alright. I feel… a little nervous now, you see. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time. But I trust you. Do what you need to do. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart rate is regular, but a little fast, 88 beats per minute. Pulses are a little weak. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Sounds are clear, but slightly diminished. Now, let me take a look at your hands. I notice a slight tremor when you extend them. Can you grip my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It is a little harder to grip now, you see. Not as strong as it used to be. My hands… they just don't listen anymore. It scares me, Doctor. I used to be able to fix anything with these hands. Now… I can barely button my coat. What is wrong, Doctor? Is it something serious? I am a strong woman, but I feel… weak. Very weak.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Benites. Your grip strength is somewhat diminished, and there is a slight tremor, as we discussed. Your reflexes are also a little slow. Based on your symptoms – the tiredness, the shaking hands, the dizziness, the leg aches, the forgetfulness, and what I'm finding on the exam – it's too early to say definitively, but these findings could suggest a few different possibilities. We need to run some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying infections or inflammatory conditions. We should also consider a possible neurological evaluation to further investigate the tremor and weakness. I am going to order some labs now. It is important to get to the bottom of this. We'll start with a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Tests? So it is something serious? I was hoping… I was hoping it was just old age. What kind of conditions are you thinking of, Doctor? Neurological… that sounds scary. I just want to feel better, you see. Is it something I can fix? Like a car engine? Can you fix it, Doctor? I trust you, but… please tell me what is happening. And how long will the tests take? I have my son, he is very busy. I don’t want to worry him too much.
DOCTOR: Ms. Benites, it's important to remember that running tests doesn’t automatically mean it’s something serious. It simply means we’re gathering information to understand what’s causing your symptoms. As for what we're considering… several things could be causing this. It could be a thyroid problem, a vitamin deficiency, or something affecting your nerves. In rare cases, it could be an early sign of a neurological condition, but we're not jumping to any conclusions. That’s why the tests are so important. As for "fixing it," yes, many of these conditions are treatable. Like a car engine, sometimes you just need to replace a part or adjust a setting. And I will do everything I can to get you the right diagnosis and treatment plan. The lab tests should take a few days to come back, typically 3-5 business days. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week so we can review the results together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Three to five days… I can manage that. And a follow-up appointment… yes, that is good. I want to know what is happening, you see. I need to know. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for not dismissing me, and for explaining everything. It is… comforting, to know you are taking me seriously. I will try to rest, and drink more water. My son… I will tell him. He worries about me, you see. But I will tell him everything is under control, with your help. Is there anything… anything I should be watching out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that are particularly concerning? I don’t want to panic, but… I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. In the meantime, if you experience any of the following, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room: sudden severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, loss of vision, or any confusion. These are unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. Otherwise, just focus on resting and staying hydrated. I’m going to write out a list of these symptoms for you to take home. I'll also send the lab orders to the lab electronically, and I’ll give you a slip with the lab’s address and phone number. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all, for now. Thank you again, for everything. I feel a little better, knowing you are on the case. I will try not to worry too much, and I will contact you immediately if anything changes. I appreciate your kindness, Doctor Billman. It makes a big difference. I will see you next week, then. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It was my pleasure. Remember, if anything at all changes, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. Good day to you as well.
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you, again.
