DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been feeling awfully tired during the day, even though I’m using the machine they gave me for my sleep apnea. It’s just… draining, you know? I thought it was supposed to help with the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tiredness even with the CPAP machine, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I’m pretty good about using it every night, I really am. My ex-wife would have my hide if I wasn’t diligent! But even after a full night with it on, I’m still dragging myself through the day. It's not like I'm bouncing off the walls with energy, that’s for sure. And it’s been going on for a few months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. Well, it’s good you’re consistent with the machine, that rules out one potential issue. But tiredness can be caused by a lot of things. Let’s try to narrow it down. Besides the fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my memory hasn’t been the best lately, though it’s hard to say if that’s just getting older, you know? I used to be able to recall dates and names like it was yesterday. And… I think I’ve been a little more irritable than usual. My neighbor, bless his heart, he says I snap at him too much when he tries to chat. He’s a good man, but I haven’t been myself lately. Oh, and sometimes I wake up with a dry mouth, even with the humidifier on the machine. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Dry mouth, memory issues, irritability… yes, that all gives me something to work with. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My appetite hasn't really changed, I still enjoy a good meal. Though I haven't been cooking as much, to be honest. I used to love making paella, but these days… it’s just easier to get something simple. As for weight… well, I think I’ve lost a few pounds, maybe five or ten. It’s probably a good thing, honestly. I’ve always carried a little extra weight. But it wasn’t intentional, if that makes sense. I haven’t been trying to lose weight.
DOCTOR: No intentional weight loss… alright. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of, besides the sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. The doctor checks it regularly. Oh, and I had a knee replacement a few years back, but that's healed up nicely. I get a little ache now and then, especially when it’s cold, but nothing major. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-five, so I guess good genes are on my side!
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, knee replacement… good to know. And a family history of longevity is always encouraging. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once a day for the blood pressure. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knee, when it’s acting up. But not every day, just when I need it. And… oh, I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. That's about it, I think. I try to keep things simple. I don't like taking too many pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, lisinopril, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don’t. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, which I’m very grateful for. My ex-wife is terribly allergic to pollen, poor thing. She’s always sneezing and wheezing. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I want, and take most medications without any problems. It's one less thing to worry about, you know?
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Paske, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. I’m here to figure out what’s going on, and I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. That's a bit higher than we'd like, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 82. Now, let me take a look in your ears… Ears look clear, no signs of infection. And finally, let me take a look at your throat… Throat looks a little dry, but otherwise normal. No redness or swelling. Everything seems reasonably normal, but the elevated blood pressure and dry throat are worth noting. Now, let's talk about some possible explanations.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds good. Or, as good as can be, I suppose, with the blood pressure a little high. So, what do you think could be going on, Doctor? Could it be something with the machine? Or maybe a side effect of the blood pressure medication? I'm just trying to understand what we're dealing with here. It's frustrating to be tired all the time, even when I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do.
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a few things. The machine itself is functioning, you're diligent with its use, so we can rule out simple non-compliance. It's less likely to be a direct side effect of lisinopril causing this level of fatigue, but it's not entirely impossible. However, given your age, the dry mouth, and the elevated blood pressure, I’m leaning towards exploring other possibilities. It's possible that you may be experiencing a mild form of obstructive sleep apnea, despite being on the CPAP machine. Sometimes the machine isn’t set at the optimal pressure, or you could have a leak that’s reducing its effectiveness. Also, and this is something we need to consider, is the possibility of something else contributing to the fatigue, like vitamin deficiencies or even a thyroid issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. We should also repeat the sleep study to assess the effectiveness of your current CPAP settings. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That all makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly. Yes, absolutely, let’s do the blood tests and repeat the sleep study. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment. A leak in the mask could definitely be happening, I haven’t really checked it thoroughly in a while. And the vitamin deficiency thing… well, I haven’t been eating the healthiest lately, to be honest. So, that’s a possibility. What’s the next step? Do I need to schedule an appointment for the blood tests? And how long does the sleep study take?
DOCTOR: Good. We'll get those tests ordered right away. I'll have my nurse, Maria, draw the blood samples here in the office before you leave. It's a standard procedure, shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. As for the sleep study, you'll need to schedule an appointment with the sleep center. The study itself typically takes one night, where you'll be monitored while you sleep. They'll attach sensors to your body to track your brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and oxygen levels. They'll review the data and provide a report, which we can discuss at a follow-up appointment. I'll also write you a prescription for a new CPAP mask and recommend a more thorough cleaning routine for your existing machine. I want to rule out any potential issues with the equipment itself. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet as much as possible. Also, try to limit caffeine and alcohol, as those can disrupt your sleep. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very thorough plan, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll schedule the sleep study as soon as I get home. And I’ll definitely get a new mask and be more diligent with cleaning the machine. I’ll also try to cut back on the caffeine, that might be a good idea anyway. Maria, you said? Okay, I’ll look for her after we talk. Thank you both for your help. Hopefully, we can get this figured out soon. It’s just… tiring being tired, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Paske. It's frustrating to deal with unexplained fatigue, but we're going to get to the bottom of this. We'll take it one step at a time. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. You've been very helpful and thorough. I feel a lot better knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again. I'll see you at the follow-up appointment then. And thank you to Maria as well, when she comes in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. We'll get this sorted out. I'll see you at the follow-up. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: .
