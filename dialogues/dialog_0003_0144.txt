DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Efficient? Oh, that's good. My time is valuable, you know. I was a surgical tech for… well, a long time. Long enough to know what’s what. What exactly am I here for again? I get these appointments scheduled… sometimes I just go with the flow.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, according to the system, you’re here for a general check-up… and, it appears, some complaints of fatigue?
PATIENT: Fatigue… is that what they're calling it now? Honestly, I just feel… old. And things don’t work like they used to. But fatigue… sounds like something young people complain about. Is that what they think is wrong with me? Just… tired?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, with all due respect, it's a rather broad symptom. "Feeling old," as you put it, isn't a medical diagnosis. We need to delineate specifics. Can you describe when you experience this fatigue?
PATIENT: Specifics… honestly, when don't I feel tired? It’s not like it comes and goes. It’s just… always there. But if you need me to think… maybe it’s worse after I garden. I used to have such a green thumb, but now… bending over, getting back up… it takes it out of me. And doing the housework, of course. It’s never-ending, you know? But I always did it myself. Help these days… you can’t trust anyone.
DOCTOR: So, exertion exacerbates the fatigue. And you’ve noticed this particularly with gardening and housework. Any other activities that worsen it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, visiting my daughter, for one. Not that I don’t want to see her, but all that driving… and then she expects me to play with the grandchildren all day. Precious little dears, they are, but… exhausting. It’s a long day, you know? A very long day. And honestly, just thinking about all the things I have to do… that tires me out too.
DOCTOR: So, physical activity and mental exertion contribute. Are you experiencing any difficulty with… sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, don't even get me started. I go to bed early enough, always have. But then I lie there. And lie there. Tossing and turning. Thinking about… well, everything. And then, when I finally do drift off, it's not a restful sleep. I wake up just as tired as when I went to bed. It’s just old age, I tell you. Nothing anyone can do about it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, while age is a factor, we do need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I still enjoy a good meal. Though, I don’t bake as much anymore. Too much effort, you know? And my daughter keeps bringing over those… healthy things. Salads and… I don’t even know what some of them are. Give me a nice roast chicken any day. But no, I haven’t lost my appetite. Just…picky, maybe. Is that what you’re asking?
DOCTOR: No, not precisely. And, just to be thorough, any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, goodness. Well, the doctor always said I carried a few extra pounds. Which was fine. I always had a good figure, even with a bit of extra. But… I suppose my clothes are a little looser, now that you mention it. But I haven’t been trying to lose weight. It just… happened. Probably just from not eating as much of those healthy salads my daughter brings over.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any muscle weakness, perhaps difficulty climbing stairs or lifting objects?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now you’re talking. That’s exactly it. Climbing the stairs… I have to use the railing now. Always used to be able to run up them, two at a time even! And lifting groceries? Forget about it. I used to carry everything in at once. Now I have to make multiple trips. It’s humiliating, honestly. It’s just… everything is harder now. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Blood pressure first. 138 over 82. Not terrible, but slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. And I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, particularly in your lower extremities. I'm also going to check your gait. Please walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need. But honestly, you don’t need a doctor to tell me I’m not as spry as I used to be. I know my own body. There. Happy now? It’s a little wobbly, I suppose. But what can you expect? I'm not a spring chicken, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I observed a slightly shuffling gait and reduced arm swing. And I noticed some mild weakness in your lower legs. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and vitamin D levels – just to rule out any underlying deficiencies. I’d also like to order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. And given your symptoms and examination findings, I'm going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. We need to rule out any neurological causes for your weakness and fatigue.
PATIENT: Neurologist? Oh, goodness. What does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? I thought you said it was just old age! Are you saying… is it something… serious? And what about all these tests? I hate needles. And a neurologist… that sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, a referral doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It's simply a precautionary measure to investigate the cause of your symptoms more thoroughly. We haven't reached a diagnosis yet. The tests are routine, and the blood draw is quick. As for the neurologist, they specialize in disorders of the nervous system, and will be able to determine if there's any underlying nerve damage or other neurological condition contributing to your weakness and fatigue. It's best to be thorough, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Thorough… yes, I suppose so. But a neurologist… honestly. I always thought doctors were supposed to fix things, not send you to other doctors. It just seems like a lot of fuss over… well, getting old. Fine. Do the tests. Send me to the neurologist. But if it turns out to be nothing… I’m holding you personally responsible for all the aggravation. And please, no more talk about nerve damage. That sounds dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Calvery. Here are your lab orders. The phlebotomist will take care of the blood draw. And here's the referral form for the neurologist. Their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with your regular activities as much as you can, but avoid overexertion. We'll review the results of the tests when they come back, and then we can discuss the next steps. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Assist me? Just get me out of here. And try to find a neurologist who understands that not every ache and pain means I'm falling apart. Honestly, this whole visit has been… exhausting. No, that’s all. Just… get me out of here.
