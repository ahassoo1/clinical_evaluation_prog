DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Really, I don't quite know why I'm here. My husband insisted. Something about… a social visit? I’ve just moved to the area, you see, and he’s very particular about these things. Medicare requested it, I believe. Honestly, it’s all rather…fussy.
DOCTOR: A mandatory visit, you say?
PATIENT: Mandatory is a strong word, Doctor. Let’s just say strongly encouraged. My Reginald believes in following protocol. He always has. It’s… exhausting, frankly. Are we quite finished? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Well, “strongly encouraged” visits often reveal things patients themselves haven’t noticed. It’s a courtesy, really. Now, Candice, even if Reginald is the driving force behind this, let’s just run through a few basic questions, alright?
PATIENT: Questions? Oh dear. Well, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I haven’t the patience for lengthy…proceedings. Do get on with it, then.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: Unwell? Goodness, at my age, one is always feeling something, Doctor. A little ache here, a little stiffness there. It’s called getting older. Is that what you want to know? I suppose I tire more easily than I used to. But that could be the garden, you know. It’s a rather large garden.
DOCTOR: “Large garden.” Right. And besides the fatigue, are there any specific symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Honestly, I’m not quite sure what you mean. Do you mean have I been feeling…sad? No, not particularly. Annoyed, perhaps. Reginald’s constant fussing is rather trying. But that hardly constitutes a symptom, does it? I have no illnesses, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Let's try this another way. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well… Reginald has been trying to get me to eat more vegetables. He says my plate isn’t “colorful enough.” So, I suppose I’ve been eating more than usual, though I certainly don’t want to. Is that what you mean? Honestly, this is all rather pointless, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh, yes. Reginald snores. Dreadfully. It’s been a constant battle for…well, decades, really. I have to wear earplugs. Does he need to be examined? Because honestly, that would be far more productive than questioning me.
DOCTOR: We’re focusing on your health today, Candice. Now, besides the snoring, do you have any difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes I wake up thinking about all the things Reginald will want me to do. The garden needs weeding, the silver needs polishing, and he’s decided the curtains need replacing. It’s…distracting. But falling asleep itself isn’t the problem. It’s the staying asleep part, if you must know. Honestly, this is all very tedious.
DOCTOR: And when you wake up during the night, what exactly is going through your mind?
PATIENT: Oh, just…the list, Doctor. The endless list of things Reginald requires. I rehearse it, you see. To make sure I haven't forgotten anything. It’s a very long list. And then I worry that I have forgotten something, and then I have to get up and check… Honestly, it’s exhausting. Can we please be done now? I'm starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: You're saying you wake up worrying about tasks?
PATIENT: Yes! Precisely! Do you think I haven't been clear? Reginald is…demanding, Doctor. He keeps everything running like a Swiss watch, and I’m the one who has to wind it. It’s…stressful. And quite frankly, it’s none of your business.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Let’s try a different approach. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, heavens no. I haven’t dared step on the scale in…well, let’s not discuss it. Reginald would have a fit. He’s very particular about…proportions, you see. But no, I haven’t noticed any changes. I eat what I’m given. And that is all. Can we please wrap this up? I've an appointment with my hairdresser.
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. I think I have enough information for now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want me to stand up? After all this questioning? Very well. Though I must warn you, my knees aren't what they used to be. And do be careful. I bruise easily. Honestly, this is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: If you could step onto the scale, please. And then we'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I expect you won’t mention the number to Reginald. He’ll simply fuss. Do hurry, Doctor. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: 145 pounds. Alright. Now, if you’ll have a seat here, I’ll check your blood pressure. 160 over 92…Not ideal. A little crackling in the lungs…
PATIENT: Crackling? Goodness. That sounds dreadful. Is it serious, Doctor? I do hope it’s not contagious. Reginald would be furious if I gave him anything. And please, do be quick. I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded again.
DOCTOR: It’s not contagious, Candice. But it’s something we need to investigate further. And honestly, your blood pressure is quite high. Given your age and your…stress, I’m concerned. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve always been a very healthy person. Until…well, until Reginald started fussing, of course. But no, no allergies. I eat everything he puts in front of me. Though I do occasionally sneak a biscuit when he’s not looking. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you currently take any medications, Candice?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no! I pride myself on avoiding anything artificial. Reginald says it weakens the constitution. Though…he does give me a little tonic sometimes. For my nerves, you see. It smells rather unpleasant, but he insists it’s good for me. Does that count as a medication? Honestly, this is becoming terribly complicated.
DOCTOR: And what is in this tonic, Candice?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. Herbs, I believe. And…something bitter. Reginald makes it himself, you see. He’s very secretive about the recipe. Says it’s a family secret. It’s supposed to…calm the nerves. Though I'm not entirely sure it does. Honestly, he probably just makes it to feel important.
DOCTOR: Candice, with all due respect, I’m concerned about your stress levels, your blood pressure, and this…tonic. I recommend we run some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. And I think a referral to a cardiologist wouldn't be a bad idea either. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A cardiologist? Heavens, no! That sounds…excessive. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps, and a little stressed. But who isn’t? I will not be subjected to unnecessary poking and prodding. And Reginald certainly won’t approve. This has been a complete waste of my time. I think I’ll just go home and have a lie-down.
DOCTOR: Candice, I understand your reluctance, but I am obligated to ensure your health and well-being. Ignoring these symptoms could have serious consequences. I strongly recommend you reconsider. At the very least, let’s do the blood tests. It’s a simple procedure. And frankly, your husband’s approval doesn't override my professional medical opinion. I'm going to order the blood tests and a basic EKG. If the results are concerning, we’ll discuss a referral to a cardiologist. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Do what you must. But don't expect me to be grateful. And if anything goes wrong, I’m blaming you. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Just get it over with, then. But I expect a full report afterward, and I want it explained in layman’s terms. I have no patience for medical jargon. And do try not to poke too hard. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get started. The lab technician will be in shortly. I'll have the results sent to you as soon as they are available. And I'll make sure the report is in plain English. And for the record, Candice, I'm doing this for your benefit. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
