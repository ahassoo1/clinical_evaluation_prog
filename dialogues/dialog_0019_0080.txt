DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you too. I'm just here to get some forms filled out, if that's alright. Medicare sent me a bunch and I figured it was easier to do it with someone explaining things if I got stuck.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly alright, Thyra. Medicare forms can be a bit…dense. That’s what I’m here for. No need to feel stressed about it at all. Let's take a look at those forms. Do you have them with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here they are. There's quite a pile, huh? I wasn't sure where to even start, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, they do like to cover all their bases! Don't worry, we'll tackle them one at a time. Let’s start with this first one – it looks like a basic health information form. It asks about your current medications and allergies. Do you mind if we start there?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. Medications and allergies… okay. I don’t take a whole lot of medicine regularly. Just a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I’m allergic to penicillin. Gives me a really bad rash. Other than that, I’m pretty good. Is there a specific way you want me to write it down? Like, do you need the dosage or anything?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and yes, confirming the Lisinopril is helpful. For documentation, if you don't mind, could you tell me the dosage of the Lisinopril you take?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. It’s 20 milligrams. I take one tablet every morning. I usually take it with my breakfast. It's pretty easy to remember that way.
DOCTOR: Perfect, thank you. And the penicillin allergy - was that a skin rash, hives, or something else?
PATIENT: It was a really bad skin rash. Like, all over, super itchy and bumpy. And it happened really fast, too. I took the penicillin and within a couple of hours I was covered. Had to go to the emergency room. I haven’t taken it since, and I always make sure to tell doctors about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, thank you for sharing that detail. We’ll make sure that’s clearly documented so you don’t accidentally receive penicillin again. Now, this next form asks about your past medical history – any major illnesses or surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that was probably… twenty years ago? And I broke my arm when I was in high school, playing basketball. Nothing major since then, thankfully. Oh! And I had pneumonia a few years back, but it wasn't too bad. I recovered pretty quickly with antibiotics. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good start. Appendix removal, broken arm, and pneumonia – all helpful to know. Do you remember approximately when you had the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Let me see… it was probably… 2021? Early 2021, I think. January or February. It was right before the really bad snowstorm we had that year. I was pretty sick for about a week. Had to stay home from work. My husband, Ben, took good care of me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, early 2021. That's helpful. And you said Ben took care of you – do you live at home with him?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. We've been married for fifteen years. We live on a little bit of land just outside of town. It's quiet out there, which is nice. He does most of the gardening now, my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. And the mention of your knees… do you have any ongoing pain or difficulty with them?
PATIENT: Well, they bother me sometimes, especially when it's cold or damp. Just aches and stiffness, nothing too serious. I try to stay active, but it's hard when they're acting up. Mostly I just try to take it easy and not overdo it. It's probably just getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily just "getting old", Thyra. Aches and stiffness can have a lot of different causes. We can note it for now and if it worsens, we can explore options for managing it. Now, before we move on, do you have any known family history of medical conditions – like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mom had heart problems later in life. She had a pacemaker put in a few years before she passed away. And my grandpa on my dad’s side had diabetes. I think that’s about it, honestly. We weren’t a big family for talking about health stuff, so I don't know a whole lot. It was mostly just… keeping things to ourselves, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We’ll document the heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your grandfather. It's alright that you don't know all the details – we can work with what you do know. Finally, before we finish these forms, are there any allergies to medications other than penicillin?
PATIENT: No, just the penicillin. I haven't had any reactions to anything else as far as I know. I’ve taken ibuprofen and acetaminophen for headaches and things, and those have always been fine. I’m usually pretty careful about what I take, just to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, no other medication allergies. Okay, that completes these forms for now. I know it was a lot of information, but you did great. Is there anything you were hoping to discuss today, aside from getting these filled out?
