DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Jezik. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Time… slips away, you know? It’s just… annoying, mostly. Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be frustrating when things like that start happening. “A bit now” is helpful, but we can try to narrow it down if you can remember anything specific. Has it been weeks, months…?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I think. Maybe… six? Seven? It started after… well, after I retired, I believe. From the plant. Water treatment. Long time doing that. Not the most… glamorous work, but kept me busy. Honestly, I don’t remember much before retirement, either. It's all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. Memory can be tricky. Six to seven months is a good starting point. And thank you for sharing that about your work. It’s good to know. Now, this shaking… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I… try to do something precise. Like, buttoning my shirt. Or… holding a cup of coffee. That's when I really notice it. When I'm just sitting… it’s not so bad. But trying to do things… that’s when it gets frustrating. And it seems to be getting… worse, I suppose. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, more noticeable with fine motor skills and seems to be gradually worsening. Is it just your hands that shake, or do you notice it in other parts of your body as well?
PATIENT: Just my hands, I think. Maybe a little bit in my arm sometimes, but it's hard to tell. It could just be… old age, you know? Everything gets a little shaky when you get to be my age. I don’t pay much attention to it unless it interferes with something. Like eating soup. That's a disaster.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're bringing it to my attention now, even if it seems minor at times. We want to make sure we rule out anything that might be causing it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Well, I’ve been… a little tired lately. But who isn’t? And my… balance isn't what it used to be. But again, old age, probably. I haven't fallen or anything. No dizziness or anything like that. Just… feeling a bit unsteady sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue and a feeling of unsteadiness. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, or any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain. Some aches, maybe, but nothing I haven’t had for years. Old sports injuries, mostly. I used to play… soccer. A long time ago. But no, no stiffness. Just… the shaking. And the tiredness. And… well, sometimes I forget things. But I always have.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight…? No, not really. I… I eat when I’m hungry. I don't weigh myself or anything. Maybe I've lost a little. I'm not sure. It’s hard to keep track of those things. I mostly eat… whatever’s easy. Soup, mostly. When I can manage it without… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something… years ago. But I don’t take any pills for it. He said it wasn’t too bad. Nothing else, I don’t think. No diabetes. No heart problems. I used to be quite healthy, actually. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible history of high blood pressure. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… My appendix, when I was a boy. And… I think I had a hernia operation, years ago. That's all I can remember. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I don’t take many pills, so I haven’t had much chance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take something for sleep. Just when I can’t get to sleep. It’s… a small pill. I don’t remember the name. I get it from the drugstore. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have a family history of any medical conditions, like Parkinson’s disease, tremors, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly. And my father… he died young. Heart attack, I believe. I don't think anyone else had… shaking. Or anything like that. We weren't a very… medical family.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik, that’s very helpful. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with, please. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won’t take long. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and coordination. And finally, I’ll take a look at your hands and arms. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Another one… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm… good. And now your other arm. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. I notice a slight tremor in your right hand when you extend your arm, even at rest. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Your range of motion is good, and there’s no pain when I move your joints.
PATIENT: Tremor, huh? I knew it. It's getting worse. So, what does it mean, Doctor? Is it something… serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Jezik, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. The tremor, along with the fatigue and feeling of unsteadiness, could be caused by a number of things. It could be related to your age, essential tremor, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. And, given your history of possible high blood pressure, I’d like to check your blood pressure today to see where it stands. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, do whatever you need to do. Blood tests, blood pressure… get it over with. I just want to know what's going on. And if there's something I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I’ll get the lab order for the blood tests and have the nurse check your blood pressure right away. It will take a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms, such as difficulty walking, changes in your speech, or increased stiffness, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get the tests done, please. And tell me what’s going on. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Jezik. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and check your blood pressure. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. .
