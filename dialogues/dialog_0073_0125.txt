DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, to be honest, it's... a bit embarrassing, really. My wife suggested I come get checked for, you know... the HIV thing. Just to be sure, she said. Honestly, I think she worries too much, but better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. "The HIV thing," as you put it. A sensible precaution, I suppose, though I wouldn't characterize your wife's concern as excessive. It's always best to be proactive with one's health. Let's get some details, shall we?
PATIENT: Details? What kind of details? I mean, I haven't... done anything risky, if that's what you're getting at. We’ve been married for eight years, and before that… well, it was nothing serious. I just want to know if I need to worry, that's all. It's not like I spend my time... you know. Is this going to be a long process? Because I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I assure you, this isn't an interrogation. And no, it won't necessarily be long, but a proper assessment requires some information. "Risky" is a subjective term. We need to discuss your sexual history, if you don't mind. It’s standard procedure. We'll start with the basics. Have you ever had a sexually transmitted infection – anything diagnosed – in the past?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is a bit… much, isn’t it? I told you I haven't done anything. And now you're asking about... that? Look, I'm a married man, a respectable Compliance Officer. I don’t go around collecting STDs. No, I haven’t had anything diagnosed. Never. Are you implying something? It’s a bit rude, frankly. I’m starting to regret coming here. Perhaps this wasn't necessary after all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your discomfort, truly. However, to provide even a basic level of care, I must gather a complete history. Absence of symptoms does not equal absence of risk. It's a matter of responsible medicine. And no, I am not implying anything. Simply attempting to rule things out. Now, have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? What on earth does that have to do with anything? I've never needed one, no. I'm perfectly healthy. This is ridiculous. You're asking me all these personal questions like I'm some sort of… well, I don’t even know. I thought doctors were supposed to be about fixing problems, not digging up dirt. Are you sure this test is even necessary? My wife just overthinks everything. Honestly, the stress of all this is probably worse than whatever she's worried about.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, your current state of… agitation isn’t helping us assess anything. Blood transfusions, while uncommon, are a potential route of transmission. It's a routine question. Let's move on. Have you ever shared needles, even for something as seemingly innocuous as recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Are you serious? Recreational drug use?! Now you're just being insulting. I am a married man, a professional, a respectable member of society! I would never touch those things. This is absolutely preposterous! I think I’ve had enough. I want to speak to your supervisor. This whole experience has been incredibly offensive and a complete waste of my time. I’m leaving. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. It seems you are not interested in a proper medical evaluation. I strongly advise you reconsider. However, I will respect your decision. Should you change your mind, my staff will be happy to schedule another appointment. And for your wife's peace of mind, I can document our conversation, highlighting your refusal of standard testing protocols. Good day to you as well. .
