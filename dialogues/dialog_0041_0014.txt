DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… now let me see. My wife, she says I need some… papers. For work. Something about needing time off, or… maybe not working at all for a bit? It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. She handles most of that sort of thing. Something about FMLA, she mentioned that name. Or disability… one of those.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's… helpful, sort of. So it sounds like your wife is concerned about your ability to continue working and is looking into options like FMLA or disability?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. She’s a very organized woman, my wife. I… well, I mostly just do what I'm told these days, if I’m being honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m still able to do my work, mostly, directing things at the church… but sometimes I get… lost in thought, you know? It’s hard to explain. I just need the papers, whatever they are, so she can get everything sorted. Is that something you can help with?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We can definitely get you started on the paperwork needed for FMLA or disability, or figure out what’s best. It’s good she’s being proactive. To help me understand what kind of paperwork we need, and to make sure we’re going down the right path, could you tell me a little more about why your wife is concerned?
PATIENT: Well… hmm. It's not one big thing, you see. It’s just… little things adding up. I forget where I put things. Important things, sometimes. Like my glasses, just a moment ago! And I sometimes struggle to remember names, even people I’ve known for years. It’s embarrassing, really. And she says I’ve been… quieter, more withdrawn. Less like myself, she says. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be truthful. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, that is helpful, thank you. So, memory issues, some difficulty with recall, and a change in your usual demeanor… That gives me a better picture. And this has been happening… how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky question. It’s been… gradual, you see? It didn’t just happen overnight. Probably… the last six months or so, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started. My wife noticed it before I did, she always has been very observant. It's just… gotten a little worse lately, I suppose. She says I repeat myself sometimes too, which I don’t remember doing!
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of progressive memory issues, changes in behavior, and some repetition… Okay. And has anything specific triggered this, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Triggered? Hmm… not that I know of. No big accidents or illnesses. No major life changes, except… well, my oldest grandson started college last year. That was a bit emotional, saying goodbye to him. But that was a good thing, a happy thing! No, I can’t think of anything that would have caused this. It just… sort of crept up on me. My wife keeps asking if I'm stressed about something, but I don't feel particularly stressed. Just… forgetful, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no obvious trigger… And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me see… Well, sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not falling or anything, just a bit wobbly. And I’ve been sleeping… more than usual. Napping a lot during the day. And I've noticed I get frustrated easily now. Little things that wouldn't bother me before, they just… get to me. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, those could all be relevant. Unsteadiness, increased sleepiness, and increased irritability… Okay. Now, just to get a fuller picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now, with medication. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a very long time ago! Oh, and I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious. My wife keeps a list of all my medications, she’s very organized. I can't remember everything off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure managed with medication, appendectomy long ago, and some arthritis… And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the blood pressure. I take… let me see… Lisinopril, I think it is. One pill every morning. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take Ibuprofen. Just when I need it, you know? Nothing regularly. And… oh! My wife also makes me take a Vitamin D supplement, she says I don’t get enough sunshine. She's always looking after me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D supplement… And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get stung by bees when I was a boy, playing in the garden, but that was just a little sting. Nothing serious. My wife always asks me that question too, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Ronnald, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your memory, sleep, and overall well-being. These symptoms could be caused by a number of things, and it’s important to investigate further. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to check your reflexes, balance, and general neurological function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what's going on. It's just… unsettling, you know? Forgetting things, feeling tired… It’s not like me. A physical exam sounds good. Anything to help get to the bottom of things.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just step over here and sit on the table for me. First, I’m just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little on the slower side, but that’s not uncommon with age. Now, let’s check your balance… Balance is a little unsteady, but you're able to maintain it. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. It's not conclusive, but it gives me a little more information.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't too bad, was it? I don't think I'm very good at standing on one leg! What do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? My wife will be so worried if it's something serious… She always worries about everything. Perhaps it's just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to keep your sense of humor, Ronnald. And no, it wasn't too bad at all. Now, regarding your question… It's difficult to say definitively based on this initial examination. The changes you’re experiencing—memory issues, fatigue, unsteadiness—could be due to a number of things. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency or side effect of medication, but we also need to rule out more serious possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any infections. I also recommend a brain scan – an MRI or CT scan – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. It’s standard procedure to investigate these symptoms, and it’ll help us determine the best course of action. I want to be upfront – these symptoms could be indicative of early dementia, but it’s far too early to make that determination. These tests are essential to get a proper diagnosis. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dementia… My wife’s mother had that, I think. It was… a difficult time. So you think that’s a possibility? Brain scan… that sounds… serious. But I understand. If that’s what we need to do, we need to do it. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… please keep me informed. And please, let me know as soon as you have the results. My wife will want to know right away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ronnald. It’s natural to be worried when dementia is mentioned. And yes, given your family history, it’s something we need to consider. But, as I said, it's far too early to jump to conclusions. Many things can cause similar symptoms, and the tests will help us differentiate between them. Okay, I’ve ordered the blood tests, and I’m scheduling the brain scan for you next week. You’ll receive a call from the imaging center to confirm the appointment time. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed. I also want to emphasize the importance of staying mentally active. Engaging in activities you enjoy—reading, puzzles, social interaction—can help keep your brain sharp. I’ll review the test results as soon as they come in, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you and your wife. It will likely be in about a week or so. Do you have any questions about the tests, the schedule, or anything else?
PATIENT: A week or so… That feels like a long time to wait. But I understand. My wife is very good at keeping me mentally active. She always has me doing crossword puzzles and Sudoku. And we go to church every Sunday, that keeps me busy. I suppose… is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any symptoms that would mean I need to call you sooner?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying active, Ronnald. And yes, let’s talk about what to look out for. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – worsening memory loss, difficulty with speech, weakness on one side of your body, or any new neurological symptoms like seizures – please call me immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Also, if you become confused or disoriented, or if you have difficulty recognizing familiar people or places, please let me know right away. These are signs that require prompt medical attention. Otherwise, if your symptoms remain stable, you can wait for the test results. I’ll also send a copy of my notes and the test orders to your wife’s email address, as you mentioned she handles things. Do you have that address handy?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. Here it is. Her email is… marialimtiaco@email.com. She checks it religiously. I appreciate you sending the information to her. It puts my mind at ease knowing she's informed. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Just hoping for the best, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve sent the information to marialimtiaco@email.com. Your wife should receive it shortly. Well, Ronnald, I’ve documented everything we discussed today. We’ve ordered the necessary tests, and we’ll follow up as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We're taking the appropriate steps to figure out what's going on, and we'll develop a plan based on the results. Do you need me to write you a note for work explaining your appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Yes, please. Just something to explain that I’ve been to the doctor and am undergoing some testing. My wife can handle the details, but a note would be very helpful. Thank you so much for everything. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. It states that you’ve been seen by a physician and are undergoing testing to evaluate some recent health concerns. It doesn’t specify the nature of the concerns, to protect your privacy. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Ronnald?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. I was a bit worried coming in here, but you’ve put my mind at ease. Thank you again for everything. I’ll wait to hear from the imaging center about the appointment. And I’ll see you next week, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ronnald. I understand your worries, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, Ronnald, and please try not to stress. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: .
