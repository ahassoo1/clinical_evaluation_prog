DOCTOR: Hi Betty, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Rudi Yoshino, and I'll be your doctor today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Rudi, was it? Land sakes, it’s a bit stuffy in here, isn't it? Well, I think it's my ears. They just don’t… hear like they used to. Not sure when it started, really. Everything just seems a bit muffled, you know? Like talking underwater, maybe.
DOCTOR: Yes, Rudi is correct. It is a bit warm in here today, I’ll have to adjust the thermostat. And thank you for letting me know about your ears. “Muffled hearing,” that’s a good way to describe it. Okay, so it sounds like you’ve noticed a change in your hearing. Can you tell me roughly when you first started noticing things sounding quieter or muffled?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… now that’s a question. Seems like a long time ago, honestly. Maybe… a year or two? Could be longer, I don't rightly remember. I used to be able to hear the birds chirping clear as a bell, but now… not so much. I just figured I was gettin' old! Is that what happens, when you get old, you just… stop hearin' so well?
DOCTOR: It's very common for hearing to change as we get older, Betty, so you’re not wrong to think that might be a factor. But it’s good you came in to get it checked out, because there are a lot of different reasons why hearing can change, and we want to rule out anything else that might be going on. So, about a year or two ago… was this a sudden change, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Not like bam, all of a sudden gone. Just… slowly fading, like an old photograph. I remember my niece, Susan, saying something at Thanksgiving, and I just couldn't make out what she said. She had to repeat herself a couple times. Then it happened again with the TV, I kept turning it up and up… my neighbor complained! It's been like that ever since, I suppose. Little things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, noticing it with conversations and the TV… that's helpful. And it sounds like it's been getting progressively worse. Do you notice it more in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… certain situations… let me think. Yes, definitely when there's a lot of noise. Like, if I'm at the grocery store, it's just a jumble of sounds. Can't pick out a single word anyone’s saying. And restaurants are awful. Too much chatter, too much clinking of plates. It’s easier when it's quiet, like here, or when I'm alone in my apartment. Though even then, the TV gets turned up pretty high sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so noise makes it significantly harder. That’s very common. Do you ever experience any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears, even when it’s quiet?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that’s a funny question. Sometimes, yeah. Not all the time, mind you. Just… a sort of faint ringing, like a tiny little bell. Or maybe a humming sound? It comes and goes, mostly when I’m trying to sleep. Doesn't bother me too much, but it’s there. I figured it was just… old age again!
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me everything, Betty. That ringing – we call it tinnitus – is actually pretty common, and it can often be related to hearing loss. Okay, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Oh dear, illnesses… let me see. I had a bit of a cold last winter, I think. Nothing too bad, just a sniffle and a cough. And the flu, maybe the year before? I get a flu shot every year, though, so it usually isn't too terrible. Honestly, I can't remember the specifics, it all runs together after a while. I mostly just stay inside these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cold recently, flu a year or two ago, and you get vaccinated which is excellent. And you mostly stay indoors, alright. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises for long periods of time – like at a factory, construction site, or maybe at concerts often?
PATIENT: Oh, now that I remember! I worked at the shoe factory for… oh, goodness, nearly forty years. Lots of loud machinery, all day long. Clanging and banging, sewing machines whirring… it was noisy, alright. They gave us earplugs, but I don’t think I wore them as much as I should have. Too uncomfortable, you know? And concerts… not really. I’m not much of a concert-goer. Mostly just listened to the radio at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. A long history of noise exposure at the shoe factory… that could definitely be a factor. Alright, Betty, I'd like to do a quick hearing test just to get a better sense of what’s going on. It’s a very simple test, and it won’t hurt at all. We’ll do it right here in the examination room. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? Oh, alright dear, that sounds fine. As long as it doesn’t involve anything pokin’ or proddin’! I don’t like pokin’ or proddin’. Just tell me what to do, and I'll try my best. It’s probably just old age, like I said, but I guess it's good to be sure.
DOCTOR: No poking or prodding, I promise! It just involves wearing headphones and letting me know when you hear different tones. It'll take about 10-15 minutes. Okay, we're going to start with your right ear. I’m going to put these headphones on, and I’ll start playing some tones. When you hear a tone, just raise your hand, okay?
PATIENT: Alright dear, sounds simple enough. Headphones on, raise my hand… I can do that. Just let me know if it's going to be too loud, alright? My ears ain’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll start at a very low volume and gradually increase it until you can hear the tones. I'll be right here the whole time. Okay, Betty, just tell me if you hear the beep…
PATIENT: …No… No… Oh, wait, yes!… No… Hmm… No, can't hear that one… Yes, I think so… It’s a bit faint… No… Oh dear, this is harder than I thought!
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, we’re all finished. Thank you for your patience. Alright, so the hearing test results show a moderate to severe hearing loss, primarily in the higher frequencies, in both ears. This is consistent with what you’ve been describing – difficulty hearing conversations and needing to turn up the volume on the TV. It’s also quite common with prolonged exposure to loud noises, like you experienced at the shoe factory.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Moderate to severe… that sounds… serious. So it isn’t just old age, then? What does that mean, exactly? Will I go completely deaf? I still want to hear the birds chirping, you know. And Susan… I want to hear what Susan says at Thanksgiving!
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Betty. But let's talk about it. It isn't just old age, although aging can contribute. And no, it doesn’t mean you'll go completely deaf. It means you've lost some of your ability to hear certain sounds, specifically higher-pitched ones. That's why it's harder to hear things like birds chirping or Susan when there’s background noise. The good news is there are things we can do to help! The most common solution is hearing aids. They amplify sounds, making them easier to hear. We can also discuss strategies for coping with hearing loss, like reducing background noise and asking people to speak clearly. Would you be interested in learning more about hearing aids?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I’ve always thought those were for really old people. And I don't want to look like I’m wearing something fancy. Are they… noticeable? And how much do those things cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare doesn't cover everything, does it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very common concern, Betty, and you're not alone in thinking that. Hearing aids have come a long way in recent years. They are much smaller and more discreet than they used to be. Many of them are almost invisible. And you're right, Medicare doesn’t cover the full cost of hearing aids, unfortunately. However, there are often options to help with the cost, such as discounts, payment plans, and some supplemental insurance plans may offer partial coverage. Here’s some information about different types of hearing aids and what they look like. It also has information about financial assistance options. I can also refer you to an audiologist. They are specialists in hearing loss and can evaluate your hearing more thoroughly and recommend the best hearing aid for your needs and budget. They can also help you with the fitting and adjustment of the hearing aid. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: An audiologist… hmm. That sounds… complicated. But I guess it’s worth looking into. I do want to hear Susan, and I do miss the birds. Okay, alright. Yes, please refer me to an audiologist. And thank you, dear, for explainin’ everything so patiently. It’s a bit overwhelming, but I appreciate you not dismissin’ it as just ‘old age’.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It’s my job to help you, and you're right, it's definitely worth exploring. I’m glad I could explain things clearly. Here's the referral form. It has the audiologist’s contact information and appointment scheduling details. They will contact you to set up an appointment. Before you go, are there any other questions or concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, dear. Thank you again. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll give the audiologist a call. Oh, and… is it alright if I ask… how old are you? You don't look much older than my granddaughter!
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say! I'm 31. And thank you. It was a pleasure meeting you, Betty. I hope you have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after you see the audiologist.
PATIENT: Oh my! Thirty years old! You don't say! Well, you seem very wise for your age. It was lovely meeting you too, dear. And thank you again for everything. You’re a good doctor, a very good doctor.
