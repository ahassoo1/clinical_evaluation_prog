DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… performing, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. The agency sent me, I believe. A performance thing. I’m not quite sure what they need checked, but here I am. I’d like to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, a check-up related to performing. That’s perfectly alright. It sounds like it might be a pretty standard physical, but we’ll focus on areas important for your work. No problem at all wanting to keep things efficient. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what kind of performing you do?
PATIENT: Performing… hmm. Well, I’ve been an usher, mostly. And ticket taker. Sometimes lobby attendant. Oh, and a little bit of crowd control, I suppose you could say. Not on stage, you understand. More… around the stage. It’s been a long time though, honestly. A very long time. Is that what you meant? I don't really... act or sing.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful to know, thank you. So, a lot of standing, walking, potentially some lifting or directing people – physical roles around the theater, essentially. And you're right, not on stage performing, but important work around the performance. To get a better picture of your overall health and make sure you're fit for those kinds of tasks, let's go through a few questions. Have you been feeling any pain anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Pain? Let me think… my knees, sometimes. A little creaky, especially when the weather changes. And my back aches if I stand for too long, which… happens a lot. But it's just old age, I suppose. Nothing serious, really. I just take it easy. It’s been like that for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and lower back with some creakiness and aches, especially with standing and weather changes. That's good information. And you’ve been managing it with taking it easy, which is smart. Besides the knees and back, have you noticed any other changes in how your body feels?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. I get tired easier now, I think. Used to be able to work a whole day on my feet, no problem. Now I need a little rest in the afternoon. And my memory isn't what it used to be. But again, old age, right? I forget… what was I saying? Oh, yes. Tiredness. And a bit forgetful. It happens.
DOCTOR: It does happen, Brando. Those are good things to mention. Fatigue and some memory issues are definitely worth talking about. We’ll explore those a bit more. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any problems with your breathing, like shortness of breath or wheezing?
PATIENT: Breathing…? No, not really. I used to get a little winded climbing stairs, but that was just because I was out of shape. I haven’t noticed anything… unusual lately. No wheezing, no… trouble catching my breath. I walk a bit, you know, but nothing strenuous. Just around the neighborhood.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No recent issues with breathing. That's helpful to know. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history… That’s a bit difficult. I saw a doctor many years ago… for a cold, I think. And maybe a check-up. But I don’t recall any… diagnoses. I don’t think I have anything serious. My ex-wife used to worry about everything, but she was always a bit… anxious. I’m sure she would have mentioned something if I did. Honestly, I can't remember the details.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's common to forget details from years ago. So, as far as you know, you haven't been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Everything’s a bit blurry, you see. It's been a long time. I suppose if I had something serious, someone would have told me. But honestly, I wouldn’t remember. I really wouldn’t. Can we… get this over with soon? I'm not good with remembering things like this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brando. We'll keep things as efficient as possible. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see. No, I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take an aspirin for a headache. And sometimes a little something for indigestion. But that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements. I don’t really believe in those things. Just aspirin, when needed. And maybe some antacids.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin for headaches and antacids occasionally. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. I don’t think so. I've never had a reaction to anything. My ex-wife was allergic to cats, but that’s not me. No, I don't have any allergies. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years. No problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. The quicker we get this done, the better. I have things to do, you know. Just… please be quick. I'm not very good at standing still for long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brando. I'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Let's start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. Alright, your height is 199 centimeters and your weight is 118 kilograms. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but we can monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not concerning at this time. Ears and throat look clear. Do you experience any dizziness when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Dizziness…? Sometimes, yes. A little bit wobbly, especially if I rush. But it passes quickly. I just hold onto something for a moment. It’s probably just old age, you know. I don't think it's anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness upon standing quickly. That, combined with the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes, suggests we should do a little more investigation. I’d like to order some basic blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Also, a simple EKG to check your heart rhythm would be helpful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? Oh dear. Is that really necessary? It all sounds so… complicated. I just came for a simple check-up for performing, you know? I don't want any fuss. Are you sure it’s really needed? I'm not feeling that bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Brando. It’s true, you came for a check-up related to performing, but these tests will give us a better overall picture of your health and rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to the symptoms you are experiencing - the fatigue, occasional dizziness, and creakiness. It will allow me to give you the best possible advice for staying healthy and continuing to work comfortably. The blood work is very simple, just a few vials of blood, and the EKG is a painless test where we attach some stickers to your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. It takes only a few minutes. It's a precaution, really. Since you’re uninsured, we can discuss options for making it affordable. Would you like me to explain the costs and potential financial assistance programs available?
PATIENT: Uninsured… yes, that's another problem. And financial assistance… oh dear. This is all becoming very complicated. Very complicated indeed. I suppose… if you really think it’s necessary… alright. Do what you think is best. But please, keep it as quick and affordable as possible. I'm really not good with all this medical… stuff. Just tell me what I need to do. And how much it will cost.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brando. I understand your concerns completely. We will keep it as quick and affordable as possible. Okay, so we'll need to draw some blood and do an EKG. The blood work should cost around $150, and the EKG around $80. We can see if the lab offers a discount for paying cash. And I can provide you with resources for low-cost healthcare options in the area. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician, Sarah, is very efficient and kind. After the tests, I'll review the results with you and we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a note for light duty work for the next two weeks, just to take some pressure off while we get these tests done. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Light duty… yes, that would be helpful. Very helpful. I can’t stand on my feet all day right now. Thank you. Just… where is this room 203? And do I need to bring anything? I always forget things…
DOCTOR: Room 203 is just down the hallway on your right. You don't need to bring anything at all, just yourself. Sarah will explain everything and take care of you. Here's the note for light duty. It specifies reduced standing and lifting for two weeks. Once you’ve had the tests done, please come back to me and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you. For everything. This is all very stressful, you know. I just wanted a simple check-up. Room 203… right? I hope I remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, Room 203. You’ll do great. And don't worry, if you get lost, just ask anyone at the front desk. They'll point you in the right direction. Take your time, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
