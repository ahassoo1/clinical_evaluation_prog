DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure. My husband, he brought me in. He says my speech hasn’t been… clear lately? I just… feel a little off, I suppose. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to pinpoint exactly what’s going on when you’re feeling generally unwell. “Feeling off” is a perfectly valid way to describe it. And it's good that your husband noticed a change in your speech; that's helpful information. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing this feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start…? That’s… a tricky one. It feels like it’s been gradual. Maybe a few weeks now? It’s hard to say for sure. Things have been… busy. I’m usually on site with the construction, and I haven’t really had time to sit and think about it, if that makes sense. I just know my husband keeps asking if I’m alright.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Life gets busy, and it's easy to overlook subtle changes when you're focused on other things. A few weeks is a good starting point. When you say your speech hasn’t been clear, could you describe what your husband is noticing?
PATIENT: He says I… slur my words sometimes? Like I’m not pronouncing everything properly. And sometimes he has to ask me to repeat myself. It’s not all the time, mind you, but enough that he got worried. I haven’t noticed it myself, really. I just thought I was tired, you know? Long days out in the sun.
DOCTOR: I see. Slurring and difficulty with pronunciation are definitely things we want to investigate. It’s good your husband is observant and brought it to your attention. And it's understandable to attribute it to fatigue with your work schedule. Okay, Ms. Swaby, let’s try to get a more complete picture. Aside from the changes in speech, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… No, not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired, as I said. And maybe a bit clumsier than usual? Dropped my tools a couple of times, which isn't like me. But nothing major, Doctor. Just… little things. I haven’t been feeling sick, if that makes sense. No fever, no cough, no aches… Just off.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. “Off” and the clumsiness are important details. No fever, cough, or aches is good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… That’s another thing I’m terrible at remembering. I… I think I had chickenpox as a child, like everyone else. And I had my tonsils out when I was little. Apart from that… not much, I don’t think. Nothing serious. I usually stay quite healthy, to be honest. I work outdoors a lot, so I’m generally pretty active. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? It’s just… my memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Chickenpox and a tonsillectomy are good to know. Don’t worry about not remembering everything; we can work with what you do recall. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mother, she had… high blood pressure, I think? And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had something with his heart. But I’m not sure what exactly. It was a long time ago. Everyone’s always telling me to take care of myself, because of family history, but I honestly don't remember the specifics. It's all a bit vague.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Swaby, it's common for family medical history to be a bit vague. High blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your grandfather are useful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if possible. Just a bit of ibuprofen now and then, if I strain my back lifting things on site, but that’s it. Nothing regular, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never really had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks, but I always tell him no. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I don't wear any jewelry, either, so I've never had a reaction to metals. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You would, Ms. Swaby. That's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature – and do a neurological exam to assess your speech, coordination, and reflexes. It's just a routine check to help us understand what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? It’s unsettling not knowing. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. Okay, Ms. Swaby, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90, and your heart rate is 78, which is within the normal range. Your temperature is normal. During the neurological exam, I did notice some mild slurring of your speech and slight difficulty with coordination in your left hand. Your reflexes appear normal. I want to note these findings for documentation. These findings are concerning enough that I'd like to order some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm thinking a blood test to check for any underlying inflammation or infection, and an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… Oh dear. Is that… serious? I’ve never had one before. I’m not very good with hospitals, you know? I mean, I understand you need to be thorough, but… What are you looking for exactly? And will it take long? I have a crew waiting for me back on site… I don’t want to keep them waiting for too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Swaby, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about an MRI. It's a non-invasive imaging test, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or surgery. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. We're looking to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms, such as a stroke, a tumor, or multiple sclerosis. I want to be clear: I'm not saying you have any of these conditions, but it's important to investigate, given the mild slurring and coordination issues I observed. The MRI itself will take about 30-45 minutes. You’ll need to lie still inside the machine, and it can be a bit noisy. We’ll provide earplugs to help with that. We'll also have a technician monitoring you throughout the procedure. I know it’s a disruption to your schedule, and I apologize for that. However, it’s important to get a diagnosis so we can determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and driving until we have the results of the MRI. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Thirty to forty-five minutes… That’s… manageable, I suppose. And it doesn’t involve any needles? That’s good. No, I think I understand. A stroke, you say? That sounds… frightening. My husband… he’s a very practical man. I should probably let him be the one to drive me. And no strenuous activity… That means no lifting anything on site, correct? That’s going to be difficult. And when can I expect the results? Will it be today? I’m worried about leaving the crew unattended for too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, no lifting anything heavy or strenuous activity until we have the results. That includes anything that requires significant physical exertion. It’s best to err on the side of caution. And you are right to be concerned about leaving the crew, Ms. Swaby. We'll expedite the results as much as possible. The radiologist typically reviews the MRI images within 24-48 hours. I will personally call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the findings and next steps. I can write a note for your crew, explaining your situation and recommending a temporary supervisor if needed. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. A note explaining the situation… That would take a lot of pressure off. They’re good people, but they rely on me to keep things running smoothly. And I really do appreciate you expediting the results. I just want to get back to normal as soon as possible. So, just to be clear… no lifting, no strenuous activity, and I’ll hear back from you within two days? And you'll call me personally?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. No lifting, no strenuous activity, and I will call you personally within 48 hours with the results of the MRI. I’ll also write a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help manage any stress or worry while you’re waiting for the results. It’s not essential, but it might be helpful. Here's the note for your crew, explaining your temporary leave and suggesting a supervisor. And here's the prescription for the anti-anxiety medication. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Swaby?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Anti-anxiety medication… I haven’t taken anything like that before. Is it… strong? I wouldn’t want it to affect my work when I return. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for being so understanding. It’s a bit overwhelming, but I feel… a little better knowing what to expect. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. It’s a low dose, and most people experience minimal side effects. If you do have any concerns, don’t hesitate to contact the office. I understand it’s a lot to process, but we're here to support you every step of the way. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before I call. Have a good day, and I will be in touch soon.
