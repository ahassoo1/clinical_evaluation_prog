DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's not waste time. You’re 83 years old, in a rural location, and…uninsured. Yes, I see that. Tell me, in a concise manner, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: My eyes. They feel…dry. Real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't feel like makin' a big deal of it, but it’s gettin' old.
DOCTOR: "A while now." That is…not helpful, Mr. Pipolo. Can you quantify “a while”?
PATIENT: Quantify? You want numbers? Hmm… maybe… six months? Could be longer. Time kinda…blurs, ya know? It's just been gettin' worse lately. Makes it hard to see when I'm workin'. I pour concrete, gotta see straight.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressively worsening dryness… concrete work… Alright. And are we talking constant dryness, or is it intermittent?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. Not like it goes away for days at a time, no. It's just… always there. Like sand in 'em, almost. And wind don't help, not one bit. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: “Sand in them,” you say. Do you experience any burning, stinging, redness, or blurred vision in addition to the gritty sensation?
PATIENT: Gritty… yeah, that's the best way to put it. Sometimes a little burnin', especially when the sun’s out. Redness… hard to say. Don't look at my eyes much, ya know? Just try to get the job done. Vision's… okay, I guess. A little blurry if I stare too long. Like when I'm tryin' to read the newspaper.
DOCTOR: Alright. No relevant past ocular history noted here. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed 'em. Eyes were always good enough. 'Til now, I guess. Still see okay for most things, just… not as sharp as they used to be. Especially when it's windy and dry.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief examination. Please look straight ahead. I’ll need to assess your visual acuity, check your conjunctiva and corneas, and evaluate your tear production. It won't take long, but I need you to remain still.
PATIENT: Tear production, huh? Alright. Just tell me what to do. I ain't got all day, ya know. Gotta get back to work. Concrete don’t pour itself.
DOCTOR: Right. Uncorrected visual acuity is 20/30 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left. Not terrible for your age, but certainly diminished. Now, let me examine your eyes more closely… Conjunctival injection present bilaterally, and I observe some superficial punctate keratitis. Now, Schirmer's test… Tear production is…suboptimal, 10 millimeters in the right eye and 8 millimeters in the left after five minutes. Indicative of dry eye.
PATIENT: Suboptimal? What does that mean? Is it bad? I just want somethin' to make 'em feel better. Don't need fancy words. Is it somethin' I can get a drop for? I got a job to finish.
DOCTOR: “Suboptimal” means your eyes aren't producing enough tears to adequately lubricate themselves. And yes, it is treatable. It’s likely a case of age-related dry eye, exacerbated by your occupation and the environmental conditions. We can try artificial tears initially. I’ll write you a prescription for Systane Ultra. Use them four times a day, or as needed. However, I strongly advise you to consider wearing safety glasses when working to protect your eyes from the wind and debris. Do you have any allergies to eye drops or other medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had 'em. I just… work. Concrete, wind, sun… that's mostly my life. Safety glasses… alright. I’ll try to remember. Systane Ultra, you said? Four times a day. Okay. Can I get this prescription filled at the drugstore in town? I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, any pharmacy will suffice. And Mr. Pipolo, I cannot stress enough the importance of eye protection. Chronic dry eye can lead to corneal damage if left untreated. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any pain, redness, or vision changes, you must seek immediate attention. Understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Eye protection. Pain, redness, vision changes. Got it. Look, I appreciate it, Doc. But I really gotta get goin'. Concrete's waitin'. Thanks for the drops.
DOCTOR: Very well. Dismissed. Another one… wasting my time. .
