DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been hangin’ on for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t really hurt, just… bothersome. I don’t even remember when it started, to be honest. Seems like forever.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A cough for “forever,” you say. Right. And is it… constant?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not constant. It comes and goes. More when I… well, when it’s dry. Like, if the air’s dry. Or if I… move around too much, maybe? It’s hard to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I used to fix cars… for a long time. But that was… a while ago. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Pavlovic. Though “more when it’s dry” isn’t terribly specific. Do you notice it worse at night, or in the morning?
PATIENT: Oh… night, I think. Yes, at night, when I’m layin’ down. It feels… deeper then, maybe? Hard to explain. I don’t sleep as good when it’s botherin’ me. It wakes me up sometimes. But mornings… not so much. Just kinda… there, if I think about it. I don’t usually pay it much mind ‘til it starts up at night.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not that I recall. No fever, no… stuffiness. I get a little tired, but I’m ninety years old! So, that’s probably just… bein’ old. I don't really get sick much, never have. Just this cough… and the forgetfulness, of course. But that's been happenin’ for years.
DOCTOR: Right. No fever, no congestion… Just the cough and… the expected effects of age. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Well, I don't run marathons anymore, if that’s what you mean. I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, maybe? But I always figured that was just… bein’ old. I haven’t really done much lately, to be honest. Mostly just sit and watch TV. It’s hard to get around like I used to. I don’t know if that’s shortness of breath, or… just being tired. It's hard to tell these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no medications. Never been much for pills. Tried somethin’ for my blood pressure a long time ago, but it made me feel awful, so I stopped. Doctor told me to, actually. Said it wasn’t worth it. Been off everything for… goodness, I don’t even remember how long. Just try to take it easy, that’s what I do. And drink plenty of water. Well, when I remember to.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels, if you don’t mind. Just a quick examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. Just tell me what to do. I used to be good with machines, you know. Maybe I can help… no, no, I’m just teasin’. Do what you need to do. My lungs… they probably haven't been used much lately.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit up here for me, please. Hmm. There's some diminished breath sound here on the right side. And a few scattered crackles. Your oxygen is… 92%. That's a little low, but not critically so. Do you have any history of pneumonia or other lung infections?
PATIENT: Pneumonia…? Oh, goodness… I don’t remember. I’ve been sick a few times, of course, when I was younger. But pneumonia… I don’t think so. I might have had it when I was a kid, but I honestly can’t say. My wife… she used to keep track of all that. But she’s gone now… a long time ago. I just… I don’t really remember. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your age, the diminished breath sounds, and the crackles, I suspect we’re dealing with a bit of bronchitis, possibly with some mild pneumonia. It's not severe at this stage, but we need to address it. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to confirm, and I'll prescribe a short course of antibiotics, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… Oh… are those strong? I really don't like takin' pills, Doctor. And an X-ray…? Is that safe? I’ve heard… well, I’ve heard things. My wife always said I worry too much. But it’s hard not to, you know? I just… I don’t want anything complicated. Can’t we just… try some rest? And drink more water? Maybe it’ll go away on its own?
DOCTOR: Mr. Pavlovic, at your age, even a mild infection can quickly become serious. The antibiotics are standard, and the X-ray exposure is minimal—far less than you encounter from, say, a cross-country flight. I understand your concerns, but we need to rule out pneumonia, and the antibiotics will help prevent it from worsening. It’s a precaution, not something to be feared. I'll write you a prescription for a five-day course. And I'm sending you to the radiology department for the X-ray immediately. Do you have someone who can take you?
PATIENT: Oh… I… I don’t. My son lives far away. He's busy with his family. I usually take the bus… but I don't think I can manage that today. Especially with an X-ray and pills to worry about. I… I don't know what to do. Is there anyone… could someone help me? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Pavlovic, I understand this is a lot. The clinic has a social worker who can assist with transportation. I'll have her come speak with you after this consultation. In the meantime, let me call radiology and see if they have any assistance programs for patients without transportation. Don’t worry, we'll figure something out. Let me just see… Hello?
PATIENT: Oh… that would be wonderful, Doctor. Truly wonderful. Thank you. I… I really appreciate it. It’s just… I get so flustered sometimes. It's hard to keep track of everything these days. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pavlovic, 90 years old… Yes, no transportation… Alright, thank you so much. Okay, radiology has a volunteer service that can pick you up and bring you back. They’ll be here within the hour. The social worker, Ms. Chen, will be in to speak with you shortly to discuss any other concerns you may have. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think… I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for helpin’ me with the transportation. It means a lot. I guess I’ll just wait for Ms. Chen then.
