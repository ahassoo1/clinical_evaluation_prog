DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Noordin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom, yes. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But… well, there was blood. In the stool. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes, I can understand that. Blood in the stool is always worth investigating, regardless of the amount. Alright. And how long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Not long, really. Maybe… three, four times now? Over the past week, perhaps. It’s not every time, thankfully. And it wasn’t… bright red, if that makes a difference. More… darker. Like coffee grounds, almost. Though I haven’t been drinking much coffee lately, truth be told. Bad for the nerves, you know.
DOCTOR: Darker blood, like coffee grounds… alright, that is helpful information. And you said it’s not happening every time you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Most times it’s… normal. Perfectly normal. It's just… a few times, this darker stuff. And honestly, it’s probably nothing. I’ve always had a… sensitive constitution. My mother always said so. Though she also said I wouldn’t last a week flying those planes, and look at me now – 88 years old! Still kicking. But still... a man worries, you know? Especially about things coming out the wrong end.
DOCTOR: Well, “sensitive constitution” doesn't rule out everything, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good you're here to get it checked out. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I’m not one for dwelling on… bodily functions. It goes in, it comes out. That’s how it works. But… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. But at my age, everything is usual. And my stomach has been a bit… rumbley. Like it’s empty when it isn't. Is that important? Honestly, I'm not sure what is important these days. Everything feels a bit… off. But I could just be getting old. That’s the most likely explanation, wouldn’t you say?
DOCTOR: It could be getting older, yes. But fatigue and changes in bowel habits, even with a bit of rumbling… those things warrant investigation. Have you had any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More of a… discomfort. A sort of ache, low down. Comes and goes. And it's not sharp, you understand. Dull. Like a… a persistent annoyance, really. Not enough to stop me, mind you. I still manage my usual walks, and I've been tinkering with the old radio. But it’s there. Just a nagging feeling. Honestly, I don't usually pay it much attention. I’ve always been able to push through things. It’s what it takes to get ahead in life. Though what ‘ahead’ even means at this point, I couldn’t tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like we have a few things to look into. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, and then I'd like to order some blood work and a stool test. The stool test is important to check for any blood or infection. We also need to rule out anything more serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… a stool test. Honestly. All this fuss over a bit of… discoloration. But… alright. If you insist. I suppose it’s best to be thorough. Though I still maintain it’s probably just old age catching up with me. But do what you have to do, Doctor. Just… try not to take too much blood, alright? I’ve never been fond of needles. And as for the… sample, well, let’s just get it over with quickly, shall we? The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to more important things. Like listening to the BBC World Service. Do you have any idea what’s happening in the Falklands these days?
DOCTOR: We’ll only take what’s necessary, Mr. Rowbottom. And I’ll be as quick as possible. As for the Falklands… I’m afraid my expertise lies more in internal affairs, not international politics. Let’s focus on getting you checked out first. If you could just follow me to the exam room, we’ll get started. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen, then I'll need to do a quick digital rectal exam – it’s standard procedure when we’re investigating these sorts of symptoms.
PATIENT: Digital… what now? Look, Doctor, I’m not entirely comfortable with… poking and prodding. Is that absolutely necessary? Surely there’s another way to determine if I’m simply… worn out. I mean, I've lived a full life, flown countless hours, weathered storms… can’t you just tell by looking at me? This feels… intrusive. And frankly, undignified. Perhaps the blood work is enough? I’m a bit sensitive down there, you understand. Always have been. A touch of… fragility. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, I understand your discomfort, but a digital rectal exam is a critical part of evaluating your symptoms. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, like polyps or masses, that could be causing the bleeding. Blood work gives us a lot of information, but it doesn't tell the whole story. I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn't medically necessary. We can make it as comfortable as possible, but skipping it would be irresponsible. If you're truly concerned, we can discuss a referral to a specialist who can explain the procedure in more detail, but I strongly advise against delaying further investigation. It's better to be thorough now than to miss something important. I need to proceed with the exam. Do you understand?
