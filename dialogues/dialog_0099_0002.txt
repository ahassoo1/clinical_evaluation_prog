DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen, good to see you. Though, frankly, at your age, a visit shouldn't be too taxing, should it?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Taxing… yes, things are tiring these days. But not too bad, not too bad. I just… well, my water. It’s hard to… get it all out, you know? Like it's stuck.
DOCTOR: Stuck, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not completely stuck, mind you. It comes… just not all at once. And it takes a while. Longer than it used to, definitely. It’s a bit… embarrassing, to be honest. My husband, he doesn't mind, but… it's just not nice.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing is a strong word, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s a natural function, after all. But I understand your discomfort. So, you’re saying it takes longer to empty your bladder, and the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Stream… yes, that's a good word. Not strong. Like a little trickle. And I have to… push a bit, sometimes. Not always, but often. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness. A while now. Months, I think? Maybe longer. It's hard to remember exactly. Everything feels like a long time these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Months. Okay. And have you noticed any… urgency?
PATIENT: Urgency? What do you mean by that, Doctor? Do you mean like… needing to go right away? Sometimes, yes. Especially if I drink a lot of tea. But not always. It's… hard to explain. Sometimes I feel like I should go, but when I try, nothing happens right away. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not good at talking about these things. It feels silly.
DOCTOR: It doesn't make sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit awkward discussing this. You’re describing a bit of hesitancy, a delayed start, and sometimes the feeling of incomplete emptying. Now, let’s just cover a few things. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Burning… no. It's not uncomfortable exactly. Just… frustrating. Like it's working too hard. And cold, sometimes. A cold feeling afterward, but not pain, no. It’s just… not how it used to be. Everything aches a bit these days, but this is… different. I don't know if that makes sense. It's like a weak muscle. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: A weak muscle... that's a useful way to put it, actually. No fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. Chills… sometimes I feel a bit cold, but that's just the house, you know? It gets drafty. And my belly… no, no pain there. Just the usual old lady aches, if you know what I mean. Everything creaks and groans a bit, but not… a sharp pain. No, definitely no sharp pain. Just this… trouble with my water. It's been worrying me a bit, to be honest. My sister, she had trouble with her kidneys once, and… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Let's not jump to conclusions about kidneys just yet. Your sister's situation may not be relevant. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. Just the usual. For my blood pressure, a little white pill. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take something for that, but not every day. I forget the names, Doctor. My daughter handles most of that now. And allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing serious. I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Except maybe rude people, but that's not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure medication... can you recall the name, even approximately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s the tricky part, isn’t it? It's… a small white pill. That’s all I really know. My daughter… she orders it for me. I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? It’s… frustrating, I know. I used to be good with remembering things. But these days… it all just blurs together. I really wish I could be more helpful. I feel like a silly old woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can look this up. Now, before we proceed, Ms. Stoffregen, I'm going to need to perform a quick physical exam. That will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief neurological check. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A check? Yes, yes, that’s fine. I suppose so. Listening… and a what? Neurological… is that looking at my brain? Don't worry, I haven’t gone completely senile yet! But yes, go ahead. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please lie down on your back on the examination table. And yes, just a standard check to ensure everything is functioning as it should. It will be quick.
PATIENT: Alright. A little creaky getting up here, Doctor. But I managed. Go ahead when you're ready. I'll try to stay still. Though I can't promise much, my joints aren't very cooperative these days!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… a bit of pressure, you know? Like when you press on a soft tummy. Nothing painful. It's just… well, my tummy is a bit soft these days. I haven't been eating as much. But no pain, no. Are you finding anything? It feels a little strange having someone poke at me, Doctor, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, I'm going to ask you to perform a simple test. Could you please cross your legs and bear down, as if you are trying to urinate?
PATIENT: Bear down? Like… push? Oh dear. I haven’t done that in a long time. Is that right? Like this? It feels a bit silly. I'm not very good at this anymore. It's just… hard. Does that help? Are you seeing something?
DOCTOR: There’s minimal leakage, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, I would like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume check. That will help us determine how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it.
PATIENT: A what-alysis? And a… volume check? Oh dear. Does that involve more poking? And… does it hurt? I don’t like needles, Doctor. Not at all. I had a bad experience when I was a little girl… I just… I hope it won't be too unpleasant. What exactly do you need to do? And how long will it take? I have a tea date with my friend Matilda this afternoon, you see…
DOCTOR: The urinalysis involves a simple urine sample, Ms. Stoffregen. You'll simply provide a sample in a cup. As for the post-void residual volume, it involves a non-invasive ultrasound, a painless scan of your bladder after you urinate to see how much is left. It won't involve any needles. We can get the ultrasound done right here in the clinic. It should take approximately 30 minutes total. I understand you have a tea date, and we will do our best to expedite the process.
PATIENT: Oh. A cup? And a scan? No needles? That… that sounds much better. A scan is alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Thirty minutes, you say? Yes, that should be alright. I can tell Matilda I’m a little late. Do I need to drink anything beforehand? Or… should I empty my bladder now? I don’t want to make a mess, you see. I’m a bit shaky these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, please empty your bladder now as completely as you can. The scan is most accurate with an empty bladder. No need to rush, take your time. We’ll start with the urinalysis immediately afterward. I'll have my assistant bring you a collection cup and instructions. Is there anything else I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind. No, I don’t think so. Just… maybe a little help getting off this table afterward? It’s a bit high, and my knees aren’t what they used to be. But other than that, I think I’m alright. Just let me know when you're ready. I suppose this is all part of getting old, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indeed, Ms. Stoffregen. We will assist you off the table. Just take your time. We'll get everything sorted out. My assistant, Emily, will be in shortly with the necessary materials.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I hope this Emily is a nice girl. I really do hope it’s nothing serious. Tea with Matilda is very important, you know. .
