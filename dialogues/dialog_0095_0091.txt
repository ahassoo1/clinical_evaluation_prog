DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just... I been drinking a lot more water than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. Is very strange, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, drinking more water and increased hunger… that is something we should look into. And you said this is a recent change?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is not like how I normally be. Maybe the last couple of months, things start to feel different. Not suddenly, you know? Slow, slow, is how it come on. I thought maybe is the heat, but even when is cooler, I still feel so thirsty.
DOCTOR: Alright, a gradual onset over the last couple of months. And you've noticed the increased thirst even on cooler days. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – needing to go more often, or any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I have been going to the bathroom more, yes. I thought is just because I drinking more water. And the color…is look normal, I think. Not dark or anything. Is hard to say for sure, Doctor. I don't really pay attention to that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased urination along with the increased thirst and hunger. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Weight loss…now that you mention it…my clothes have been feeling a little loose, yes. But I thought is just because…well, I not as active as I used to be. Is not like I trying to lose weight or anything, you know? Is just…happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased thirst, increased urination, increased hunger, and unintentional weight loss… These are things we need to investigate further. Do you have any family history of diabetes, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Diabetes… Hmm. My mother’s sister, Auntie Elsie, she had the sugar, yes. She had to take injections. Is long time ago though, Doctor. Maybe twenty years or more. I not sure if my mother had it. She gone now, so I can’t really remember. Is a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes is important to know. And you mentioned your aunt had to take injections. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of – high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little problem with my pressure sometimes, yes. The doctor told me is high, but he give me some pills to take. I take them when I remember, not every day. And my back does bother me sometimes, is from the work, I think. Lifting the pumps is heavy work, you know? Apart from that, I not really sick much. Mostly just little aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you manage with medication as needed, and some back pain. Do you take any other medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the pressure pills, Doctor. And sometimes I take something for the back pain, when is very bad. Is just ibuprofen, you know, the regular kind. Nothing else. I not really one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer just to rest and put a hot compress on it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I not allergic to anything that I know of. I eat everything. I not picky. Never had a problem with any foods or anything like that. I never had to go to the hospital for allergies or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, Ms. Zicarelli, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'd also like to check your feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. You can check whatever you need to. I trust your judgement. Is good you looking into this, because is worrying me a little bit, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your feet. I’m checking your sensation in your feet… everything seems intact. Circulation feels a little diminished in your lower extremities, but not drastically so. I’m also noting some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you normally have swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. Sometimes, yes. I thought is just from standing all day at work. Is hard work, you know, being on my feet for so long. But is not always there. Sometimes is fine, sometimes is a little puffy. I not sure if is normal or not, to be honest. I never really told the doctor about it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, some intermittent swelling in the ankles. Based on your symptoms – increased thirst, increased urination, increased hunger, unintentional weight loss, family history of diabetes, elevated blood pressure, and mild swelling in your ankles – I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. It would also be helpful to get a urine sample to check for sugar and protein. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever you think is best. Is good you doing these tests, to find out what is going on. I want to know for sure, you know? I not wanting to be sick. So yes, please do all the tests you need. How do I give you the sample?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll have the nurse bring you a container for the urine sample. You'll need to collect a mid-stream sample – that means you'll start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream into the container. And try to get it to the lab as soon as possible. The nurse will also draw some blood for the other tests. This should give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll have the results sent to me, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I will do as you say. I will try my best to get the sample quickly. And I will wait for you to call me. Thank you very much for taking the time to listen to me and looking into this. I feel a little better already, knowing you are helping.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m glad I could help, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork for the blood work and urine sample. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thank you again. I will. Have a good day too. .
