DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well… it’s about getting a decent night’s sleep, really. And, I suppose, feeling a bit less… floppy. Not that I’m unfit, you understand. I just… don’t bounce back like I used to. It's been… a while since things were good, to be honest. Though, specifics? Honestly, they’re a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A bit hazy,” I understand. Let’s try to get a little more specific then. When you say “things were good,” about how long ago was that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… before… everything. It was… warmer. Definitely warmer. And… there was a lot more… music, I think? Before my wife… passed. So, probably… five, maybe six years ago? It's all a bit of a blur, really. I just know I wasn't waking up feeling like I’d wrestled a bear every morning. Does that make sense? I used to be able to work all day, tuning pianos and fiddling with guitars… now? It’s a struggle. Not that I’m complaining too much. One gets used to things.
DOCTOR: Okay, five or six years ago, and a noticeable change since then, coinciding with the loss of your wife. I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Redfern. That's a significant life event. So, currently, what does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Right, well… I get up. Eventually. Usually after a few tries with the alarm. I run my little shop, mostly fixing stringed instruments. Pianos are… less frequent these days. Too much bending, you see. Then I have a bit of lunch, usually something simple. And then… more work, until I’m too tired to see straight. I try to keep it going, you know? Can't just sit around. It’s… a waste. Evenings are pretty quiet. I might listen to some music… or just… sit. Honestly, it's all a bit monotonous. It’s not a bad life, just… not very energetic. I used to go out more, but… what's the point? It's not like I'm going to meet anyone. I mean, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly solitary routine, primarily focused on your work, and a decreased level of social activity. You mentioned feeling less energetic. Can you describe that fatigue?
PATIENT: It’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up, Doctor. It's more… a constant drag. Like wading through treacle. I can do things, I force myself to, but it takes a lot of effort. And afterwards… I’m just wiped. And it's not just physical, you understand. It’s… mental, too. Can't really concentrate for long periods. I find myself staring at things, forgetting what I was doing. It’s… irritating, to be honest. And the sleep doesn’t really help. I get enough hours, I think. Maybe seven, eight. But it's not restful. I wake up feeling… unrefreshed. Like I haven’t slept at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant fatigue, both physical and mental, difficulty concentrating, and non-restorative sleep despite adequate hours. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Appetite… not really. I eat when I remember to, which isn't always as frequently as I should, I suppose. I’m not a big eater to begin with. And weight… probably a bit less. Nothing drastic, mind you. I’m a tall fellow, always been lean. Maybe… five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say. I haven’t really been keeping track. It’s not like I’m worried about it. I just… don’t have much of an appetite for life these days, I guess. It probably shows.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms, such as muscle aches, headaches, changes in bowel habits, or any feelings of sadness or hopelessness?
PATIENT: Muscle aches… sometimes. Mostly in my back, from bending over instruments all day. Nothing serious. I just rub some cream on it. Headaches, occasionally. Stress, probably. Bowel habits… regular enough. Nothing to report there. Sadness… well. That’s a bit of a loaded question, isn’t it? Look, losing my wife was… devastating. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I get… moments. Quiet moments. But I don’t sit around weeping all day. I’m a practical man. Hopelessness… no. I don’t feel hopeless. Just… tired. And… resigned, perhaps. It is what it is, you know? I just want to feel… less like an old engine struggling to turn over. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Let's take a look at your medical history then. Do you have a list of any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… just some over-the-counter pain relievers for the back, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, I think. Nothing regular. And allergies… not that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty simple case. I don't go to doctors much. Always been healthy, up until… well, you know. I have Medicare, of course. But I try to avoid using it if I can. It's a waste of everyone's time, really. Though, I suppose, I’m here now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, no known allergies. Just ibuprofen as needed. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief neurological assessment. It’ll just be a quick look to get a better picture of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it can't hurt. Though, I warn you, my blood pressure might be a little high. I get a bit… agitated when people fuss over me. Not that you're fussing, exactly. Just… I’m not used to this sort of attention. Go ahead. Just try to be quick, if you don't mind. I have a piano to tune later this afternoon. A rather temperamental Steinway, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Reflexes are normal, motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious neurological deficits noted. Do you experience any dizziness when standing up quickly?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. Not often, mind you. Just a little lightheadedness. I usually chalk it up to getting old. Or not eating enough. I don’t think much of it. It passes quickly enough. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit of a worrier when it comes to my health. I’d rather just get on with things, if you know what I mean. Is this all going to involve a lot of tests? I really don't have the patience for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about tests, Mr. Redfern. I think we can start with some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues that could be contributing to your fatigue. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It’ll give us a good baseline. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh, alright. If you must. But I warn you, I’m not very good with needles. Always been a bit squeamish. And I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary… fine. Just try to be quick about it, alright? And tell me if it’s going to hurt. I’d rather be prepared. Where do I go? And how long will it take? I really do have that Steinway to tune this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Redfern. We'll get this done as quickly and comfortably as possible. There's a lab just down the hall, Room 3. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, including paperwork. They're very efficient. I'll send the order electronically, so just let the lab technician know your name and date of birth. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get some rest if you can. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Room 3, fifteen minutes. Hydrate. Rest. I can manage that. Honestly, Doctor, you’ve been… surprisingly efficient, all things considered. I was expecting a lot more fuss. Just… don’t expect miracles, alright? I’m a bit of a lost cause, if I’m honest. But thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a Steinway to wrestle with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. We’ll see what the results say. Don’t underestimate yourself. And I hope you enjoy wrestling with that Steinway. If you need anything, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. You too. Enjoy your afternoon as well. And… don’t bother calling if the results are bad. I’m a practical man.
