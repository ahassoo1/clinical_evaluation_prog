DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Skarbek, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning, Doctor. It’s about getting some shots. My grandson… he’s trying to get his papers straightened out to come live here with me. He's from over seas, and I believe he needs some vaccinations before he can get his visa. I just want to make sure he has everything he needs, you see.
DOCTOR: Vaccinations… Yes, alright. A common enough request. Do you have any record of his previous vaccinations?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don’t. He grew up… well, a long ways away. They don’t really keep those kinds of records the same way we do here. It’s a bit… different over there. I was hoping you could tell me what he’d need, and maybe we could get him started?
DOCTOR: "Different" isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Skarbek. We need something to work with. However... alright. In the absence of records, we'll have to assume he’s completely unimmunized. That means a fairly comprehensive series. We’ll need to check his age, of course, to determine the appropriate schedule. How old is your grandson, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, pardon me, Doctor. You’re right, that was a poor way to put it. He turned 16 just last month. Sixteen years old, as of July. I get a little flustered sometimes, trying to remember everything. It’s been a long process getting him here, even just starting the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Sixteen. Right. That simplifies things somewhat. He'll need a Tdap booster, certainly. And influenza, given the season. We should also check his varicella status – chickenpox vaccine. And I would recommend the HPV vaccine. It’s generally given starting at 11 or 12, but it can still be effective up to age 26. Do you have any objections to that one?
PATIENT: HPV vaccine…? I… I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that one. What does it protect against? Is that something he needs to come here, or is it just… recommended? I want to make sure he’s healthy, of course, but I also don’t want to overwhelm him with a lot of shots all at once if it’s not absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: It protects against the human papillomavirus, which is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause…certain cancers later in life. It’s not required for the visa, no. But it's strongly recommended for all adolescents, regardless of their…future activities. We're simply trying to be proactive about his health. Look, frankly, I don’t have time to debate the merits of every vaccine. It’s a standard of care. Do you want me to proceed with the recommended series, or not?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… a lot to take in. I hadn't even considered anything like that. And he's just a boy, you know? I… I don’t think I’m comfortable with that one right now. Not until I’ve had a chance to talk it over with him, and maybe do some reading myself. But the others… the ones you said he needs… the flu and the chickenpox… and the Tdap, was it…? Yes, let’s start with those, please. If you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Tdap, influenza, and varicella. We’ll need to check if he’s had chickenpox previously. Have you ever known him to have had it?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't think so. He lived with his mother his whole life, and she never mentioned anything about him having the chickenpox. He's a pretty healthy boy, always has been, but I don't recall him ever being sick with that. So, I suppose he hasn't. Does that mean we need a blood test to find out? I'm just trying to understand the process.
DOCTOR: A blood test would be… excessive. We can simply proceed with the vaccine. If he has had chickenpox, he’ll simply develop no reaction. It’s a minimal risk. Look, I have other patients waiting. Let’s just get this done, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. If you think that's best. I just want to do what's right for him, you see. I don’t want to cause him any unnecessary trouble. So, the shots… are they all in one arm? Or…? I’m a little nervous about needles, myself, to be honest. My grandson gets that from me, I think.
DOCTOR: They will be administered in separate sites, Mr. Skarbek, to minimize discomfort. One in each arm. And frankly, worrying about the needles is… unproductive. It’s a minor inconvenience. Let’s just get him in here, and we’ll have the nurse handle the injections. Do you have his insurance card ready?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, ma'am. Here it is. I apologize for all the questions. I just… I want to make sure he’s taken care of, and I don’t want to mess anything up with his visa. It’s been such a long journey, and I don't want to get stopped at the last minute over something silly.
