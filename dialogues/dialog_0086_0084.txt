DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been getting harder to breathe, I suppose. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s not… sudden, it’s just been slowly getting worse. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Slowly getting worse, you say. Alright. And when you say harder to breathe, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… like there isn’t enough air. Not a pain, exactly, just… a tightness. And I have to… focus on breathing sometimes, which isn’t normal, is it? I find myself doing that more and more often. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Kobler. A tightness, and having to consciously focus on breathing… That is concerning. Okay. And you mentioned dry mouth and eyes. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, I think. Though… maybe worse at night? It’s hard to say. I wake up with my mouth feeling like sand. And my eyes… they just feel gritty all the time, even with drops. I've been using drops, but they don’t seem to help much anymore. I’m… sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kobler. You're doing fine. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let’s try to build a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the breathing difficulties and dryness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Let me think. I… I've been more tired than usual, I suppose. Just generally… run down. And maybe a little… achy? Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache in my muscles, sometimes. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m forgetting things, too, but… that’s always been a bit of a problem for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue and muscle aches… and you mentioned some memory issues. Do these symptoms seem to correlate with the breathing or dryness, or are they fairly independent?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I think… they feel connected. When I’m really struggling to breathe, I feel worse – more tired, more achy. And the dryness… it just adds to the overall feeling of being unwell. I’m not sure if that makes any sense. It's all a bit… muddled, to be honest. I don’t remember things clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, "muddled" is a useful word, Ms. Kobler. It helps me understand. Let's move on to some basic questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any fever, cough, or chest pain at any point?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And I haven’t had a cough. No chest pain either. It’s… just the shortness of breath and the dryness. I haven’t been sick, not in the usual way. It’s just… this feeling of not being able to get enough air. That’s the main thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? I… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. Let me see… No, I don’t think so. They seem normal. I don't usually wear shoes that would hide swelling. I mostly wear sandals.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like asthma, heart problems, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… Hmm. I was… divorced a few years back, does that count? Oh, sorry. No, I don't think so. I’ve never been told I have anything chronic. I haven’t been to the doctor much, honestly. Just for check-ups, usually. Nothing serious. I… I don't remember ever being diagnosed with anything like asthma or heart problems.
DOCTOR: Right. No significant medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… no hospitalizations, not that I recall. I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. And it wasn’t… serious. Just a cast for a few weeks. I'm really trying to think, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize. It's frustrating for both of us, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kobler. We'll work through it. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of heart disease, lung problems, autoimmune diseases, or anything else significant in your family?
PATIENT: My family… That’s… difficult. I didn’t grow up with my parents. I was raised by my grandmother. She… she wasn't very talkative. I don’t really know much about her side of the family. And… I never met my father's family. So… I don’t know. I don’t know if there’s any history of anything, to be honest. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's a bit of a blank, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's… understandable. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. And I rarely drink alcohol. Just… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very occasionally. And definitely no recreational drugs. I… I don't approve of those things. I live a pretty quiet life, mostly. I enjoy writing. It keeps me occupied.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I'm not fond of shellfish, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy. No medication allergies, to my knowledge. No… bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Though I don't feel very lucky right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… it’s nice to finally be talking to someone about this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, Ms. Kobler… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Okay. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Deep breath… and exhale. Your breathing sounds… slightly diminished bilaterally. Not dramatically, but noticeable. And your heart rate is a little elevated. Blood pressure is 135/85. Not alarming, but something to monitor. Your throat looks a little dry, but no obvious inflammation or redness. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Okay, your oxygen saturation is 94%. That’s… borderline. It should ideally be above 95%. We’ll need to run some blood work and possibly a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh. Borderline? And blood work… and an X-ray? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I'm… a little frightened, to be honest. I don’t like the sound of that. What are you looking for? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Kobler, let's not jump to conclusions. "Borderline" doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. It simply means we need more information. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. The chest X-ray will allow us to examine your lungs more closely and see if there's any evidence of congestion, fluid buildup, or other abnormalities. It won't hurt. You'll simply stand in front of a machine and hold your breath for a few seconds. It's completely painless. We’re looking for any potential causes of your shortness of breath and dryness, and these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Blood work and an X-ray. To find out what’s causing the breathing and the dryness. No pain… That’s good. But… what could it be, Doctor? Is it… my heart? Or my lungs? You said it could be fluid buildup… Is that dangerous? I apologize for asking so many questions, but… I’m just very worried. I don't usually get sick, and I don't know what to expect. It’s all a bit… overwhelming. Perhaps I should have stayed home.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kobler, while I understand your anxiety, speculating about potential diagnoses before we have any concrete evidence is unhelpful, and frankly, unproductive. It could be a number of things. It could be a mild infection, it could be allergies, it could be something more serious, but we won't know until we get the results of the tests. I assure you, we are taking this seriously, and we will do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide you with the appropriate treatment. Now, I’m going to have my nurse draw some blood. Then, we’ll schedule a chest X-ray for you. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… the blood work and the X-ray. And then… we wait. Alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. And… thank you for listening. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results. It's just… a little frightening, being uncertain.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure to you. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Worsening symptoms… emergency room. I’ll remember that. Thank you again. I… I think I’ll just wait here, then. Until the nurse comes. Have a good day, Doctor.
