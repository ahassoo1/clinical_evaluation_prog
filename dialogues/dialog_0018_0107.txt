DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like... it goes too fast, then normal, then fast again. It's been happening for... maybe a month now? Not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. A sensation of a rapid or irregular heartbeat can certainly be concerning. Approximately a month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. About a month. Maybe a little longer. It doesn't hurt, just... feels like it's jumping around. Sometimes it happens when I'm just sitting, sometimes when I walk a little faster. Not when I'm working, though. Work is pretty slow pace. I operate machines, you know? Not running around.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that. It’s helpful to know it's not associated with exertion at work. And you've noticed it both at rest and with minimal activity, like walking?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. When I'm relaxing at home, watching TV... sometimes then. And if I walk to the store, not running, just walking normal... sometimes it starts. It doesn't last long, maybe a few minutes, then stops. It just... feels bad when it happens. Makes me a little worried. My wife, she tells me to come see a doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in, and you’re right to get it checked out. A few minutes at a time, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few minutes. Maybe five, maybe ten. Not longer than that, I don’t think. And it's not always happening, like I said. Some days, nothing. Other days, maybe once or twice. It's hard to say when it will happen. It doesn't make me feel sick, just... uncomfortable. Like a flapping bird inside my chest, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very helpful description, Mr. Puder. "Flapping bird" – I understand. So, intermittent episodes lasting a few minutes, occurring both at rest and with mild exertion, without other accompanying symptoms like nausea, dizziness, or shortness of breath. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history... hmm. Not much, I think. I haven't been to a doctor in... a long time. Maybe five years? Just for a check-up. I don't have any big problems, usually. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. I don't take any medicine. I eat okay, I guess. My wife cooks. I don't smoke, I don't drink much. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. No chronic medical conditions, no current medications, and a healthy lifestyle – that’s excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And no hospital... except when my son was born, but that was just for a day. Nothing serious for me. I just... got a little tired. My wife did all the work, really. She's a strong woman. I just helped carry things. No problems, never had to stay in the hospital for anything myself.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family... hmm. My father, he had some heart trouble when he was old, I think. But he lived a long life, almost eighty. My mother, she was okay, no big problems. My brother, he's healthy too, as far as I know. No one that I know of had... this problem with their heart beating fast. Just my father, and that was when he was very old. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A history of heart trouble in your father, but later in life. No similar issues in your mother or brother. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... no. I don’t think so. I can eat anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to food or medicine. Sometimes dust makes me sneeze, but that's all. Not a real allergy, just... dust. I've never been stung by a bee or anything like that, so I don't know about those. Nothing serious, I promise. I'm a pretty simple man, not much trouble with allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Puder. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I would like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. My wife said I should come, and she's usually right. I'll just sit here and relax, right? You just listen to my heart and... feel my pulse? Okay, that sounds good. Let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please try to breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular at rest, although I do note a slightly elevated heart rate – 92 beats per minute. Your lungs are clear. Your pulse is also regular, but a bit fast at 88 in both wrists. Blood pressure is 130/80. I'm also going to take your temperature. Temperature is normal. Now, while you're lying down, I'm going to palpate your abdomen to check for any abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm lying down. Whatever you need to do. My stomach is okay, I think. I eat a lot, but that's normal. Sometimes a little gas, but that's it. Nothing serious. You just feel my stomach? Is that right? And then what? Do you need to do more tests? I'm a little worried about tests. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities detected. You're right to ask about further testing, Mr. Puder. Given your symptoms – intermittent palpitations, slightly elevated heart rate, and family history – I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or ECG. This is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll also do a blood test to check your thyroid levels and rule out any electrolyte imbalances. The blood test will require a small needle, but it’s a very common procedure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An ECG... and blood tests. Okay. The ECG sounds okay, if it doesn't hurt. But the blood tests... I really don't like needles. Is it a big needle? And will it hurt a lot? I get nervous easily. My wife says I worry too much. But I don't like needles. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe just watch me for a while? See if it happens again?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Puder. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. The needle we use for the blood test is quite small – a very fine gauge. And the discomfort is usually minimal – a quick pinch, lasting only a few seconds. We're very skilled at drawing blood, and we take every precaution to minimize discomfort. We could observe you for a while, as you suggest, and see if we can capture an episode of the palpitations on an ECG while it’s happening. However, that’s not always reliable. The episode might not occur while you’re here, and it could delay getting a diagnosis. Alternatively, we could start with the ECG and blood tests, and if you find it particularly distressing, we can discuss other options. I want you to feel comfortable and confident in our approach. We can also use numbing cream prior to the blood draw to help minimize discomfort. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm... numbing cream? That sounds good. Maybe that would help. And just a small needle? I don't want a big, scary needle. My wife said I should get it done, so I guess I should. But I'm still nervous. Can you be very gentle? And tell me when you're going to do it? I don't like surprises. And... can my wife be with me when you do the blood test? Just to hold my hand? That would help a lot. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Puder. That's perfectly fine. We can absolutely use the numbing cream, and I assure you, it’s a very small needle. I will explain every step of the procedure to you beforehand, and I will be very gentle. You can absolutely have your wife with you to hold your hand – that’s a wonderful idea and will likely help you feel more comfortable. I will order the ECG and blood tests, and we’ll prepare the numbing cream. We’ll call your wife in to join you shortly. We'll get you comfortable and take things at your pace. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds... much better. Yes, much better. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I feel a little less worried now. Just a small needle, and my wife can hold my hand... that's good. Okay. Let's do it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could ease your concerns. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to start the preparations. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
