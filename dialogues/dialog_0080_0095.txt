DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have time for pleasantries. It's my ear. It just…stopped working. On one side. And my face feels a bit droopy, though I'm sure it's nothing. I woke up like this this morning. It's incredibly inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about your ear and facial drooping. “Inconvenient” is a good way to put it, and it’s good you came in right away. That's definitely something we need to take a look at. Just to clarify, it happened suddenly overnight?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. I went to bed perfectly fine. Woke up…this. It's not like it was gradual or anything. I don't understand why you need to know every detail. It just happened. It's…frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. Sudden onset is important information, and helps me narrow down what might be going on. Okay, so no pain with this at all?
PATIENT: No pain. Absolutely none. Just…silence on one side and this…pulling feeling. Honestly, I'm more concerned about how I look. Do I look terribly lopsided? I have a luncheon tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain is good to know. We’ll get to the appearance question in a moment. First, let’s get a little more information. Have you experienced any dizziness, weakness, or trouble with your balance since this started?
PATIENT: Balance? No. I haven’t fallen or anything. Weakness…well, I feel a bit weak from the stress of this whole situation, if that counts. But physically? No. Look, is this going to be a long process? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dizziness or weakness aside from stress. Alright. It’s important to rule out anything serious, so I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your ears, look at your facial muscles, and do a quick neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long, but it’s crucial. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. But be gentle, please. I do not want this to make things worse. And try to be quick about it. Honestly, the waiting room was…less than ideal.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. I’m just going to take a look in your ears first. Okay, your ear canals look clear. Now, I’m going to check your facial muscles. Could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It feels…odd, doesn’t it? Like one side isn't cooperating. This is ridiculous. I have a reputation to uphold, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, could you please close your eyes as tightly as you can and try to raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Like this. Is that good enough? It feels…strained. I'm not a contortionist, you know. Honestly, this is all very unsettling. I’m usually quite composed.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And now, could you stick your tongue out for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that what you wanted? It feels…strange. Are you writing all this down? It's probably nothing, you know. Probably just a…nerve thing. I read something online once.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down. It’s important to document everything carefully. And you're right to think about a nerve, but we need to be thorough. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, the most concerning possibility is something called Bell’s Palsy. It's a paralysis of the facial nerve, often sudden onset, and can cause the symptoms you’re describing. However, we need to rule out other, more serious causes. I'm going to order a blood test to check for things like stroke and infection. I'd also like to get an MRI of your brain, just to be absolutely sure. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? This is getting out of hand. I told you, it's probably just a nerve. I don't need a whole battery of tests. Contrast dye… I… I think I might be allergic, yes. My sister had a bad reaction once. It was…unpleasant. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite faint. This is too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important to know about the allergy. We can do the MRI without contrast, it will just give us slightly less detail. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed, and I apologize if this is a lot to take in. But given the sudden onset of your symptoms, it’s crucial we rule out anything serious like a stroke. I'm going to order the blood tests right away and schedule the MRI as soon as possible. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe a course of steroids to help reduce inflammation and hopefully improve your chances of recovery. Do you have any other medical conditions or medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Steroids? Really? I don't like the sound of that. Side effects, you know. I have a luncheon tomorrow, and I absolutely cannot look… puffy. I don’t take anything regularly. Nothing. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but the doctor took me off it. Honestly, this is all very inconvenient. I really must protest this course of action. I feel perfectly fine otherwise, apart from the… paralysis. And the silence. It's dreadful, really. Can't you just give me something for the…droop?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns about the steroids. We can discuss the potential side effects and weigh the risks and benefits. The goal is to reduce inflammation quickly, which is why they’re often prescribed in cases like this. While we wait for the blood tests and MRI, there isn’t a medication to directly fix the droop. We can try some eye drops to keep your eye moist on the affected side, as you may not be able to blink normally. I'll write you a prescription for that. I’m going to need you to sign a consent form for the MRI and the blood tests. And just to reiterate, even though you feel fine otherwise, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion, just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly, this is becoming ridiculous. Fine. But I'm warning you, if this interferes with my luncheon, I'll be most displeased. And I absolutely refuse to take any medication that will make me gain weight. Do you understand? I'm a public figure, you know. Appearance is… everything. Now, get on with it. I have a reputation to maintain. And I still think this is all highly unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. I'll make a note of your preference regarding weight gain with the medication. The neurologist is just for a second opinion to ensure we’ve covered all bases. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll get the MRI scheduled as soon as possible. I'm also going to give you instructions on how to protect your eye on the affected side. Here's the referral to the neurologist and the information on eye care. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough for now. Just...get it over with. And please, try to be quick. I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know. I don’t need any more stress. This whole experience has been incredibly… distressing. Honestly, I’m beginning to think I should have just ignored it. It probably would have gone away on its own. .
