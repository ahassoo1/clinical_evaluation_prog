DOCTOR: Hello, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor… Kamahele, is it? Yes, it is nice to meet you too. I… well, I've been having some trouble breathing, I suppose. It feels like it gets harder and harder to take a full breath, especially lately. And my mouth and eyes… they feel so very dry. It’s quite bothersome, actually. I don’t recall exactly when it started, though. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kamahele is correct. And please, call me Voula. That does sound quite unpleasant. Trouble breathing and dryness… alright. It’s perfectly alright if things are a little fuzzy on the timing, we’ll try to piece things together. Just tell me what you can remember. When you say it's harder to breathe, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly, Voula. Thank you. It isn't a painful feeling, not exactly. More… like I’m trying to pull air through a very small space. Like when you hold your breath for too long, and then try to take a big gulp, but it doesn't quite fill your lungs. It happens… more often when I’m resting, I think. Or maybe when I’ve been… focused on my writing. It’s difficult to say for certain. I apologize. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It's very common for things to be a bit unclear, especially with symptoms that come and go. “Like trying to pull air through a small space” – that's a very helpful description. And it being worse with rest or focused activity is good information too. Now, you mentioned it happens when you're writing. Do you spend a lot of time indoors when you write?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Quite a lot, actually. My work… it requires a great deal of concentration, and I find it best to be in a quiet place. My home office is rather… secluded. Not much fresh air gets in there, I suppose. Though I do open the windows when I remember. It’s… a bit of a habit to get lost in my thoughts, and forget about such things. I'm divorced, you see, and I mostly keep to myself these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, spending a lot of time indoors, possibly with not a lot of air circulation... that’s helpful to know. And thank you for sharing that about your personal life, Ms. Kobler. It helps me get a better understanding of your situation. Now, aside from the breathing trouble and dryness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… I've been… quite tired lately, I suppose. More than usual. And I’ve had a bit of a cough, now and then. It's not a productive cough, if that makes sense. Just… dry and tickly. It doesn’t bother me too much, but it’s there. Oh! And sometimes, my heart feels like it’s… fluttering. Not a painful flutter, but… noticeable. Does that sound strange? I apologize if I am rambling. It’s just… difficult to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Not rambling at all, Ms. Kobler. You’re doing just fine. Dry cough, tiredness, and the feeling of a fluttering heart… all good things to tell me. And no, it doesn't sound strange. Now, about the fluttering heart – does that happen at any particular time, or is it random?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it happens… when I’m particularly focused on my writing, and perhaps a little stressed about a deadline. It’s not a constant thing, thankfully. Just… an occasional reminder that I’m pushing myself too hard, perhaps. And sometimes, if I stand up too quickly. Though I haven’t paid too much attention to it, to be honest. It's never lasted very long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to stress or exertion. That’s good information. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Ah, yes. It says you’ve had no major illnesses or surgeries. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I am aware of. I've never had any… adverse reactions to anything, to my knowledge. I recall being stung by a bee when I was a child, but that was quite a long time ago, and I don’t believe I had a severe reaction. Just a bit of swelling, I think. Otherwise, no. No allergies that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible, if I can. I try to manage things… naturally, as much as possible. My mother… she had some rather unpleasant experiences with medications when she was older. It made me… cautious, I suppose. I prefer to rest and drink plenty of water, if I’m feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Kobler. It’s good to be mindful of your own health and preferences. Alright, well, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and take your temperature. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Voula. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed at your own pace. I… I’m not particularly fond of medical instruments, but I understand they are necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, just taking a listen to your lungs… Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Alright, and now listening to your heart… Your oxygen levels are at 94%, which is within a normal range. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not dangerously so. I’m also going to check your temperature. Everything seems to be within normal limits, Ms. Kobler, although there is some mild wheezing in your lungs. That, combined with your symptoms… I think it's likely you may be experiencing some early signs of asthma, perhaps triggered by spending time in a dry environment or stress. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Asthma… That… that’s not what I expected. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, mostly. It never occurred to me… But if that’s what you think, Doctor Kamahele, I trust your assessment. What does that mean, exactly? And what sort of… tests would be necessary to rule out other possibilities? I suppose I should ask about treatment as well, if that is the case.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be surprised, Ms. Kobler. Asthma can present differently in everyone. Given your symptoms and the wheezing I heard, it's a strong possibility, but we need to be sure. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to check for any other lung issues. We can also do a simple spirometry test—that's just a breathing test where you blow into a tube, and it measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly. It helps us see how well your lungs are functioning. If it is asthma, treatment usually involves an inhaler—a small device that delivers medication directly to your lungs. There are different types of inhalers, some for quick relief of symptoms, and others for long-term control. We can discuss those options once we have the results of the tests. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Voula. A chest X-ray and a breathing test… I can certainly manage that. And an inhaler… I suppose if that’s what’s needed, I’m willing to try it. I must admit, the thought of relying on medication isn’t particularly appealing, but if it will help me breathe easier… I do tend to worry about side effects, though. My mother… she experienced some unpleasant reactions to her arthritis medication. Perhaps you could explain some of the potential side effects of the inhaler, just so I’m prepared?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about side effects, Ms. Kobler, especially given your mother's experience. It's good you're asking questions. The most common side effects of inhalers are usually mild. With the quick-relief inhalers—the ones you use when you're having trouble breathing—you might experience some shakiness, a racing heartbeat, or a dry mouth. Those usually go away quickly. The long-term control inhalers can sometimes cause a sore throat or a fungal infection in the mouth—that's easily prevented by rinsing your mouth out with water after each use. More serious side effects are rare, but it's important to be aware of them. We’ll discuss those in detail before you start any medication, and I’ll make sure you understand how to use the inhaler correctly. For now, let's get those tests scheduled. I'll write you a referral for the chest X-ray and spirometry. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright, Voula. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel… much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. Scheduling the tests and then following up… that’s a sensible plan. I appreciate your patience and understanding, Doctor Kamahele. And thank you for listening to my… rambling concerns. I suppose there’s nothing more to do for now, then? I’ll wait for the radiology department to contact me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can, and your concerns are never rambling. No, there's nothing more to do for now. I'll also send a copy of my notes to your primary care physician, just to keep them informed. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And if your breathing gets significantly worse, or you experience any chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Kobler. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
