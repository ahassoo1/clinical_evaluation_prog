DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, my head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not all the time, but… a heavy ache, you know? Like a weight.
DOCTOR: I see. A heavy ache at the back of your head for about three days now, coming and going. Thank you for explaining that. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It's not a sharp pain, not like when I hit my thumb with a hammer. More… dull. And it feels… tight. Like a band around my head, maybe? Mostly just on the back. Sometimes it goes all the way to my eyes, a little bit. Not blurry, just… feels it there too.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, tight ache, primarily at the back of your head, and sometimes radiating forward towards your eyes. Not blurry vision, just a sensation of the pain extending there. And to confirm, it doesn't feel like a sudden, sharp, or intense pain?
PATIENT: No, not sharp. Never sharp. Always dull. And it comes and goes, like waves. Not constant, thank goodness. I can still… work, mostly. I just get tired quicker. Been doing this rail work… sixty years, you know? Lots of lifting and… moving things.
DOCTOR: Sixty years of rail work – that's remarkable, Mr. Brum. I appreciate you sharing that. The lifting and moving could certainly be a factor. When you say it comes in waves, roughly how often do these waves of pain occur?
PATIENT: Well… hard to say exactly. Maybe… three or four times a day? Sometimes more if I have to do a lot of heavy lifting. And… it's worse in the afternoon. Morning is usually okay. Like this morning. But after lunch… usually starts again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so three or four times a day, more frequent with heavy lifting, and worse in the afternoons. Have you noticed anything that relieves the pain – anything at all that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Lying down helps a little bit. Just… quiet. And… drinking water. Maybe. I always drink water when I feel it coming on. Don’t know if it helps the pain or if I just think it does. And… my wife used to rub my neck. She passed last year… but that always felt good.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. It sounds like she provided you with excellent care and comfort. So, lying down and quiet, and drinking water seem to provide some relief. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever. No dizziness. No… blurry vision, like we said. I have been… more tired, like I mentioned. And… my stomach hasn't been so good lately. Just… feels upset. Not sick, exactly, but… not right. And… sometimes my hands feel a little… numb. Not all the time. Just… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the headache, you’ve noticed increased fatigue, some stomach upset, and occasional numbness in your hands. Regarding the numbness in your hands – where specifically are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Mostly in my fingers. My pinky and ring finger, mostly. And… it's worse after I’ve been working. Like when I’m holding onto the controls. Not so bad when I'm resting. It just… tingles, like when your foot falls asleep. Not painful, just… strange.
DOCTOR: I see. Numbness and tingling in the pinky and ring finger, worsening with work and improving with rest. That's helpful information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you are aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me a long time ago, maybe ten years, but I don't take any pills for it. He said just watch my salt. And… my back. Old work injury. Been to the doctor for that a few times, years ago. Nothing serious. Just aches. Other than that… no. Never been a sick man.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you manage with diet, and an old work injury to your back. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Never needed it, thank goodness. I always tried to fix things myself, if I could. Still do, sometimes. My wife… she always said I was stubborn. But that was a long time ago, and… I mostly work with my hands now.
DOCTOR: I understand. No surgeries, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just… water. And sometimes a little bit of coffee in the morning, to wake me up. My wife always made it… strong. I miss her coffee.
DOCTOR: I understand. No medications or supplements. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had them. I can eat anything. My wife… she had a little trouble with shellfish. But I never had any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 148/85, which is a little elevated, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal. Your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Your neck is supple, and I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in all your limbs. I’m going to check your sensation now… You feel this, and this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that one too. Everything feels normal to me. A little bit numb in my fingers sometimes, like I said, but… everything else is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And your cranial nerves seem intact. I am palpating the muscles at the back of your head and neck now. Does this feel tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. Right there. That feels… tight. And a little sore. Not painful, just… uncomfortable. And a little bit on this side too. But mostly on the right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Tenderness to palpation at the base of the skull, primarily on the right side, but also present on the left. Based on your history and the physical exam, it seems you may be experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by muscle strain in your neck and upper back, and potentially related to your work history. The numbness in your fingers could be indicative of some mild nerve compression, and we will investigate that further. However, given your age and the elevated blood pressure, I would also like to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid function. I also want to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it's best. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better. And… I don’t want this to become something… serious. Blood work and… ECG, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work and an ECG. It's always best to be thorough, especially given your age and blood pressure. I'm also going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant to help with the tension in your neck and upper back. It's a low dose, and we'll see if it provides any relief. I'm also going to recommend physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises to strengthen your neck and upper back muscles, and improve your posture. We’ll get the blood work and ECG results back in a few days. I’d like to see you back here then to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I think I understand everything. Muscle relaxant and… physical therapy. And come back in a few days. That sounds good. Will the muscle relaxant… make me sleepy? My wife used to take pills for her arthritis… and they always knocked her out.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Brum. Some muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, but the one I’m prescribing is less likely to do so. However, it’s possible. If you experience any significant drowsiness, please do not drive or operate heavy machinery. I’ll also provide you with a written prescription and instructions on how to take it. Here's a referral for physical therapy, and I will have the front desk schedule you for a consultation. Do you have any difficulty with transportation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My son… he helps me with things like that. He lives nearby. He'll drive me to the physical therapy. He's a good boy. Very helpful. I don’t think I’d manage without him.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Brum. It’s good to have a supportive family. Okay, so just to recap, we’re starting with a muscle relaxant and physical therapy. We’ll get the blood work and EKG results back in a few days, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as a severe headache, fever, dizziness, or numbness, please contact my office immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you for listening to me. And… for taking your time. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye.
