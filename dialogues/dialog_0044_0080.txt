DOCTOR: Good morning, Thyra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I don’t really need anything, not like being sick. I just need some forms filled out, that’s all. Something about Medicare, I think my husband helped me set this up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Forms are a common reason for visits! I'm happy to help with those. It sounds like it might be related to getting everything settled with Medicare. Do you happen to have those forms with you, or are they something we need to retrieve?
PATIENT: I do have them! Here they are. My husband, Dale, printed them off for me. He’s good with computers. I mostly just…sign where he tells me to.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Thyra. These are the Medicare enrollment forms, it looks like. Dale sounds like a big help. No worries about signing where he directs you – it can be a bit confusing sometimes. Let's just double-check a few things to make sure everything's accurate before I finalize them. Just to confirm, your date of birth is…?
PATIENT: It’s January 12th, 1990. Does that sound right? I sometimes get my months mixed up, but I think that’s right. Dale always double-checks, too.
DOCTOR: January 12th, 1990, perfect. That matches what I have here. And just to be sure, are you currently living at [address redacted for privacy] as listed on this form?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. We’ve been there for…oh, goodness, almost ten years now. It’s a good little place, not too far from the reservation. Dale likes having a big garden there.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful! A big garden sounds lovely. It's good to have a comfortable home. Now, the form asks about your primary care physician. Do you have one listed, or would you like me to be listed as your primary care doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. We haven't really had a regular doctor since we moved here. We usually just go to the emergency room if something's really wrong. Could you be my primary care doctor, if that’s okay? Dale would like that, I think. Having someone we could actually see regularly would be good.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Thyra. I'd be happy to be your primary care physician. That's a great idea to establish regular care. We can schedule follow-up appointments to check in and address anything that comes up, rather than waiting for emergencies. Now, just a standard question for all new patients… do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I don’t think so. I’m not allergic to anything I know of. Dale always asks when I go to the hospital, and they haven’t ever written anything down. Maybe I’m a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, makes me sneeze, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Pollen sensitivity doesn't usually need to be listed as a medical allergy, no. It’s good to know though! So, no known drug or food allergies. Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. Dale says we need it, especially in the winter. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back, if it’s really bothering me. That’s about it, I think. Nothing regular, just as needed. Oh! And Dale gives me fish oil pills sometimes, says it’s good for my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed for your back, and fish oil pills. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a bit of a broader picture, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your general health history?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, go ahead. I don’t mind. I’m pretty healthy, I think, for my age. Dale always makes sure I eat right and get some exercise. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: He sounds wonderful, Thyra. That’s fantastic. Alright, let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had pneumonia when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a tree. But nothing serious, nothing I still deal with. The doctors always said I was a pretty healthy baby. That’s what my grandma always said, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood pneumonia, and a broken arm. Good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I try to be careful. Dale always worries about me, says I’m too adventurous sometimes.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a good balance of adventurous spirit and caution! No surgeries, that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant health problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that your mother, father, or siblings have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a tough one. My mom had arthritis pretty bad when she got older, and my dad…he had some trouble with his heart, I think. But he didn’t go to the doctor much, so we never really knew for sure. And I’m an only child, so…not a lot of family history to go on, really. It was mostly just…old age, I think. They both lived long lives.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and some heart trouble in your father. That's helpful to know. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle... Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never have. And Dale doesn’t either. He says it’s bad for your lungs, and he’s right. We both try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: We have a little bit sometimes, on special occasions. Like holidays, or if we’re celebrating something. But we don’t drink very often. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, that’s about it. Nothing regular, definitely not a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol use. That’s good to know. Now, before we finish up, I just want to do a quick physical exam – just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good. I haven't had a check-up in a long time, so that's probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll be right back with my stethoscope and blood pressure cuff. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/78. That’s within a normal range. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular and strong, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any concerns or anything you want me to check specifically?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mostly just wanted to get these forms filled out. I’ve been feeling pretty good, all things considered. Maybe my back has been a little sore lately, but that’s nothing new. It happens sometimes, especially after gardening. Dale always tells me to lift with my legs, but I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s easy to forget when you’re enjoying the garden! A little back soreness is common, especially with activity. We can talk about some stretches or over-the-counter pain relief if it bothers you. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, everything seems good. We've established you as a new patient, and I'm happy to be your primary care physician. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in six months to a year for a more comprehensive check-up, if you'd like. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. Six months sounds good. And thank you for being so patient with me. I’m not very good with all this medical stuff. I appreciate you taking the time. I guess we’re all set then? These forms will be done, and I can…go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you’re all set. I'll have these forms completed for you shortly. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. That's what we’re here for. Here you go. And remember, if anything changes or you start feeling unwell, please don't wait for your appointment—give us a call. It was a pleasure meeting you, Thyra. I look forward to seeing you in six months.
PATIENT: .
