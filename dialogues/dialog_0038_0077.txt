DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Well, the company sent me. Said I need to be checked. Been working in that mine a long time, you know. They worry too much, these young people. Nothing wrong with me, I assure you. But they pay me to do what they say, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A routine check-up then, as requested by your company. That's perfectly alright. Even if you feel completely well, these check-ups can be very helpful. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you do in the mine, and how long you've been doing it?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the machines. Big ones. Move the rock, mostly. Been doing it… oh, goodness. Since before you were born, I reckon. Maybe fifty years? Fifty-two, maybe. Lost count after a while. Underground, always underground. Dusty work, but a man's gotta eat, eh? Don't see no problem with it, personally. But they keep sending me for these… checks. Waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Fifty-two years! That's a long time to be doing such physical work. You're right to be proud of that. It's good you've been able to work consistently. Okay, so underground mining for fifty-two years… and you haven’t noticed any health issues as a result of the work?
PATIENT: Health issues? No. Not really. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, isn’t it? Back aches a bit, but who doesn't have a bad back at my age? Nothing to do with the mine. I'm a strong man, always been strong. Used to lift heavy things outside of work too, you know. Building my house, things like that. They worry about dust, I think. But I breathe just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And that cough just now – is that a recent thing, or has that been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, that? Just a tickle in my throat. Happens sometimes. Especially when the weather changes. Nothing serious, I tell you. Been happening for years, on and off. Like I said, old age. Dry air, that's all. You doctors always looking for something wrong.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Bigger. It's true, we are trained to look for potential issues, but that's just to make sure everything is as healthy as it can be. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I walk up the stairs at home just fine. Chest pain? Never. Wheezing… what does that even sound like? I just cough sometimes, like a normal person. You're asking too many questions now. Is this check-up going to take all day?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t take all day, I promise. I just want to be thorough. Okay, so no shortness of breath, no chest pain, no wheezing. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy? Well, I sleep more now than I used to, if that’s what you mean. But that’s because I earned my rest, you know? Fifty-two years in a mine… a man gets tired. Don't run around like a young goat anymore, that’s for sure. But I can still manage to do things around the house. Fix things, you know. Simple things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re still able to manage things around the house. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Never. Diabetes? No sweet tooth, always been a savoury man. Heart problems? Still ticking, aren't I? I've been lucky, I suppose. Never really been sick. Had a bit of the flu when I was a boy, but that's all. Doctors always ask about these things. My wife… bless her soul… she went to the doctor all the time. Always something.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like she had a lot of health concerns. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalised for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed them. Hospital? Only when my daughter was born. And that was a long time ago. Everything went fine, quick in and out. Strong family, we are. Don't break easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my joints, sometimes. When they flare up. But not all the time. Just when it rains, mostly. Old age again, you see. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, just something for your joints as needed. Do you mind telling me the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It’s a small white pill. Comes in a little bottle. I get it from the chemist down the road. Can't remember the name, to be honest. Never bothered to look. My daughter fills the prescription for me. She handles all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We can look it up later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. I eat anything. I try anything. My wife used to worry about me trying new foods when we travelled. But I’m a strong man, I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, and he didn't live a long life. I learned my lesson from that. Bad habit, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little bit, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing more. Just to relax. My wife used to enjoy a glass with me. But not much. Never been a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other routine checks. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. But don't poke around too much. I'm a sensitive man.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is a little bit high, and I can hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart. Your lungs sound mostly clear, but there's a little bit of crackling at the base, which could be due to a number of things. I'm going to listen again. Now, I'm just going to check your pulse and your reflexes. Alright, everything seems mostly normal, but the elevated blood pressure and the crackling in your lungs are something we should investigate further. I would recommend a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Now you're talking serious business. Seems like all this worrying was for something after all. My wife always said doctors just like to find things wrong. But… alright. If you think it's necessary, go ahead. But I expect a full explanation of everything you find. No fancy medical terms, understand? Plain English. And quickly. I haven't got all day to sit around waiting for results.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bigger. We'll take everything one step at a time and I promise to explain everything in plain English. The X-ray will help us see if there's anything going on in your lungs, and the blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health, checking things like your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. I'll write you a referral for both. The receptionist will schedule those for you when you’re ready to leave. They are usually done at the clinic across the street. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Clinic across the street? Good. Don't want to travel too far. And what does all this mean? You said my blood pressure is high. Is that bad? And the crackling… is that my lungs? Am I getting sick? I don’t like this one bit. All this poking and prodding for nothing… My wife always said…
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Bigger. It's completely normal to feel anxious when something unexpected is found. Let's address your concerns one by one. High blood pressure, or hypertension, means that the force of your blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. It's quite common, especially as we get older, and can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke if left untreated. But it's very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. We'll discuss that after we get the results of the tests. The crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things, from a mild chest infection to something more chronic. It's not necessarily something serious, but it's something we need to investigate further to get a clear diagnosis. That's what the X-ray is for. The tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on and help us determine the best course of action. We’re not jumping to conclusions, we're just being thorough. Before we go further, do you have any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing, like a cough, fever, or shortness of breath, even if you think they’re minor?
PATIENT: A cough, I suppose. Like I said before. Just a tickle in my throat sometimes. Nothing major. And a little tired, maybe. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? I sleep more now than I used to. And sometimes, when I walk up the stairs at home, I get a little… winded. But I manage. Still get up them, eventually. My wife used to say I pushed myself too hard. But a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me that. The cough, the fatigue, and the shortness of breath when climbing stairs are all important pieces of information. They could be related to the crackling in your lungs, or they could be something else entirely. That's why the tests are so important. Now, while we wait for the results, I recommend you take things a bit easier. Avoid strenuous activity, and if you feel short of breath, stop and rest. Do you have anyone who can help you with things around the house if you need it?
PATIENT: My daughter. She comes by sometimes. Helps with the shopping. She worries about me, you know. Always has. She's a good girl. A very good girl. But she's busy with her own life. Got a job and everything. Don't want to bother her too much. A man should be able to look after himself, shouldn't he?
DOCTOR: You absolutely should be able to look after yourself, Mr. Bigger, and I admire your independence. But it's okay to accept help when you need it, and it sounds like you have a wonderful daughter who cares about you. So, let’s summarize. We’ve discussed your history, your symptoms, and the physical exam findings. We’re going to get a chest X-ray and some blood work to investigate the high blood pressure, the crackling in your lungs, and your fatigue. The receptionist will schedule those for you. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll discuss them with you, and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just get it over with, you know? Find out what’s wrong, and hopefully it’s nothing serious. And please… plain English. No fancy medical terms. My wife… she never understood those things either.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bigger. Plain English, I promise. And we’ll take things one step at a time. The receptionist is just over there, she’ll get everything sorted for you. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. .
