DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it's… it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kandy, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things are very common, and we're here to figure out what's going on. So, you're experiencing difficulty initiating urination and it's taking a longer time than usual to empty your bladder, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That's it precisely. It’s not painful, not really. Just… frustrating. And sometimes I feel like I don’t empty it completely, if that makes sense. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month or so now, I think? It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, frustrating is a good word for it. And it's helpful to know it hasn't been a sudden onset – about a month, you said. And you mentioned sometimes feeling like you don’t fully empty your bladder. Are you noticing any dribbling after you finish urinating, or is it more of a sensation that something is still there?
PATIENT: It's more the sensation, I think. Not dribbling, no. It just feels like there's still a little bit left in there, even after I’ve gone. I usually have to… push a little to get the last bit out, which doesn’t feel very good, but I want to make sure it’s all gone. Do you understand? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Kandy. That sensation of incomplete emptying and the need to strain to finish is definitely helpful information. Okay, to get a better picture of things, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, years ago, when I was younger, I had high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on a little pill for it, and it went away. Oh, and I had a gallbladder removed, must be twenty years ago now. Besides that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. I do have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. High blood pressure in the past and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. And Medicare is important for billing, yes. Are you currently taking any medications for anything, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, occasionally. My daughter reminds me to take it when I forget, which is often, to be honest. It's called… let me see… Amlodipine, I think. Small white one. And sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, but not right now. It’s August, plenty of sun! Do you need to know exactly how much of the vitamin D I take? I always forget those details.
DOCTOR: No, not to worry about the exact dose of the Vitamin D. Amlodipine occasionally is good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, allergies, no. Nothing I'm aware of. I eat everything, pretty much. My grandmother always said, "A little of everything never hurt anyone!" And I've never had a reaction to any medicine the doctor has given me. I'm quite lucky that way.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do any close family members—parents, siblings, or children—have any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the urinary system or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother… she had diabetes, towards the end of her life. And my brother had problems with his prostate when he got older, but men get that, don’t they? I don’t think anyone else had anything… with the bladder or kidneys specifically. My sister was always very healthy, just like me. We’re a hardy bunch, Lithuanians are! Is that helpful? I'm not sure what you’re looking for exactly.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Kandy, thank you. Diabetes in your mother and prostate issues in your brother are good to know. Okay, and just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I don't smoke. Never have. My husband, God rest his soul, he smoked, but I always made him go outside. And alcohol… I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing heavy, just a small glass. Red wine, usually. It's good for the heart, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It’s nothing to worry about, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll listen to your abdomen and do a gentle exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Just tell me if it’s going to be… uncomfortable, and I’ll let you know. I do have a bit of a sensitive stomach, sometimes. And please, don't be afraid to ask if you need me to do anything. I might forget what I’m supposed to do!
DOCTOR: Of course, Kandy. I'll explain everything as I go, and we’ll go at your pace. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's have you lie down on your back. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm just going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt, no. Just a little… pressure, maybe. Like when I've eaten too much. It feels alright, though. Not painful at all. You're very gentle, Doctor. I appreciate that. My last doctor… well, let’s just say she wasn’t as careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Kandy. We want to be thorough and comfortable. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to do a quick pelvic exam. I know this can be a little uncomfortable, but it will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. We'll use plenty of lubricant and go at your pace. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? Now that does sound… unpleasant. I haven’t had one of those in years. Are you sure you need to do that? I mean, couldn’t we just… try a different test? I’m just… not very comfortable with that. I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s probably silly, but it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to express that, Kandy. It’s not silly at all. Your comfort is my absolute priority. A pelvic exam can provide valuable information, but it’s not absolutely necessary at this stage. We can certainly hold off on that if you’re uncomfortable. Instead, let’s start with a urine sample. We can test that for infection, blood, and other things that might be causing your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, a urine sample sounds much better. Thank you, Doctor. That I can do. Where do I… go? Is there a special room for that? I hope I don’t make a mess. I'm a bit clumsy sometimes, especially when I’m nervous. And I’m always forgetting things… do I need to use a special cup?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. No worries at all. There’s a restroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll explain exactly how to collect the sample. It’s very simple, and we’ve seen much worse! Don't worry about making a mess; we have everything you need. I'll write down a few instructions for you as well, just in case you forget. Just collect about 6 ounces of urine in the cup, and then bring it back to me. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You're very patient. I appreciate that. I'll go now and try not to spill. I'll be right back.
