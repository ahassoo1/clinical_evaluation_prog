DOCTOR: Hi Brendan, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor, nice to meet you too. It's this itching, really. All over, it seems. Been going on for… oh, must be a couple weeks now, at least. It’s just… annoying, you know? Nothing serious, I don’t think, but it’s driving me a bit crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, “annoying” itching for a couple of weeks. I understand. And you said “all over” – can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. It started on my arms, just little patches, like mosquito bites almost, but I haven’t been bitten by anything. Then it spread to my legs, and my back… even my chest a little. Not on my face, thankfully. And… well, pretty much everywhere else. It doesn’t really seem to be worse anywhere specifically, just… everywhere. It’s mostly just… a constant little prickle, you know? Not deep, not painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it began on your arms, spread to your legs, back, and chest, but not your face. It sounds like a generalized rash, and it's more of a prickling sensation than anything else. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn't help. Hot showers seem to make it a little worse right after, but it calms down pretty quick. And… I don’t think anything makes it better, really. I’ve tried some lotions, but they just feel… temporary. It’s always just… there in the background. I'm not sure if that helps?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Switching detergents was a good idea to rule that out. And noting the hot showers make it temporarily worse is useful. Okay, let's dig a little deeper. Have you had any fever, chills, fatigue, or any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, no feeling tired or anything like that. Just the itching. I've been… well, you know, normal. I still get out and about, do my gardening, visit my grandkids when I can. No other complaints, really. It's just this blasted itch. It's a bit distracting, sometimes, but… nothing more. I'm glad it hasn't turned into anything else, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I do, and that’s good to hear. No other systemic symptoms is reassuring. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I've never had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I know. I'm not on any medications regularly, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees, when they act up, but that's it. And I don't have any… well, any serious illnesses, I guess. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but that’s all sorted now. Nothing that should be relevant, I don’t think. I'm a pretty healthy guy, for my age. Mostly. Aside from the itch, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no regular medications, and a history of a heart issue that’s now resolved. That’s good information. Do you have a family history of skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: You know, that's a good question. My mother, God rest her soul, she had… well, she always had sensitive skin. A lot of rashes, she said, when she was a girl. Nothing diagnosed, as far as I know, but she was always complaining about something itchy. My father… no, he had tough as nails skin, never a problem. I think my sister had some dry patches sometimes, but I don't really remember what it was. Nothing serious, at least. It wasn't something we talked about much, if I'm honest. Mostly just… complaints about the weather. Russian winters will do that to you, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, Russian winters! I can imagine. Okay, so some family history of sensitive skin and rashes. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick exam. What do you do for work, and do you have any pets?
PATIENT: I work as a dispatcher. Not police or anything like that, just… regular deliveries, things like that. Mostly office work, really. Not very exciting. As for pets… I used to have a cat, a lovely tabby named Natasha. But she passed away a few years back. I miss her terribly. Haven't gotten another one yet. Too much responsibility, I think, for an old man like me. It's just me, mostly. And the grandkids when they visit, of course. They're a handful, but a good handful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dispatcher, and no current pets. That’s helpful. Alright Brendan, if you don’t mind, I’m going to take a quick look at your skin. Could you please loosen your shirt and pants a bit so I can get a good view?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Here you go. I hope you don't mind, I haven't been wearing much in the way of a shirt lately, it's been so warm. It's just a t-shirt, nothing fancy. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m looking now. I see some scattered, slightly raised patches of redness on your arms, legs, and chest, as you described. They aren’t blistering or weeping, and there isn’t any significant scaling. They do appear a bit inflamed, but not severely. No rash on the face, as you said. They’re a little warm to the touch, but no significant tenderness. Based on what I'm seeing, and considering your history, it could be a few things. It could be contact dermatitis, even though you switched detergents. It could be a mild eczema flare-up, or even a drug eruption, although you aren't on any regular medications. It’s also possible it's something called pityriasis rosea, which often starts with a single patch and then spreads. To help narrow it down, I’d like to order a skin scraping and possibly a patch test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Skin scraping and patch test… hmm. Sounds… thorough. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then yes, let’s do it. I'd like to get to the bottom of this, if possible. It's just… annoying, you know? And I'd like to be sure it's nothing serious. So yes, please. Whatever you need. Just tell me what it involves. I'm not afraid of a little… poking and prodding, but I’d like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The skin scraping is very quick. I'll gently scrape a tiny bit of skin from one of the affected areas and look at it under a microscope to see if there's any fungus or mites present. It shouldn't be painful, maybe a little uncomfortable for a second. The patch test is a bit more involved. We’ll apply small amounts of common allergens to your back and cover them with patches for 48 hours. Then we’ll see if any of them cause a reaction. It can be a little itchy, but we can manage that. Do you have any allergies to adhesives or nickel, by any chance?
PATIENT: Adhesives… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I've used bandages before, never had a problem. Nickel… now that you mention it, I used to wear a watch, a cheap one, and my wrist did get a bit itchy sometimes. But I haven’t worn a watch in years. It wasn't terribly bad, just a little irritation, I thought. So maybe a slight sensitivity to nickel, but nothing major. I can't say I've ever had a reaction, if you know what I mean. Just a little… annoyance. It's always something, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It often is! Okay, good to know about the possible nickel sensitivity. We’ll make a note of that. Alright, let’s get the skin scraping done first. Then we’ll apply the patches. It will take a few minutes. While we’re doing that, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything pretty thoroughly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. It's… comforting, to be honest. Just the thought of knowing what's going on, even if it’s something minor, is a relief. So no, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Let’s just get on with it, shall we? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, just going to gently scrape a tiny bit of skin here… this might feel a little like a scratch… Okay, that's done. Now we'll move on to the patch test. Just going to apply these small patches to your back… they'll need to stay on for 48 hours, and we’ll check for a reaction then. Try to avoid getting your back too wet during that time. Okay, here we go… Okay, all done. I’ve applied a variety of common allergens. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in 48 hours to check for a reaction. In the meantime, if you experience any severe itching, swelling, or other concerning symptoms, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, that sounds good. Forty-eight hours, avoid getting my back wet… I can manage that. And I’ll definitely call if anything gets… troublesome. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. It's a weight off my shoulders, knowing we're doing something about it. I guess I'll just go home and try to relax, then. And try not to scratch too much. It's easier said than done, though, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Exactly! Easier said than done. Just try to keep the area clean and dry. Here's the sheet with all the instructions and contact information. We'll see you in 48 hours. If you have any questions before then, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, Brendan, and try to relax. .
