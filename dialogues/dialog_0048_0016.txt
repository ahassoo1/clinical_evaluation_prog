DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Farson, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicky Farson. And please, call me Nicky if you’d like. Though, frankly, I expect a certain level of professionalism from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. Let's not waste time then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my bruising. It's… excessive. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, the one the other doctor prescribed after… well, after my wife passed. And now, just bumping into things… leaves a mark. It's rather inconvenient, to be honest. I used to be… more resilient.
DOCTOR: Right. The blood thinner… Warfarin, likely. And you’re noticing increased bruising even with minor trauma. How long has this been happening, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Warfarin… is that what it's called? I just call it “the medicine.” It’s been… hmm. A few weeks, I suppose. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I haven’t been keeping a log of every little bump and scrape, you understand. I have better things to do. But definitely more noticeable lately. It’s concerning, of course. One doesn’t want to look like a… a plum.
DOCTOR: “A plum.” Right. And are these bruises appearing spontaneously, or only after an injury?
PATIENT: Spontaneously? No, no. Definitely not spontaneously. I’m not falling all over myself, Doctor. It’s always after… well, after I knock against something. A doorframe, a table corner, even just a firm handshake sometimes. Though, people do have rather strong grips these days. It’s the amount of bruising that’s the problem, not that I'm suddenly clumsy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, injury-related, but excessive. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I feel… fine, mostly. A bit tired, perhaps. But I am getting on in years, you know. And grief is exhausting, let me tell you. Do you mean anything like… bleeding gums? No. Nosebleeds? No. I haven’t been… leaking, if that’s what you're asking. Just the bruising. It's… unsightly.
DOCTOR: Right. No bleeding from gums, nose, or anywhere else. And you say you're feeling tired, but attributing that to grief and age. Let’s run through your medical history briefly. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what led to being prescribed Warfarin?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of high blood pressure a few years back. Nothing serious. Managed with diet, mostly. And… oh, a bout of diverticulitis, ages ago. But that was treated. Honestly, I've always been a fairly robust individual. It's this medication, I tell you. Interfering with perfectly good blood. They always want to put you on something, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension, remote diverticulitis. Any surgeries, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Oh! Yes. Appendectomy when I was a boy, of course. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… a hernia repair, perhaps ten years ago? Something like that. It’s all a bit of a blur, frankly. I don't make a habit of dwelling on unpleasantness. They did a good job, as far as I know. No complications, if that’s what you’re asking. Though, the recovery was rather slow. I was a bit… older then.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, hernia repair. Family history, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Family history? Goodness. Where to begin? My father had… well, he had a heart condition. Passed away rather young, actually. My mother… she lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. Though she did suffer from arthritis, terribly. And my wife… she had… oh, never mind. It’s too painful to talk about. It’s all rather… irrelevant, isn't it? I'm the one here with the bruising.
DOCTOR: Right. History of cardiac issues in your father, arthritis in your mother. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… a little something for my joints. The arthritis, you know. Just a daily vitamin, really. And… occasionally, a pain reliever if my knees are acting up. Nothing regular, I assure you. Just whatever the pharmacist recommends. I don’t bother keeping track of names, honestly. Too much to remember. It’s all these pills, I tell you. A modern plague.
DOCTOR: Right. Joint supplement, occasional pain reliever. Well, let's have a look. Please lie down on the exam table. We’ll start with a quick assessment of the bruising. I want to see the extent of it.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I assure you, it's quite… unsightly. And please be gentle, Doctor. One doesn't want to exacerbate the problem. It’s not exactly a pleasant sight, you know. Old men are rather fragile.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noting multiple areas of bruising on your arms. Some appear recent, others are older. No significant swelling or warmth. Capillary refill is within normal limits. Your skin feels… normal. Let's check your blood pressure, quickly.
PATIENT: Blood pressure. Yes. Always the blood pressure. It's rather a nuisance, really. I used to have such good numbers, and now…well, everything seems to be deteriorating. Do hurry, Doctor. It’s rather uncomfortable lying here, you know. A man needs his dignity.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 148/82. Slightly elevated, but not critically concerning. Now, based on your history and this brief exam, the bruising is likely related to the Warfarin. However, given the extent of it, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, we need to run some blood tests. A complete blood count, a PT/INR to check your Warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It’s a standard precaution.
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, couldn't we just adjust the dosage? A little less of the medicine, perhaps? All these tests… it's rather inconvenient, you know. And expensive, no doubt. Medicare only covers so much. Is it absolutely necessary? I assure you, I’m a perfectly rational man. I can tell you whether or not I’m feeling well.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, while I appreciate your self-assessment, altering medication dosages without knowing why your bruising is excessive could be dangerous. The blood tests will provide crucial information. It’s not simply about feeling well; it's about ensuring your safety. We need to rule out other potential causes. It's standard practice. And frankly, it’s my professional responsibility. I'll have the lab draw the samples now. After that, we can discuss the results and a plan. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Professional responsibility… Honestly, doctors these days… Very well. Fine. Do whatever you deem necessary. But I expect a thorough explanation of the results. And a reasonable solution. I haven't got all day to spend in waiting rooms and laboratories. Lead the way, Doctor. I suppose there's no avoiding it. But make it quick, please.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. I’ll be in my office when you’re finished. The phlebotomist will handle everything. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available.
