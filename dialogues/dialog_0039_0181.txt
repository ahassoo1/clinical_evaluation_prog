DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Mombrun. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel. I just turned seventy-four, you see, and while I feel quite robust for my age, I believe it’s prudent to have a comprehensive look at things. Preventative measures, you understand. My wife, Elena, is most insistent on it, as well. She always says it’s better to be safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise, Mr. Mombrun. Elena sounds like a very sensible woman! A wellness check is an excellent idea – preventative care is always best. Seventy-four is a wonderful milestone, and staying on top of things is important. So, to get started, can you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Quite good, actually. I work with a construction crew, you see – nothing too strenuous these days, mostly overseeing and light duties, but it keeps me active. No aches or pains that bother me regularly, thankfully. My appetite is good – Elena keeps me well-fed, naturally! – and my sleep is sound. I might be a little slower getting up in the mornings than I used to be, but that I attribute to the years, not to any particular ailment. I’ve been… regular, shall we say, with my, uh, bathroom habits. Is that what you were hoping to hear, Doctor? I apologize if that is too much detail.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's exactly the sort of detail I need to know, Mr. Mombrun! It's very helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’re quite active and, for seventy-four, remarkably well. That's wonderful. Just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Elena would be pleased to know her cooking is contributing to my wellbeing! As for my weight... hmm. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, if I’m honest. But I believe I’ve remained fairly consistent. Perhaps a pound or two gained over the winter months, but nothing drastic. I’m a fairly tall man, you see – six foot three, I believe – so a few pounds aren’t as noticeable. I suppose I could step on the scale here, if you’d prefer?
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, Mr. Mombrun, thank you. It's just a good baseline to have. And no worries about not weighing yourself regularly; many people don't. We have a scale right over here. After that, we can talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly, or have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to step on the scale. As for my medical history… hmm. I’ve been fortunate, all things considered. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man – that was quite a fright, but it healed well. And I broke my wrist a few years back, falling off a ladder while repairing the roof. A clean break, thankfully, and the doctor set it perfectly. Other than that, just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. I’ve always been quite robust, as I mentioned. I see a cardiologist annually, just as a precaution. My father had some heart trouble later in life, and my doctor suggested it would be wise to monitor things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. 90 kilograms... and you said 6 foot 3?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, six foot three. Or very close to it. I haven’t measured myself precisely in some years, but that's approximately my height. Elena always says I'm taller, but she tends to exaggerate. A lovely woman, but... prone to embellishment, shall we say? Is that weight… concerning? I apologize if I’m being unnecessarily anxious. I simply prefer to be informed.
DOCTOR: Not at all anxious, Mr. Mombrun – quite sensible, as you said. Your BMI is about 22.6, which is within a healthy range. So that’s reassuring. It's good you see the cardiologist regularly, given your father’s history. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the medications. A small list, thankfully. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure - the cardiologist prescribed it a few years ago. It seems to be doing its job. And I take a daily multivitamin - Elena insists on that as well, to keep me “fighting fit,” as she puts it. Other than that, nothing. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I believe in a healthy diet and regular, gentle exercise. Though, as I mentioned, my exercise these days is more supervisory than strenuous.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. So lisinopril and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, travelled to many different places… never had a reaction. I recall my wife being slightly allergic to shellfish, but that’s her trouble, not mine. I do sometimes get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but that’s more of an annoyance than a true allergy, I believe. Nothing serious. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything of that nature.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. So, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father, as I mentioned, had some heart trouble later in life – congestive heart failure, I believe. He was a very robust man for most of his life, a sailor, but it eventually caught up with him. My mother suffered from arthritis in her later years – mostly in her hands and knees. It limited her mobility, sadly. And my maternal grandfather had diabetes, though I don’t know much about the specifics. Other than that… nothing immediately springs to mind. My family generally lived long lives, but not necessarily healthy lives, if that makes sense. They enjoyed good food and strong drink, and weren’t particularly concerned with preventative measures. I suppose I’m breaking the mould in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Mombrun. A history of heart trouble and arthritis, and diabetes on your maternal side. And it sounds like you are actively trying to be different from your family, which is excellent. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never have, never will. My father smoked a pipe for many years, but I always detested the smell, and I saw the toll it took on his health. I find it a most unpleasant habit. And I strongly discourage anyone I know from taking it up. A waste of money, and a detriment to one’s wellbeing. I do occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s hardly a vice, is it? A small indulgence, to be savoured, not abused.
DOCTOR: Certainly not a vice in moderation, Mr. Mombrun. And I agree with your stance on smoking. Do you drink alcohol regularly, besides that glass of wine with dinner?
PATIENT: Not regularly, Doctor. Perhaps a glass of wine on weekends, if we have company. Or a small brandy during the holidays. I'm not a heavy drinker, by any means. I prefer a good conversation and a hearty meal to a strong drink. It's more about the social aspect, if anything. Elena occasionally reminds me I’ve had enough, and I listen to her, of course. She keeps me in check. A very sensible woman, as I’ve mentioned. I find that I sleep better when I haven't indulged too much, and I like to be alert and engaged.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Mombrun. So, moderate alcohol consumption. And finally, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little bit about your work life and social activities?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As I mentioned earlier, I work with a construction crew. It's mostly overseeing these days - ensuring things are done properly, coordinating deliveries, that sort of thing. Nothing too physically demanding, thankfully. I enjoy it, keeps my mind active. I’ve been in the construction business for most of my life, you see. As for social activities… we have a small circle of friends, mostly fellow Venezuelans who settled in this area many years ago. We get together for dinner occasionally, share stories, reminisce about the old country. Elena and I enjoy going to the theatre when we can, and we take occasional trips to visit our grandchildren. They live in Florida, a long journey, but worth it to see their smiling faces. We also enjoy gardening - Elena has a beautiful rose garden, and I assist her with the heavier tasks. A quiet life, perhaps, but a contented one. I find great joy in simple pleasures, Doctor. It's a good life, a very good life.
DOCTOR: That sounds wonderful, Mr. Mombrun. A very full and satisfying life, indeed. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. It will help me get a complete picture of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I have no objections whatsoever. A thorough examination is always a good idea, as my wife reminds me. Please, proceed at your leisure. I trust your expertise implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Pulses are strong and regular in all extremities. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything sounds and feels good so far, Mr. Mombrun. Your vital signs are stable, and the physical exam doesn't reveal any immediate concerns. I'm going to order a comprehensive blood panel just to get a baseline and check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and vitamin levels. It's standard procedure for a wellness check. Would you like me to explain what will be included in the panel?
PATIENT: That’s most reassuring, Doctor. Thank you for your thoroughness. A comprehensive blood panel sounds perfectly sensible. And yes, please, if you wouldn’t mind explaining what will be included, I would greatly appreciate it. I like to be informed, as you know. It puts my mind at ease to understand what is being tested and why. I trust your judgment implicitly, of course, but knowledge is always power, as they say.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. This panel will include a complete blood count, or CBC, which checks your red and white blood cells and platelets. It can help identify any signs of infection or anemia. We'll also check a metabolic panel, which looks at your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes and blood sugar levels. That will give us a good overview of your overall metabolic health. We'll also check your cholesterol levels - HDL, LDL, and triglycerides – to assess your risk of heart disease. And finally, we’ll check your vitamin D and B12 levels, as deficiencies in those vitamins can cause fatigue and other symptoms. It's a fairly standard panel, and it will give us a good baseline to work with. The lab will draw blood, and the results should be back in about a week. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're available. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly comprehensive, Doctor. You’ve certainly covered all the bases. A week sounds reasonable. Yes, please, schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. I trust your expertise and I’m grateful for your thorough approach. Perhaps we can schedule it for a Tuesday afternoon? Elena has bridge club on Wednesdays, and I prefer to avoid scheduling appointments during her social engagements. A happy wife is a happy life, as they say.
DOCTOR: A very wise philosophy, Mr. Mombrun. Let me see... Tuesday afternoon works perfectly. How about Tuesday, August 12th, at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. August 12th at 2:00 PM is perfect. Thank you for accommodating my schedule, and for your thoroughness. I appreciate your kind attention. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave, or any specific instructions I should follow before the blood draw? Perhaps fasting beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a good question, Mr. Mombrun. For the most accurate results, please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or drink, except for water. You can still take your regular medications, unless otherwise instructed by your primary care physician. You will receive instructions from the lab when you schedule your appointment. Otherwise, just continue with your normal routine. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's a summary of your appointment details and a list of the tests we've ordered. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Excellent, Doctor. Fasting for twelve hours is perfectly manageable. I appreciate the clear instructions. And thank you for this summary. It's very helpful to have everything in writing. No, I believe that answers all my questions. Thank you again for your time and attention, Doctor Kamahele. It was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to discussing the results on August 12th.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Mr. Mombrun. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you on August 12th. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good day!
