DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 35 years of age. Please, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, thirty-five. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it's flapping, not beating steady. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” you say. Can you elaborate on that, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm… Okay. It’s like… a fast beat, but not always fast. Sometimes just… jumpy. Like it skips a beat, then goes too fast for a few seconds. Then normal again. It doesn’t hurt, just feels… off. It makes me a little tired sometimes too, after it happens.
DOCTOR: “Jumpy,” and “skips a beat.” And this happens… how frequently would you say?
PATIENT: Hmm... hard to say exactly. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes not for a whole day, then two days in a row. It’s not every day, for sure. It happens when I’m just… doing things. Walking, or even just sitting. Not when I’m sleeping though. Never when I sleep.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed in your life recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Changed? Not really. Work is the same. I still do the same things at the plant. Home is the same, my wife and I… everything is good. No big stress, no new habits, no new… foods or anything. Nothing different that I can think of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any other medical problems that you are aware of, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Just the usual colds, like everyone gets. Never anything serious. My wife always says I’m too tough to get sick.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No sir. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can help it. Just… tea sometimes, when I have a cold. But that’s it. No regular medicine, nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Never had a problem with anything. My wife gives me all kinds of things to eat, and I eat it all. She likes to cook. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any instances of heart problems – such as heart attacks, strokes, or sudden death – in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. My father… he had some trouble with his chest, years ago. Not a heart attack, I don’t think. Just… pain. He didn’t go to the doctor much either. My mother… she was healthy, mostly. No heart problems that I know of. My wife’s family… I don’t know them very well, so I couldn't tell you. Sorry. It’s not something we talk about much.
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I don’t drink alcohol, not even beer. And definitely no… other things. I work with chemicals all day, that's enough trouble for me! I need to keep my head clear.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. I think it would be prudent to perform a brief physical examination. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just have a seat here, please. I'll need you to remove your shirt. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds… slightly irregular. I’m detecting a subtle arrhythmia – an uneven rhythm. Lungs are clear. No tenderness to palpation. Peripheral pulses are within normal limits. This confirms my initial assessment.
PATIENT: Arrhythmia? Is that… bad, Doctor? What does that mean? Is it something serious? I just want to know what's going on with my heart. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: “Arrhythmia” simply means an irregular heartbeat, Mr. Puder. It can be caused by a number of factors, some benign, others… less so. Given your symptoms and the findings of my examination, I believe further investigation is warranted. I would like to order an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to get a more detailed picture of your heart’s electrical activity. I’d also like to request a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying imbalances. While it’s unlikely to be immediately life-threatening, it could indicate an underlying cardiac issue that requires attention. I want to be thorough.
PATIENT: ECG and blood… okay. That sounds… a lot. Is it expensive, Doctor? I don’t have insurance. My wife and I… we haven’t been able to afford it. Will it cost a lot of money? I’m worried about that, as much as the heart thing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Puder. Medical expenses can be… burdensome. An ECG typically costs around $150 to $250, and the blood panel approximately $100. I will see if the clinic has any financial assistance programs available. I can also write a referral to a hospital that offers reduced rates for patients without insurance. I will not subject you to unnecessary tests, but given your symptoms, I feel it is important to rule out any serious underlying condition. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests and looking into financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Please look into the money part. I want to know what’s wrong, but I don’t want to make my wife worry about bills too much. If you can help with that… that would be good. Just… tell me what I need to do next. When can I get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Very well. I have scheduled you for an ECG at City General Hospital. The appointment is on August 7th at 9:00 AM. I’ve also included a requisition for the blood panel. You can have that done at any Quest Diagnostics location. City General does have a financial assistance program. You'll need to bring proof of income and residency when you go for your appointment. I’ve included a link to their website on the referral form. As for the bloodwork, the Quest Diagnostics website lists their pricing, and I believe some locations offer discounts for uninsured patients. We will review the results of these tests at a follow-up appointment on August 14th. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: August 7th and 14th… okay, I can remember that. City General… and Quest. I’ll write it down. Financial assistance… I’ll look at the website. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful. I appreciate you trying to help with the money part, too. I was really worried about that. I guess I’ll see you on the 14th then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Puder. I trust you will find the information on the website helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any further questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care.
