DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pol-chin-ski, you say? Hmm. Well, I’m here ‘cause… things ain’t right. I get… short of breath. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. Real scratchy. It’s been going on… a while now, I guess. Don’t remember exactly when it started. Old man problems, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, dry mouth, and scratchy eyes. “A while now…” alright. And can you tell me a bit more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: More… how to say… it comes and goes. Not like I'm runnin' a marathon, you understand. Just… walkin' up the stairs, maybe. Or… thinkin’ too hard. It just… takes my breath. Used to be able to do anything. Now? Forget about it. And it’s worse when it’s hot, definitely worse when it’s hot. This summer’s been a killer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to exertion, and worse in the heat. Does it happen when you’re resting, or only with activity?
PATIENT: Resting… hmm. Sometimes. Not always. Mostly when I do somethin'. But I wake up some mornings feelin' like I ran a race in my sleep. Don't make much sense, do it? My wife used to say I talked in my sleep. She's… gone now. Long time ago. Don’t remember all the details. Old age, you know. Things… fade.
DOCTOR: It does sound a little concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we should explore it. Let's talk about some other things. Have you had any cough with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Cough? Not really. A little tickle sometimes, but no real cough. Just… dry. Like the rest of me. Everything’s dry. I used to smoke, a long time ago. Maybe that’s it? Everybody smoked back then. Seemed like a good idea at the time. Stupid, I guess. Now they say it’s bad. Shoulda listened to my mother. She always said… well, I don't remember what she said. Old age, remember? It’s a curse.
DOCTOR: Okay, past smoking is good to know. And about how long ago did you quit, and how much did you smoke?
PATIENT: Quit… oh, goodness. A long time. Must be… forty, fifty years ago? Something like that. I smoked… a pack a day, maybe more when I was workin’. Traffic Technician, you know? Long hours, stress. Needed somethin' to calm my nerves. Lucky Strikes. That was my brand. They don’t make ‘em anymore, probably for the best. Everything’s changed. Everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, besides the shortness of breath and dryness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My legs… they swell up sometimes. Especially at the end of the day. And I get tired. Real tired. Not just the normal old man tired, but… heavy tired. Like I’m carryin' rocks. And… I think I lost some weight, but maybe I’m just imagining things. My daughter keeps tellin’ me I need to eat more. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the legs, heavy fatigue, and possible weight loss. Have you noticed any chest pain or palpitations – that’s a fast or irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not really. Sometimes a little… discomfort. Like somethin’ tight, but not pain. And my heart… beats sometimes. What do you call it… flutters? Like a bird in my chest. But not often. Comes and goes, like everything else. Makes me nervous, though. I don’t want to drop dead in the middle of the grocery store. That’d be a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional tightness in the chest and palpitations. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me a long time ago, somethin’ about my numbers being high. Gave me a pill. I took it for a while. Then I forgot. Old age, you know? I don’t remember what it was for exactly. And diabetes… no, never been told that. Heart problems… not that I know of. I used to be strong as an ox. Workin’ on the traffic lights, you had to be. But that was a long time ago. Everything gets weaker, eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That's about it. And I was in the hospital once… when I broke my leg. Fallin' off a ladder. Workin' on a traffic light, naturally. That was a mess. Long time ago. They put a cast on it. Everything hurts, eventually. Old age, you know? It’s a curse. I don’t remember the details. Everything fades. Except the pain. I remember the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, she’s gone now. Long time ago. We had a daughter, she visits sometimes. Worries too much. And… I had a brother, but he passed away a long time ago. Heart trouble, I think. Always was a sickly man. And… I had a mother, and a father. They’re both gone now. That was a long time ago. Everything fades, eventually. Old age, you know? It’s a curse. I don't remember much about their health. Everything fades. Except the sadness. I remember the sadness.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. I got somethin’ for my water. The doctor gave me a pill. Makes me pee more. That’s about it. And… sometimes I take somethin’ for my knees. When they act up. But I forget to take it half the time. And… I used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, but I stopped. Old age, you know? I forget things. Everything fades. Except the pain. I remember the pain. Do I take somethin' for my heart? I can't remember. Everything fades. It’s a curse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. It won't take long. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Yeah, alright. Do what you gotta do. I don't feel much anyway. Just… tired. And short of breath. But go ahead. Whatever you gotta do. Just… don't take too long. I got things to do. Well, not really things. Just… old man things. You know. But go ahead. Do what you gotta do. I don't mind. Much. Everything fades, eventually. Except the pain. I remember the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. A little elevated. Now I'll listen to your heart. Okay, a little murmur there, and a slightly irregular heartbeat. Now your lungs. A few crackles in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Finally, I'll check your legs. Some swelling in your legs as well. Okay, that's all for now.
PATIENT: Swelling… yeah, my daughter keeps tellin' me about the swelling. Crackles? What are crackles? Sounds bad. And what's a murmur? Is that serious? I knew I shouldn't have smoked. Shoulda listened to my mother. Everything's fallin' apart, isn't it? Just like everything else. Everything fades, eventually. Except the pain. I remember the pain. What's gonna happen now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. The crackles in your lungs and the swelling in your legs suggest there's some fluid buildup. The murmur is an extra sound your heart makes, and it can be caused by a variety of things. Right now, it's hard to say exactly what's going on without further testing. Your blood pressure is also a bit elevated, which can contribute to these issues. We need to do a few tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs. I also want to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm and rule out any serious problems. And a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any underlying causes for the fluid buildup. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Always more tests. What will they show? Just tell me what's wrong. I don't want to be a bother. I just want to feel normal again. I used to be strong. Used to be able to do anything. Now… just tired. And short of breath. X-ray… EKG… blood tests… Alright, do what you gotta do. But don't take too long. I don't have much time left, do I? Everything fades, eventually. Except the pain. I remember the pain. My daughter will worry. She always worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. The tests will help us figure out what’s causing your symptoms and how best to treat them. They're not meant to be a bother – they're a necessary step to getting you feeling better. It’s good your daughter cares for you. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible. I'll have the nurse schedule those for you right away. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a diuretic - a water pill - to help get rid of some of the fluid buildup. It's the same one you were taking before, I believe. And I want you to limit your salt intake. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Salt… limit salt. I used to love salt. Everything tastes bland without salt. And the water pill… I forgot about that one. Always forgettin' things. My daughter will have to remind me. She does everything for me. A good daughter. Questions? Hmm. Will I… will I be able to walk up the stairs again? That's all I really want. Just to be able to walk up the stairs without gettin' all winded. Is that too much to ask? Everything fades, eventually. Except the pain. I remember the pain. What if… what if it’s serious? Don’t tell me it’s serious. I don’t want to worry my daughter.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, it's understandable that you're worried. It’s too early to say definitively what's causing your symptoms. The tests will give us a better picture. We are seeing some signs that need to be investigated – the fluid buildup and the irregular heartbeat. These things can be serious, but they're also often manageable with treatment. Right now, I don't want you to jump to conclusions. Let's get the test results first, and then we'll discuss the best course of action. As for walking up the stairs, that’s a reasonable goal. With treatment, we hope to improve your breathing and energy levels, which should make that easier. I want to be realistic with you, but I also want you to know that we’re going to do everything we can to help. I’m going to call in a referral to a cardiologist as well - a heart specialist - to get another opinion. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… another doctor. More tests. It’s always something. I just want to feel normal again. I used to be strong. I used to be able to do anything. Now… just tired. And short of breath. A referral… alright. Do what you gotta do. Just… don’t take too long. I don’t have much time left, do I? Everything fades, eventually. Except the pain. I remember the pain. My daughter will worry. She always worries too much. Is there anything… anything I can do? Besides the water pill and the salt? Anything to… to make things better? Just a little bit better? Before… before it’s too late?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, you’re right to ask. There are things you can do. Even small changes can make a difference. Try to get some gentle exercise, like walking for a few minutes each day if you’re able. It might seem counterintuitive when you’re short of breath, but it can actually help improve your breathing over time. And make sure you’re getting enough rest. It’s important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Also, it’s important to stay hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day, but avoid sugary drinks. And if you're a smoker, even if you quit a long time ago, it’s important to avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Finally, and this is important, try to stay positive. I know it's hard when you’re not feeling well, but a positive attitude can make a big difference in your overall health and well-being. I'm going to write all of this down for you, along with the instructions for the water pill. And I'll have the nurse schedule those tests for you right away. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Positive attitude… easy for you to say. You're young and healthy. Everything's fallin' apart, isn't it? Just like everything else. But… alright. I'll try. I'll try to stay positive. And I'll try to walk a little bit. And I'll try to drink more water. For my daughter. Write it down… yes, please. I forget things. Always forgettin' things. And schedule the tests… alright. Do what you gotta do. No… I don't think so. That's all. Thank you, doctor. For tryin'. Just… thank you. I'm tired now. I think I'll go home. And rest. And try to stay positive.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guilds. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll have the nurse come in and go over everything with you, and schedule those tests. Remember, we’re in this together. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and try to stay positive.
