DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I don’t really need anything, not like being sick or hurt. I just need to get some forms filled out for… Medicare, I think? It’s a bit of a hassle, and they said I needed to come in to do it with someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So it’s more of a compliance visit to fulfill some paperwork requirements for Medicare. That's perfectly alright. We can certainly get those forms completed for you. It’s good you came in – sometimes these things are easier to tackle with a little assistance. Before we jump into the forms, though, just to be thorough, would you mind if I ask a few general health questions?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, that’s fine. No problem at all. Ask away. I don’t mind. Just let me know if I don't know something, okay? Sometimes my head gets foggy with all this paperwork stuff already!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fabing. That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. No question is silly. Let’s start with your overall health. Have you been feeling well generally?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I mean, I work pretty hard, you know, installing and fixing valves and stuff. It can be physical, but I’m used to it. No major complaints, no aches that won’t go away, nothing like that. Just…tired sometimes, but I think that’s just the work. How’s that for an answer?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good answer, Ms. Fabing. It’s good to hear you’re generally feeling well and that your tiredness seems related to your work. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say “tired,” is it more of a physical exhaustion, or do you feel mentally fatigued as well?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It’s…both, I guess. My body definitely feels it after a long day on a job site. But sometimes, even when I’m sitting down, I feel kinda… drained, like my brain is slow. Not all the time, but it happens. It’s hard to explain, you know? It’s not like I'm sick tired, just… heavy.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Fabing. “Heavy” is a good way to describe it. It’s helpful to know it affects you both physically and mentally. Let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I eat pretty much the same as always. My husband’s a good cook, so I don’t have to worry about that! And my weight… it kinda stays the same too. I might lose a pound or two after a really hard job, but it usually comes right back. I’m a pretty steady person, I think, in most ways.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fabing. Stable appetite and weight are positive signs. Now, thinking about your energy levels more generally, have you noticed any difficulty with sleep?
PATIENT: Well…that’s a little bit of a problem, actually. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, usually. But I wake up a lot during the night. Not every night, but pretty often. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I end up tossing and turning for a while. It doesn’t leave me totally exhausted, but I don’t feel very rested when I get up. I just figured it was from being tired from work, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you fall asleep easily, but experience some nighttime awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep. That does sound a little more concerning than just simple work fatigue. How many times, on average, would you say you wake up during the night?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez, that’s hard to say. Some nights it’s just once, maybe twice. Other nights… it feels like every couple of hours. It’s not always a full waking up, sometimes it’s just…shifting around, restless. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s not like I'm jumping out of bed, just… unsettled. I don't usually look at the clock, I try not to, because then I get even more frustrated.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Fabing. Frequent awakenings and restlessness are important details. It's good you've been trying to avoid looking at the clock. Now, let’s quickly touch on other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – anything different with your stool or frequency?
PATIENT: Nope, pretty regular, thankfully. I haven't had any trouble with that, knock on wood. Everything's…normal, I guess. My grandma always said a regular routine was important, and I guess I listen to her! I eat enough fiber, that's for sure. We have a garden, so lots of fresh veggies. Sorry if that’s too much information!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Fabing. That’s good to hear. And your grandma sounds very wise! Now, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, or noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Like I said, my weight stays pretty steady. And I haven’t been sick, no fever or chills or anything. I get a little warm sometimes, but that’s usually just from working hard in the sun. No night sweats either. I’m a pretty warm person naturally, but not like…sweaty all the time, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No unexplained weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats. Now, just one last quick question for the review of systems. Have you noticed any new aches or pains, or any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my knees get a little achy after a long day on the job site, especially if I’ve been kneeling a lot. But that’s just from the work, I think. Old work injury from a few years back, nothing major. No swelling, just a little bit of stiffness. And my hands sometimes get a little sore, from using tools all day. But nothing that keeps me from working, you know? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, some knee and hand aches related to your work, and a previous work injury. That sounds reasonable. Now, Ms. Fabing, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, I think. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that, but I haven't had any serious illnesses. The doctor checks my blood pressure every year at my checkup, and it's always been okay. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I think it’s the good food and hard work, you know? Keeps a person going.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fabing. No chronic medical conditions and good overall health is wonderful to hear. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was about ten, fell out of a tree. That was about it, though. No other surgeries, no other hospital stays. I've been pretty good at avoiding those things, thankfully! I try to be careful, you know? Working with tools and all… you gotta be.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm as a child. Nothing recent. Now, I'm going to ask about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my grandma on my mother’s side had diabetes, I think. And my dad’s brother had heart trouble, I remember that. He didn’t take care of himself very well, always smoked and ate junk food. And… I think my aunt had high blood pressure. Other than that, not really. Most of my family are pretty healthy, too. They all live a long time, which is a good sign, I guess. We're tough people, Blackfeet. We gotta be.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your maternal grandmother, heart trouble in your paternal uncle, and high blood pressure in an aunt. That's good information to have. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband tried it once, a long time ago, but he didn’t like it. And no, I don’t drink alcohol, either. Don't care for it. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in that stuff. I just like a good night’s sleep after a hard day’s work, that’s all. I try to take care of myself, you know? Healthy body, healthy mind.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fabing. That’s a very healthy lifestyle. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm a control and valve installer and repairer. Basically, I go to different sites – factories, water treatment plants, stuff like that – and install and fix the valves and control systems for the pipes. It’s pretty physical work, a lot of kneeling, lifting, crawling around in tight spaces. Sometimes I have to work outdoors in all kinds of weather. It’s good work, though, and I’m pretty good at it. Been doing it for about ten years now. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. It’s important work, you know, making sure everything runs smoothly.
DOCTOR: That sounds like very demanding work, Ms. Fabing. A lot of physical strain and exposure to different environments. Alright, I think I have a good understanding of your history now. Now, you mentioned some nighttime awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep. You've had these for some time, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, maybe six months or so? It’s not every night, but it happens pretty often. Like I said, it doesn’t leave me totally exhausted, but I don't feel very rested when I get up. It's kinda frustrating, to be honest. I just thought it was from being tired from work, but… maybe it’s something else? I just wanted to get it checked out, you know? To make sure everything's okay. I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea to get it checked out, Ms. Fabing. Six months of intermittent sleep disturbance is definitely worth investigating. Before we proceed with a physical exam, and potentially some blood work, I want to clarify a few things. Do you experience any snoring, or has anyone told you that you stop breathing during sleep?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My husband says I snore sometimes, but he says it’s not very loud. He hasn’t said anything about me stopping breathing, no. He sleeps pretty soundly himself, so maybe he wouldn’t notice. I don’t think I’ve ever woken myself up gasping for air, or anything like that. I just wake up restless, you know? Not a dramatic thing, just… unsettled. Is that a sign of something? I always worry about those things.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Fabing. Occasional snoring without reports of pauses in breathing is less concerning. We’re not jumping to conclusions, but it’s good to rule things out. Given your history of intermittent sleep disturbance, physical work, and reported restlessness, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Dr. Gegan. I just want to figure out what's going on, and get back to sleeping soundly. I don’t want this to interfere with my work, you know? It's important work, and I need to be on top of things. Let’s do the exam, and see what you find.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table, we can get started. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first, then check your blood pressure. Your heart sounds regular, normal rate and rhythm. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given you just described physical work. I’m going to palpate your thyroid now… …thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and neurological function. This won’t take long. Everything appears normal there as well. Overall, the physical exam doesn’t reveal any obvious cause for your sleep disturbance. However, given the duration and your reported fatigue, I'd like to order some blood work to check for common causes of fatigue, such as iron deficiency, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If that’s what you think is best, let’s do the blood work. I just want to rule everything out, you know? I don’t want anything serious going on. And I want to get back to sleeping soundly, so I can be on top of things at work. I trust your judgment, Dr. Gegan. Whatever you need, just let me know. I’m happy to get it done. It’s just…a little worrying, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It’s perfectly normal to be worried, and that’s why we’re here. Blood work is a standard procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I’m going to write you a lab order now. It will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin D level, and iron studies. You can take this to the lab across the street, and they’ll draw the blood. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a sleep diary for one week. Just write down what time you go to bed, what time you wake up, and how many times you wake up during the night. This will help us get a better understanding of your sleep patterns. Here’s the sleep diary. Do you have any questions about the blood work or the sleep diary?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds pretty straightforward. Blood work, sleep diary… I can do that. I’ll take this to the lab across the street, and keep track of my sleep for a week. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… any warning signs I should look out for? I always worry about those things, you know? Just in case. I don't want anything serious, like… heart trouble or something. I just want to get back to normal. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure things out, Dr. Gegan. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned. As for warning signs, if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please seek immediate medical attention. But those are unlikely given your exam findings. Otherwise, just focus on keeping the sleep diary and getting the blood work done. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. For now, I don’t believe there is anything else you need to do. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Gegan. I really appreciate it. I feel a lot better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Okay, so… blood work, sleep diary, call if anything changes. Got it. Thank you again for your time. I appreciate you listening and taking my concerns seriously. I'll see you in a few days when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please try to get some rest. We’ll see you soon.
