DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Tofani, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Gorga, is it? Yes, well, it’s a bit… fuzzy, you know? My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. There’s a history of that in the family, I think. My mama had terrible headaches, and… oh dear, what was I saying? It just doesn’t come as easily anymore.
DOCTOR: Right, weakness and headaches. Okay. And you said a family history of headaches… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mama… she’d be just laid up sometimes. Couldn’t get out of bed. Terrible, throbbing pain. And my brother, he had… spells, I suppose you’d call them. One side of his body would just… not work right. It didn't happen often, but it was frightening. He’s gone now, God rest his soul. It was years ago. I… do I remember correctly? It feels like a dream sometimes, all those years…
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had severe, debilitating headaches, and your brother experienced… weakness on one side of his body, intermittently. Do you remember if anyone ever had a name for what your brother had?
PATIENT: A name? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I recall. Doctors came, of course, but… it was a long time ago, and things weren’t like they are now. They just said he was having… trouble. With his nerves, maybe? Or something with his blood pressure? It was all very confusing. He mostly just rested, and it would pass. I wish I could be more help. My memory… it's a sieve, truly.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mrs. Tofani. We can work with what you do remember. Let’s focus on your symptoms now. You mentioned weakness and headaches. Can you describe the headaches for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my headaches. They’re not as bad as my mama’s, thank goodness. They come and go, you know? A dull ache, mostly, right here… … and sometimes behind my eyes. It’s like a tight band around my head. And lately… well, I’ve been feeling a little… off-balance, sometimes. And a little tired. It’s hard to explain. Just… not quite myself. The weakness… it’s not constant. It just comes and goes in my arm, I think. My right arm, maybe? It’s all so… vague.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s just take a few measurements first. Blood pressure looks a little elevated, 148 over 82. Pulse is steady at 78. We'll do a quick neurological exam just to check things out. Could you please hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you think is best. Is that right? It feels a little… heavy, suddenly. I don’t usually notice it until someone asks me to hold something, you know? It’s funny how that works. I’m not a very strong woman, never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, I did notice a slight weakness on your right side. Nothing terribly concerning at this point, but we should investigate further. Let's check your reflexes now. I'm going to tap on your knees and elbows with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t hurt.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Sounds… thorough. My husband, bless his heart, he always said I was a worrier. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try to relax. Though my knees aren't what they used to be, I can tell you that much! They ache with the weather, you know? Everything aches with the weather these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little diminished on your right side compared to your left. Now, I'm just going to shine a light in your eyes to check your pupils. This is just to make sure everything is working as it should.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Shining lights, you say? Everything seems… bright. I had my eyes checked last year, I think. The doctor said I needed stronger glasses, but… well, I haven’t gotten around to it yet. It’s just one thing after another, you know? I see well enough, mostly. Especially when I’m reading the newspaper, though the print is getting smaller all the time…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Tofani. Everything seems… relatively normal, but there are a few things I want to investigate further. Given your symptoms – the headaches, weakness, and some asymmetry on the neurological exam – and your family history, I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain. It will help us rule out any serious causes for your symptoms. I also want to do some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan… that sounds… serious, doesn’t it? Is it… painful? And blood work… I always bruise so easily. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes, alright. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s unsettling, not knowing. And my daughter… she worries so. She’ll be relieved if we find out something. So yes, go ahead. Do what you need to do. I just hope it’s nothing too terrible.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mrs. Tofani. A CT scan is a quick and painless procedure. We just take some pictures of your brain to get a better look. The blood work is routine. We’ll send you to the lab right away, and the radiology department will schedule the scan as soon as possible. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. It's best to be thorough and get a clear understanding of what’s going on. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, a neurologist… that sounds important. Yes, alright. I understand. Emergency room… if it gets bad. Sudden headache… I’ll remember. My daughter will remind me, too, she’s very good at that. So… blood work first? And then the scan? And I’ll see this… neurologist? It’s a lot to keep track of. But yes, I’ll do whatever you say, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Is there anything else I need to know right now?
DOCTOR: Yes, just the blood work and the scan. And the referral information for the neurologist. This paper has all the details, including the lab address and phone number. The radiology department will call you to schedule the scan. In the meantime, try to get some rest, and drink plenty of fluids. And don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I think that’s all for now, Mrs. Tofani. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Do you need help getting to the lab?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to ask, Doctor. No, I think I can manage. My daughter usually drives me, but she's at work today. I live just down the road, really. A short walk. I appreciate your concern. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You’ve been very patient with me. And I really do appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s a relief just knowing someone is looking into it. I think I’ll just be on my way, then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Tofani. That's what I'm here for. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. And please, let me know how the scan goes. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. .
