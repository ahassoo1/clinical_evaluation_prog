DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker, good to see you. Though frankly, I have a packed schedule today, so let's get right down to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… something with being tired. Very tired. It comes and goes, you see. And the young man at the lab… he said something about my numbers being off. Something about… muscles, I think? Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. It’s probably just old age creeping up on me. Though my husband, bless his heart, he insisted I come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right, "tired" and "numbers being off." Lab results… Okay. Well, “tired” is… vague. Comes and goes, you say?
PATIENT: Vague? It is tiring, young man! What more do you want me to say? It's not like it's a simple thing to explain. Some days I can get up and potter around the garden, do a bit of weeding… other days, getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. It's… debilitating, sometimes. And it's not like I've been doing anything strenuous. I certainly haven’t been climbing mountains! Though, I used to be quite the diver, back in my day… but that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to get… animated. “Debilitating” is… helpful, I suppose. So, it affects your daily activities. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long…? That’s a difficult one. It comes and goes, doesn’t it? I suppose… a few months, maybe? It started… around the time the weather turned warmer, I think. Though, I do get tired in the winter, too. It’s hard to say. Everything seems to blur together when you get to be my age, you know. I really wish people wouldn’t ask me to remember things like dates. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: A few months… fluctuating… Okay. Let’s try this. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… well, I feel tired, of course. Is that not enough? Oh… sometimes my muscles ache a little. Not terribly, mind you. Just a dull sort of ache. Like after a long walk, but I haven't had a long walk in ages. Honestly, I don’t go making a fuss over every little thing. People these days… always complaining about something. Though, I did notice my hands felt a bit clumsy when I was trying to arrange the flowers yesterday… but that could be just the arthritis acting up. It’s always something, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, muscle aches, clumsiness...and you mentioned arthritis. Do you take anything for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a little something the doctor gave me years ago. A small white pill. Can’t recall the name, of course. Old age, you know. I take it every morning with my tea. And a vitamin… something or other. My daughter makes sure I take it. She worries about my bones. Always fussing, that one. Honestly, it’s a good job she keeps track of these things, because I certainly don’t. It all just… blends together. A pill, a vitamin… that's all I know. I wouldn't want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Right. A "small white pill." Okay. Well, let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Oh, goodness. At my age…? Well, I suppose I can try. It might be a bit wobbly, you understand. Don’t expect any fancy maneuvers. My balance isn't what it used to be. And please, be careful. I don’t want to fall and cause a fuss. There, how's that? A bit shaky, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Not bad, considering. Do you feel any weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well… not constantly. But sometimes, when I'm getting up from a chair, or climbing the stairs… it feels like it takes a bit more effort than it used to. It’s just a… fleeting sensation, really. Nothing to write home about. Though, my husband did mention I was shuffling a little when I was walking the other day. He always notices these things. Honestly, I think he worries too much. I’ve always been a bit… delicate, you see. Never been one for rough and tumble. Though, I did do quite a bit of diving, back in my day… but that was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Let's get some bloodwork done, just to rule things out. We'll check your Vitamin D, B12, and a complete metabolic panel. It's probably just a deficiency, but we need to be sure. And I'm going to order a CK level, just to check for muscle damage. It’s a standard procedure. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Oh, more bloodwork? Honestly, they take so much of it these days. I feel like a pin cushion. And what was that about… muscle damage? That sounds rather alarming, doesn’t it? Is something terribly wrong? I told you, I’m just an old woman. It’s probably just old age. Though, my husband… he always insists on these tests. He worries too much. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s a very minor blood draw, Mrs. Oitker. It will be a quick pinch, that’s all. And it’s standard procedure to rule things out. We need to be thorough. It's likely nothing serious. We're just checking for a vitamin deficiency or something similar. It's a precaution. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Easier said than done when you’re hearing about muscle damage and needles! Honestly, young man, you’re making me quite anxious. I just came in because I was a bit tired, and now I’m being subjected to all sorts of tests and… and damage talk. My husband is going to have a field day with this. He always says I worry too much, but he's the one who drags me to all these appointments! Will I be able to go home afterwards? I have my tea to think about, you know. It needs to steep for just the right amount of time.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’ll be able to go home afterwards. And it’s unlikely there is any damage. We’re simply ruling things out. Look, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will explain everything to you. Just try to remain calm, and we’ll get through this. I’ll be back to discuss the results when they're available. .
PATIENT: Oh! Well! That was… abrupt. Honestly, young people these days… no bedside manner at all. My husband is going to hear about this, I assure you. Muscle damage… honestly! And now I'm just supposed to sit here and wait? I need my tea. And a biscuit. This is all very unsettling.
