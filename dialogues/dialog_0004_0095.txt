DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s going to fall off. Is that detailed enough for you? It’s quite upsetting, actually.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… colorful description, Ms. Nissenbaum, a little more precision would be helpful. "Can’t hear" is vague. Is it complete deafness, muffled sound, ringing?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not a doctor. It’s gone. No sound. Nothing. And my face… the left side, it just feels… weak. Like when you have a really bad toothache and it radiates? Something like that, but all over. I don’t need a detailed examination of my descriptive abilities, I need to know what’s wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Nissenbaum. Let's try to be systematic. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness is concerning. To get a better understanding, I need to ask some more questions. First, how long ago did this begin?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. I woke up, went to get a glass of water, and… nothing. Maybe six, seven hours ago? It wasn’t a gradual thing, it just was. Honestly, I don't have time for a twenty-question game. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Six to seven hours. Very well. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No. Just… this. No headache, no dizziness, no fever. Just the ear and the face. And frankly, a great deal of annoyance. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent? What do you consider recent? I had a cold in February, but that was ages ago. Nothing since then. Look, I’m a very healthy woman, generally. This is… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of hearing loss or neurological issues?
PATIENT: Honestly? No idea. My husband passed away five years ago, and we weren’t close to his family. My parents are… gone. I don’t really do family history. Is it absolutely necessary to know if Aunt Mildred had a ringing in her ear in 1952?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Ms. Nissenbaum, but we can proceed without it for now. Let's move on. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: No. I don't believe in filling my body with chemicals. A little bit of ginger tea when I’m feeling unwell, that’s it. I prefer a natural approach, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a brief examination to assess the hearing loss and facial weakness. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Finally. Some actual doing. Yes, alright. Let’s get on with it. The sooner I know what’s wrong, the sooner I can… well, do something about it.
DOCTOR: I’m going to start with your ears, to confirm the hearing loss and check for any obvious abnormalities. Then I’ll test your facial muscle strength. Please let me know if anything is painful. Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum, the Weber test shows lateralization to the unaffected ear, and the Rinne test shows conductive hearing loss on the left side. There is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. Specifically, your forehead muscles seem less responsive, and you have difficulty fully closing your left eye and smiling symmetrically. It appears to be a lower motor neuron facial palsy.
PATIENT: Lower motor neuron… what does that mean? Is it serious? And what caused it? I haven’t had a stroke, have I? I feel perfectly fine otherwise. Just… this ear and this face.
DOCTOR: A lower motor neuron facial palsy means there’s a problem with the nerve that controls the muscles on the left side of your face. It's not necessarily a stroke, but it can be a symptom of one. However, the most common cause is Bell’s palsy, which is often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. It’s usually temporary, but it requires prompt evaluation to rule out other causes, like a tumor or infection, and to determine the best course of treatment. I want to order a stat MRI of the brain to rule out other causes and an ESR and CRP to check for inflammation. I'm also going to prescribe a course of oral corticosteroids to reduce swelling of the nerve.
PATIENT: MRI? Corticosteroids? That sounds… drastic. I told you I don’t believe in filling my body with chemicals! And a tumor? Are you saying I have a tumor? This is just ridiculous. I came in here with a blocked ear and a weak face, not expecting a full-blown medical crisis. Is there anything else I can do? Any natural remedies?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your reluctance, but we need to be thorough. We cannot rule out serious pathology without imaging. Bell’s palsy can resolve on its own, but corticosteroids have been shown to improve recovery rates if started within 72 hours of symptom onset. As for “natural remedies,” there's no scientific evidence to support their effectiveness in treating Bell’s palsy or excluding more serious causes. Warm compresses and eye drops to prevent corneal dryness are helpful supportive measures, but they will not address the underlying cause. I strongly recommend the MRI and the course of corticosteroids. Ignoring this could have serious consequences. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve never had any problems with medication before, but I still don’t like the idea of pumping my body full of… whatever those things are. But… a tumor… you really think there's a possibility of a tumor? Alright, fine. Do the MRI. But I want all the results explained to me, in plain English, no medical jargon. And if it turns out to be this Bell’s palsy, I'm going to need you to tell me exactly what that is, and what I can do to prevent it from happening again. And no, I will not be taking any of those chemicals until I understand everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the MRI of the brain with and without contrast. The imaging will help us rule out structural causes. I will personally review the results with you in detail, using clear, understandable language. I'll also explain Bell's palsy and discuss preventative measures, although, to be clear, the exact cause is often unknown. My nurse will schedule the MRI for you. She will also go over the preparation instructions. I will write a prescription for the oral corticosteroids, but you can hold off on filling it until we have reviewed the results of the MRI. Are there any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. I have a life to get back to. And please, no more talk of tumors. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nissenbaum. My nurse will be with you shortly. .
