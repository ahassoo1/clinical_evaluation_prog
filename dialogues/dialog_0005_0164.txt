DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor. It’s… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired, and I’ve gotten kind of yellow-looking, especially in my eyes. It started a few days ago, and I realized it happened after I ate fava beans. I love them, but now… I’m worried.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I had them with dinner a couple of times last week. I didn’t think much of it at first, just felt a little off. But then the tiredness got worse, and my wife pointed out I looked… unwell. She suggested I come see someone, just in case. I don’t usually get sick, so this is a bit worrying for both of us.
DOCTOR: Hm. Alright. And you said tiredness… is that all?
PATIENT: No, not all. I've also felt a bit weak, like I don't have much energy. And… my pee has been really dark, almost brown. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced before. I don’t have a fever or anything like that, thankfully. It just feels… off, you know? Like something isn’t right inside.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and fatigue… have you been drinking enough water, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I think so. I usually drink a couple of liters a day, maybe more in this heat. I try to stay hydrated. It’s just… it's not a dehydration kind of tired, if that makes sense? It's… deeper, and the color of my urine really has me concerned. It's not like anything I've ever seen.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, fava beans are… interesting. Let's get a quick look at you, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to feeling normal. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a basic physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your abdomen. And I’ll need to check your sclera – that’s the whites of your eyes – to get a better look at this yellowing you mentioned. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Should I… should I take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: No, no, that won’t be necessary. Just relax. Let me listen to your heart first. Take a deep breath… and another one.
PATIENT: Okay, like this? Is that alright? I sometimes feel a little anxious at the doctor's office, I hope that's not a problem.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your abdomen. Gently lie flat, if you would. I'm just going to palpate it – press around a bit. Tell me if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a little tender, actually, right about here. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And a bit further down, it feels… full? I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Full, you say. Alright. And now, let me check your sclera. Yes, there is definite jaundice. Your sclera are quite yellowed.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad? I mean, you said definite, so it sounds serious. What does that mean, exactly? And could the fava beans really be causing all of this? I've always eaten them without any problem before.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Haggar, it could be a number of things, but given the fava bean history, we need to consider Favism. It's a genetic deficiency, meaning your body doesn’t process something in the beans correctly. It can cause what we’re seeing. But we can’t just assume. We need blood work. A complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay. That'll tell us for sure.
PATIENT: Favism… I’ve never heard of that before. Is it… serious? And a genetic deficiency? Does that mean… my children could have it too? I have two grown children, I hope they’re okay. I’m suddenly feeling a bit scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, yes. But it's manageable with avoidance of triggering substances – like fava beans. And yes, it’s genetic. Your children would have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene if your partner also carries it – but they may not exhibit symptoms. We can do testing on them if you’d like. But let’s focus on you first. I’m ordering the blood work now. The lab is downstairs; just tell them you’re here for Dr. Donate’s orders. And, to be safe, I'm going to recommend you avoid any foods that might contain fava beans until we get the results back.
PATIENT: Okay. Avoid fava beans… I can do that. My husband… he doesn’t eat them often, but sometimes he has them in a stew. We’ll definitely need to check with him. And maybe my children should get tested, just to be sure. How long will the results take? And… what happens if it is Favism? Will I need special treatment? I’m just… a little overwhelmed right now.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 24-48 hours. As for treatment… there’s no ‘cure’ for Favism, Ms. Haggar. The treatment is avoidance. Severe cases may require blood transfusions, but that's rare. We’ll monitor your liver function, of course. Look, it's a manageable condition, truly. It just requires… awareness. And, frankly, you probably have been avoiding a lot of the triggers unknowingly all this time. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies, thankfully. Okay, awareness… avoidance. I can remember that. I guess it’s better than… whatever else it could be. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, even though it’s a bit frightening. I’ll go get the blood work done right away. Is there anything else I should do or know before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, just go downstairs, give them this requisition, and they’ll take care of it. Avoid fava beans and anything potentially containing them. And if you start to feel significantly worse – severe fatigue, jaundice worsening, dark urine gets darker – go to the emergency room immediately. It's unlikely, but we must be cautious. Here is a printed handout about Favism and a list of foods to avoid. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Donate. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly, and for the handouts. I’ll go get the blood work done right away. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Haggar. And please, call the office if anything changes.
