DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… well, the words. They do not come so easy now. I have trouble… finding them. It is most frustrating. I do not… remember when it started, exactly. Some time ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your words – trouble finding them, and it's been going on for a while. That is frustrating. To help me get a better understanding of what's happening, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, frustrating is… a good word. It is like… they are on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp them. Sometimes, when I speak… I pause. A long pause. And then… sometimes the wrong word comes out. It happens more when I am tired, I believe. Or… when I am trying to explain something complicated. I work with… compensation, yes. And benefits. And job analysis. It requires… precise language. Usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it's impacting your ability to express yourself, particularly when you're tired or trying to be precise with your language at work. That’s helpful to know. You mentioned it happens more with complicated explanations. Can you give me an example of a time recently when you noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just last week… a colleague, young man, very eager. He asked about… the new performance review system. How the ratings connect to… bonuses, yes. I knew the answer, I do. But I struggled… to explain the tiers. The… levels of achievement. I kept saying… “the thing that goes up,” and “the one that gives more money.” Very imprecise. He looked… confused. I apologized and said I was not feeling well. It was… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds really frustrating, and it's completely understandable why you'd feel embarrassed. It's good you were able to recognize it and apologize, though. Okay, so it sounds like it's affecting your work and is worse when you're under pressure or tired. Have you noticed it happening in other situations, like at home with family or friends?
PATIENT: At home… not so much. My wife… she passed two years ago. I live alone now. I have… a few friends, we meet for coffee sometimes. Casual conversation. Small talk. I do not need to be so… precise. I mostly listen. I do not… push myself to explain things. It is… easier. But I do find myself… avoiding longer conversations. Just in case. It feels safer. It is… a lonely thing, this.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your wife. That must be incredibly difficult, and I can understand why you might be feeling lonely. And it makes sense that you’d avoid conversations if you're worried about finding the right words. Okay. Let's talk a little more about your overall health. Besides this difficulty with words, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. My memory is not what it was, certainly. Small things. Where I put my keys. Names of actors in films. Nothing… serious. I thought it was just… age. I also… tire more easily now. Like a heavy weight. And… I have been a little more… clumsy lately. Tripped over the rug last week. Nothing major, just a little stumble. But I do not usually… stumble. I used to be very… coordinated.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed some changes in your memory, increased fatigue, and some clumsiness. That's good information to have. Have you had any headaches, vision changes, or weakness in any part of your body?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. A little tension sometimes, at the back of my neck. But not a proper headache. Vision… perhaps a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I thought it was just… the prescription. And weakness… no, no weakness. My hands feel… a little stiff sometimes, in the morning. But nothing… debilitating. I can still… do everything I need to do. Usually. It’s… hard to explain. A little slower, perhaps. A little more effort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some tension headaches, slightly blurry vision with your glasses, and some morning stiffness in your hands. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed… about ten years ago. I take medication for it, every day. Otherwise… nothing significant, I believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses. Chickenpox, measles… but nothing that I still… deal with. My wife… she was the one with the medical issues. I mostly… took her to the doctor. I am not very… knowledgeable about medical things. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's common to not be knowledgeable about medical things if you haven't had to deal with them much yourself. And it's good you're taking medication for your high blood pressure. Do you know what the name of the medication is?
PATIENT: …Let me see…it is a small, white pill… I take it with breakfast, every morning. The name… starts with an “A,” I think. Or maybe a “B.” It is… frustrating, I cannot recall! My wife always… managed the medications. She had a chart, very organized. I simply… take the pills she left for me. I apologize again. It is… shameful, I cannot remember something so simple.
DOCTOR: It's not shameful at all, Sherrell. It’s completely understandable, especially given the circumstances. It sounds like your wife handled most of the medication management, and it can be difficult to keep track of everything. We can look it up in your medical records here, don't worry. Okay, it looks like you're taking Amlodipine for your high blood pressure. Have you had any changes to this medication recently?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… yes, that is it! Thank you, Doctor. I am so glad you found that. No, no changes. I have been taking the same dosage… for many years, I believe. It is… a routine, really. Breakfast, Amlodipine, coffee. That is all. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I wish I could… recall more details. It is most frustrating. Perhaps… it is just age.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Sherrell. It's good to know you haven't had any changes to your medication. And it's okay to not remember every single detail. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or Alzheimer's?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother… she had heart problems, I believe. She passed away when I was young. My father… he lived a long life, very healthy. I do not… remember any other significant illnesses in my family. My wife’s family… I do not know them very well. She did not… speak much about them. There was… a great-aunt, perhaps, who had… something with her memory. But it was… long ago. I do not recall the details. It is… frustrating, I wish I could… be more helpful. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Sherrell. You've given me a lot of good information already. It sounds like there's some history of heart problems on your mother’s side, and perhaps some memory issues in your wife's family, but it’s not entirely clear. Now, let’s briefly talk about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner… on special occasions. And no… I do not use any… recreational drugs. Never have. My wife… she did not approve. I have always… been a very… moderate person. It is… a simple life, really. Quiet. Peaceful. I apologize… I do not understand why you ask. Is it… relevant?
DOCTOR: It's relevant because these things can sometimes contribute to memory problems or other health issues, Sherrell. But it's good to know that you don't smoke, rarely drink, and don't use recreational drugs. Okay. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I have never… reacted badly to any medication. I do not have… food allergies. My wife… she was allergic to shellfish. But I am not. No, Doctor. I do not have any… allergies. I apologize again for being so… unhelpful. I wish I could… recall more details. It is… frustrating. I simply… want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Sherrell. It's perfectly okay not to remember every detail. You've given me a lot of helpful information, and I appreciate you taking the time to share it with me. Okay, so to summarize, you're a 46-year-old male experiencing difficulty finding words, which has been going on for some time. It seems to be worse when you're tired or under pressure. You’ve also noticed some changes in your memory, increased fatigue, and some clumsiness. You have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with Amlodipine. You don’t smoke, rarely drink, don’t use recreational drugs, and don't have any known allergies. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like we need to investigate the cause of your cognitive changes. There are a number of possibilities, ranging from something relatively benign to something more serious. I'd like to start with a brief neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes, coordination, and basic cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam… yes, alright. If you think it is necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I simply… want to understand what is happening. I apologize… I am a little nervous. I do not… like examinations. But if it will help… yes. Please. I simply want to… get my life back, I suppose. It is… frustrating, not being able to… express myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Sherrell. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. We'll take it slow and easy. It shouldn't be painful or uncomfortable. Alright. Let's start with your reflexes. Could you please sit here on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Alright. Please, proceed. I trust your… expertise. I simply… hope it is nothing serious. It is… frustrating, this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to check your reflexes in your arms and legs. This involves tapping on some tendons with a small hammer. It might cause a brief jerk of your leg or arm, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax, and let your limbs go. Alright. And now the other leg. Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. I am… squeezing. Is that sufficient? I apologize if my grip is weak. I have been… doing less with my hands lately. It is… frustrating, losing my strength.
DOCTOR: That's good, Sherrell. It's a little less strong than I would expect, but that’s something we can investigate further. Don’t worry about it. Now, I’m going to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. I apologize, Doctor. My hand… it is not cooperating. It is… frustrating. I used to be very… coordinated. It is… concerning. Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Sherrell. Don’t apologize. It's perfectly normal to feel a little off sometimes, especially when you're nervous. We’re just gathering information at this point. Based on the neurological exam, I’m noticing some slight diminished reflexes, reduced grip strength, and some difficulty with coordination. These findings warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I’d also recommend an MRI of your brain to get a better look at your brain structure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, alright. If you think it is necessary. Blood tests, yes. Whatever you think is… best. It is… concerning, these findings. But if it will help… I suppose. I simply… want to know what is happening. I apologize… I am a little frightened. Is it… something serious? Please, tell me the truth. I would rather… know.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Sherrell, and I appreciate you wanting to know the truth. It’s too early to say definitively what’s causing these changes. These findings could be due to a number of things, some of which are more serious than others. It could be something like a vitamin deficiency, a minor stroke, or even the early stages of a neurodegenerative condition. The MRI will help us get a clearer picture and rule out more serious possibilities. I want to be upfront with you – we need to consider all possibilities, but it doesn't necessarily mean the worst-case scenario. The blood tests and MRI will give us valuable information to determine the best course of action. Okay. I’m going to write you a referral for the blood tests and MRI. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes. And blood tests. It is… a lot. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something… serious? Will there be… treatment? I apologize, I am… asking a lot. It is… frightening, this uncertainty. I simply… want to understand. And… will this affect my ability to… work? It is… my livelihood. I apologize again for being so… anxious. It is… frustrating, losing control.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid questions, Sherrell. Let's address them one by one. The blood test results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The MRI results will take a bit longer – typically 3-5 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. If it is something serious, there are treatments available for many conditions. The specific treatment will depend on the diagnosis, of course. We’ll discuss all your options thoroughly if we receive a concerning result. Regarding your ability to work, it's difficult to say definitively at this point. It will depend on the diagnosis and the severity of any condition. If you are diagnosed with something that affects your cognitive function, we may need to consider temporary or permanent modifications to your work duties. I can provide you with a note for your employer if needed, outlining any limitations you may have. I understand your anxiety, Sherrell. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to guide you through the process. Here's the referral. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. For now. I simply… want to thank you for your time and… patience. It is… frustrating, not being able to think clearly. I hope… it is nothing serious. I simply… want my life back. Thank you, Doctor. I will… schedule the tests. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherrell. Remember, I'm here for you, and we'll figure this out together. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and please try not to worry too much until we have the results. .
