DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the masks, or the protective gear they want us to wear. It's been...difficult, and I need to request an exemption, I believe is the correct term.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. An exemption related to the masks at work. I understand. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand the situation and determine if an exemption is appropriate, could you tell me a bit more about why it’s been difficult for you to wear them?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s not that I want to avoid wearing them, understand. I want to do my job and keep everyone safe. But...well, it feels like they are...closing in on me. Like they’re restricting my breathing, even though I know they shouldn’t be. It makes me very anxious, and I start to feel...disconnected, almost like I’m losing control. It’s hard to explain, but it's a very strong feeling. It started a few months ago when they first mandated them, and it hasn’t gotten any easier. I’ve tried different kinds, different sizes…nothing seems to help.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. That sounds very distressing, and it's good you're trying to address it. It’s not uncommon to experience anxiety with restrictive sensations, and it's important to take it seriously. You mentioned it started when the mask mandate began, and hasn’t improved. Has this feeling happened with anything else in your life – perhaps in other tight spaces, or with other types of clothing?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Let me think… No, not really. I’ve always been comfortable in smaller spaces, and I don’t have any trouble with clothes generally. It's specifically the masks. Before this, I never felt this way. I’ve worn hats, even things over my mouth for ceremonies, and it was never a problem. It truly seems to be isolated to these particular masks, and the requirement to wear them all day at work. It’s a bit unsettling, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Knabenshue – the fact that it’s isolated to the masks and the work requirement. It does point to something specific about that situation triggering the anxiety. Before we talk about an exemption, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you experienced any panic attacks or significant anxiety in the past, unrelated to the masks?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve always considered myself a fairly calm person. I’ve had the usual stresses of life, of course, but nothing that would be considered a panic attack or anything requiring medical attention. This mask situation is the first time I’ve felt this level of anxiety, truly. I don’t take medication regularly, and I don’t have any diagnosed mental health conditions. I’m a Protective Service Worker, so I’m usually the one helping others stay calm. This is…different. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all, Mr. Knabenshue. It takes courage to talk about these things, and it's important to remember that anyone can experience anxiety. Knowing you’re usually calm and this is new information is very helpful. To get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally in good health. I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe ten years old, but I recovered fully. I have slightly high blood pressure, which I monitor at home, but it’s usually well-controlled with diet and exercise. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses. I had a knee injury a few years back while on duty, but I’ve been through physical therapy and it doesn’t bother me much anymore. I get my annual check-ups, and the last one was normal. I am a beneficiary of Medicare, if that’s relevant. I've always tried to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Knabenshue. Thank you for sharing that information. It sounds like you are proactive about your health, which is excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I have no known allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to medications in the past. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I do sometimes get a bit of seasonal pollen allergies in the spring, but nothing serious. Just a little sneezing and itchy eyes, easily managed with over-the-counter remedies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current medications. Are you taking anything regularly, even over-the-counter vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. I take one with breakfast, mostly just to make sure I’m getting enough of the essentials. I don’t take any prescription medications currently, and I haven’t needed to in quite some time. I generally try to get everything I need from my diet, but the multivitamin is just a little insurance, I suppose. I drink coffee, of course – it’s a necessity for my job! – but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. That gives me a good overview of your medical background. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any underlying physical issues that might be contributing to your discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment. I understand the importance of ruling things out. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not drastically so. Your pulse is 78 and regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lung sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears are normal as well. I’m going to palpate your neck to check your lymph nodes. No swelling of the lymph nodes. Everything feels normal so far. Now, I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. There’s nothing physically apparent that would be causing your discomfort with the masks. Given everything you’ve told me and the results of the physical exam, it seems like your anxiety is the primary factor here.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. It’s reassuring to know there isn’t anything physically wrong. I suspected as much, to be honest, but it’s good to have confirmation. So, what does that mean for my request for an exemption? Is there anything we can do? I really do want to continue my work, and I’m willing to explore any options.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue. Given that the physical exam was normal and your history points to anxiety as the primary driver, we can explore a few options. An exemption may be possible, but it depends on your employer's policies and what accommodations they're willing to make. Before we discuss that, I want to be clear: I'm not diagnosing you with a specific anxiety disorder at this time. However, your symptoms are consistent with anxiety related to the sensation of restriction. We can approach this in a few ways. One option is to document your symptoms in detail and provide a letter to your employer explaining the situation and recommending accommodations. Accommodations could include a different type of mask, modified work duties if possible, or a temporary work arrangement while we explore further treatment options. Another option is to consider a referral to a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety. They can provide coping mechanisms and strategies to help you manage your anxiety and potentially allow you to comfortably wear a mask. A third option, depending on your employer’s requirements, would be a more formal anxiety evaluation. This would involve a more comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional. What are your thoughts on these options?
PATIENT: Those all sound reasonable, Doctor. I think the documentation and a letter to my employer is a good first step. I'm not sure I'm ready for a full-blown evaluation just yet. I’d like to see if we can manage this with accommodations first. A therapist might be helpful down the line, if needed, but I’d prefer to try the accommodations first. Would you be willing to write that letter for me, detailing my symptoms and recommending potential accommodations? I’m not sure I have the right words to articulate everything effectively. I’m also a bit concerned about how my employer will respond. They haven’t been particularly understanding about these kinds of requests in the past, from what I’ve heard from my colleagues.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Knabenshue, I'm happy to write a letter for you detailing your symptoms and recommending accommodations. That's perfectly reasonable, and I understand your concern about your employer’s response. I will focus on the functional impact of your symptoms - how they interfere with your ability to perform your job safely and effectively - and recommend accommodations that would allow you to continue working without exacerbating your anxiety. I can suggest accommodations such as a looser-fitting mask, a face shield as an alternative if permitted, or, if possible, modifications to your work duties to minimize close contact with others. I will also include a statement acknowledging that you are seeking strategies to manage your anxiety and potentially return to wearing a mask comfortably in the future. Would you like me to include anything specific in the letter?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. Yes, if you could mention that I’m a long-time employee with a good record, and that I’m committed to my work, that would be helpful. Perhaps also that I'm willing to explore different types of masks – anything that might be more comfortable. I truly appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and offer these solutions. It means a lot. Knowing I have some documentation and support will make it much easier to approach my employer. Is there anything else I need to do on my end, or any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. It's important to advocate for your health and well-being. No, there isn’t any specific paperwork you need to fill out on your end. I will prepare the letter today and have my assistant send it to you electronically. You can then forward it to your employer. I will also provide you with a list of local therapists and counselors who specialize in anxiety, should you decide to pursue that option in the future. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month or so to discuss how things are going and adjust our plan as needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. A month sounds like a good timeframe. I appreciate you providing the list of therapists as well. I’ll keep that in mind. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been incredibly helpful, and I feel much more confident about navigating this situation now. I’ll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment with your assistant before I leave. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help. Remember to prioritize your well-being, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. You have a good day as well, and please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
