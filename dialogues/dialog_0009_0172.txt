DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor… Petrimoulx, was it? Yes. Well, frankly, it’s just this… social visit. My husband insisted. Said I needed to… establish care. I just moved here, you see. From… somewhere. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright that your husband encouraged you to come in, and establishing care is a very sensible thing to do, especially with a move. We’ll take things at your pace, Candice. It shouldn’t be a long, drawn-out process. We just need to gather some basic information. You mentioned it’s a bit of a blur these days – is that related to memory concerns, or just the general upheaval of relocating?
PATIENT: Relocating, certainly. Though, truthfully, my memory hasn’t been what it once was. Not for… quite some time. It’s just… frustrating. I used to be very organized. Kept meticulous records. Now… well, now it's all a jumble. Honestly, I don’t see the point in dwelling on it. It is what it is. Are we done yet? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It’s common to experience some memory changes as we get older, and it can be very upsetting when it affects things you value, like organization. We can certainly explore that a bit further, if you're comfortable. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it's good to have a baseline understanding. Before we finish, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, dear. That’s… a lot to recall. I’ve seen doctors, of course. Throughout my life. But specifics… Honestly, I don’t believe I remember. A few aches and pains here and there, naturally. It’s part of getting older, isn’t it? I had a husband, a very good one, and we… well, we lived a perfectly normal life. Is that helpful? I really don’t think I can offer much more detail. Are you quite finished?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Candice. We'll work with what you can remember, and if you’re comfortable, we can try to access records from previous physicians. Do you happen to know where your husband took you for medical care previously?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband handles all of that. Always has. He’s very… efficient. I wouldn’t know the name of his doctor to save my life. Honestly, I've never had to concern myself with such details. He just… took care of everything. It was always easier that way. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine. A little… forgetful, perhaps, but otherwise perfectly sound.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling that everything is fine, Candice. However, even if you feel well, establishing a baseline medical history is important for providing the best possible care. It helps us to notice any changes in the future and ensures we can make informed decisions about your health. Perhaps we can start with some simpler questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness. Let me think… I don’t believe so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Though, my husband always insisted I avoid shellfish. Said it didn't agree with me. But that may have been… a precaution. He was always very cautious. Honestly, this is all rather tedious. Is there any way to expedite this process? I have a luncheon I need to attend.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Candice. We can try to keep this brief. Knowing about the shellfish is helpful. Could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, dear. That's… another thing my husband manages. He keeps everything organized in that little pill dispenser. I just… take them as directed. I couldn't possibly tell you what they are. Honestly, I don't even want to know. It's probably best not to meddle with things I don't understand. This is quite enough, don’t you think? I truly must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand this is frustrating, and it's clear your husband has always been very involved in managing your healthcare. That’s perfectly alright. In that case, perhaps we can focus on a brief physical exam today, just to get a general sense of your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose that’s… acceptable. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And no poking and prodding, if you please. I’ve never been fond of doctors’ examinations. It’s all rather… invasive. Quickly, please. I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears and throat. Then we can discuss next steps. If you could just sit back and relax… First, let’s listen to your heart. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is quite unpleasant. Are you quite sure this is necessary? My heart feels perfectly fine to me. Though, it does beat a bit faster when I’m… agitated. Which I am, at this moment. Hurry up, please. I have a luncheon. And I absolutely must be on time.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Candice. We’re just listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart rate is a little elevated, as you mentioned, which is understandable given your anxiety. I detect a slight irregularity, but it’s not immediately concerning. Let’s just check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is most uncomfortable! Are you sure you’re doing this correctly? It’s squeezing the life out of me! And that machine is making a dreadful beeping sound. My husband always said I have a low tolerance for… medical procedures. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, which can be common when feeling anxious. It’s 140/90. It's not drastically high, but it's something we should monitor. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t see the point. My ears and throat feel perfectly fine. I haven’t had a sore throat in… decades. And I absolutely detest having things stuck down my throat. It’s a most unpleasant sensation. This is quite enough! I think I’ve suffered enough indignity for one day. I’m leaving now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand you’re feeling uncomfortable, and I apologize for any distress I’ve caused. We can stop the exam if you prefer, but I do want to ensure we address your concerns. Given your memory difficulties and your husband’s involvement in your healthcare, I recommend we try to obtain your medical records from him. That will give us a better understanding of your medical history and current medications. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Well… obtaining records from my husband… that’s probably the best course of action. He knows everything, after all. Though, I do wish he wasn't so… controlling. He always insists on handling everything himself. It’s rather… exasperating. But yes, records would be helpful. Can we please just get this over with? I have a luncheon, you know. And I must be on time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. I’ll have my staff contact your husband to obtain those records. In the meantime, I’m going to write a note recommending a basic cognitive screening, just to get a baseline assessment of your memory. It’s a simple test, and it can help us determine if further evaluation is needed. Once we have your medical records and the results of the cognitive screening, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss a more comprehensive plan. .
