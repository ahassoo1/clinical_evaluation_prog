DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit… complicated. I’m here for clearance, I believe? For a surgery… a cosmetic one. I don't recall all the details, unfortunately. My husband… he arranged most of it. It was shortly after… after he passed.
DOCTOR: I see. Clearance for a cosmetic surgery arranged by your husband, shortly after his passing. That is a lot to process, and it's understandable that you might not recall all the specifics right now. Don't worry about the details at this moment. We can sort through everything. To start, can you tell me what type of surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The type… It had something to do with… my face, I think? Something about… tightening? Or lifting? It wasn't… drastic, I don’t believe. He mentioned something about making me feel… more like myself. But truly, Doctor, the specifics are… quite hazy. I apologize. It feels terribly foolish to not remember.
DOCTOR: It’s not foolish at all, Mackenzi. Grief can significantly impact memory, and arranging a surgery on top of that… it’s completely understandable. “Patient reports possible facial tightening/lifting procedure scheduled.” Let’s try this: do you recall where on your face the surgery was planned?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it involved my… forehead? And maybe around my eyes? He talked about… lines, I believe. Frowning lines, and… crow’s feet? It wasn't a full… lift, if that makes sense. Just… smoothing things out, perhaps. Oh dear, I feel like I'm grasping at straws. I really wish I could be more precise. Is there somewhere you keep records of these procedures? Perhaps the clinic has a file?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. We can definitely check the clinic records. Just one moment… Ah, here we are. It appears you're scheduled for a forehead lift and periorbital blepharoplasty – that's the medical term for eyelid surgery – on August 15th with Dr. Ramirez. The notes indicate it was primarily for cosmetic reasons, as you mentioned, to address wrinkles and drooping eyelids. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That… that does sound right. Forehead lift… eyelids… Dr. Ramirez, you say? That name… feels familiar. Yes, that all rings a faint bell. Thank goodness you found that. It’s such a weight off my mind to have something concrete. My husband was very thorough, it seems. I just… I struggle to keep things straight these days. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. It’s good we were able to confirm the details. Now that we know what we’re dealing with, we need to ensure you’re medically cleared for the procedure. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don’t believe so, Doctor. Nothing serious, at least. I get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but I wouldn’t call that an allergy, exactly. And I’m careful with what I eat. My husband was always very particular about that. Oh! Wait. I did have a reaction… years ago. To a topical cream, I think? It caused some redness and itching, but it was minor. I don't recall the name of the cream, unfortunately. It was a long time ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mackenzi. Any reaction, even a minor one, is worth noting. Do you remember what the cream was for?
PATIENT: Oh dear… It was… for my hands, I think? They get rather dry in the winter. Something to moisturize them. He bought it for me, actually. He always noticed when my skin was dry or chapped. I'm afraid that's all I can recall, Doctor. It was a small, unassuming jar. Nothing fancy. I truly wish I could be of more assistance. My memory is just… so unreliable these days. Is it alright if we perhaps check with my primary care physician? They might have a record of it?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Mackenzi. Checking with your primary care physician would be helpful. In the meantime, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve always been… rather healthy, thankfully. I don’t require much in the way of medication. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but I’ve been rather forgetful about taking even those lately. My husband used to remind me… No, nothing regular. Just the occasional multivitamin, and even those I've been skipping.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past, such as heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. I had… a bout of bronchitis a few years back. Nothing serious, it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. And I had my appendix removed when I was a child, but that was… a very long time ago. Otherwise… no, nothing major. I’ve always been quite fortunate with my health, thankfully. My husband always said I had a strong constitution. No, nothing significant. Just the bronchitis and the appendix.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you had any surgeries other than your appendectomy?
PATIENT: Other surgeries… No, Doctor. I believe that was it. Just the appendix, when I was very young. My husband would have mentioned anything else, wouldn’t he? He was very thorough about these things. No, I’m quite certain it was just the one. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a bit trickier. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And her mother… my grandmother… she had some sort of… arthritis, I think? It caused her a lot of pain in her hands. And my father… he was very healthy, thankfully. Lived a long life, no major illnesses. That’s about all I can recall, Doctor. It wasn't something we discussed frequently. My husband… he did ask, but I'm afraid my memory is a bit hazy on the details. High blood pressure in my mother, and arthritis in my grandmother, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Finally, let's talk briefly about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, perhaps. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. My husband and I… we always led a very healthy lifestyle. No, nothing like that. We preferred a quiet evening at home. A healthy diet, plenty of fresh air. That was our way of life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to make sure everything looks good before proceeding with the surgery. I'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs, and just take a quick look at your face to assess the surgical site. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement completely. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. "Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear." "Your skin looks healthy, with some expected signs of aging, as you mentioned. No unusual findings. There's some mild laxity in the forehead skin and periorbital area, consistent with your age and desired surgical outcome." "Everything looks good so far, Mackenzi. Your vital signs are stable and I don’t see any contraindications to proceeding with the surgery."
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful to hear, Doctor. Thank you so much. I was rather anxious about all of this, to be honest. I’m just… eager to feel like myself again. To put this all behind me. So… what are the next steps, if you don’t mind me asking?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, and I'm glad I could reassure you. The next step is to confirm your pre-operative instructions with Dr. Ramirez’s office. They’ll likely want you to stop taking any blood-thinning medications or supplements a week or two before the surgery, and they’ll give you specific instructions on fasting and preparing for the procedure. I'll also send a summary of our consultation to their office, including my assessment and the physical exam findings. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… Questions. Not at the moment, I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and you’ve answered all of my concerns. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll think of something later. Would it be alright to contact the clinic if that happens? And thank you again for your kindness and patience. You've truly put my mind at ease. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mackenzi. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions at all. That's what we’re here for. We’ve documented everything today – your medical history, physical exam findings, and my assessment. I’ll be sure to send that information to Dr. Ramirez’s office right away. I wish you all the best with your surgery, Mackenzi. I hope it goes smoothly and that you achieve the results you’re hoping for.
