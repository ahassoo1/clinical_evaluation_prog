DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into something... this PrEP thing. I don’t really know much about it, but she thought it might be a good idea. I’m… trying to be careful, you know? And she said this is the place to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a good thing to explore if you're concerned about HIV prevention. It’s a very effective medication. Just to be clear, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Not… regularly, but I am. And honestly, it's been on my mind a lot lately, making sure I’m doing everything I can. It’s just… a bit scary, with everything you hear. I haven’t had any issues, thankfully, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? Is that… a weird thing to say?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's very responsible of you to think ahead and want to protect yourself. Let’s go over some things to see if PrEP is right for you. First, can you tell me a little more about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Okay. Well… I mostly date men. And it’s… varied. Sometimes it’s just one-time things, sometimes it’s… a few dates. I always use protection, condoms, every time. But my friend said even with those, it’s not foolproof, and this PrEP could be extra security. She said something about needing to take a pill? Is that right? And… does it have side effects? I worry about those things.
DOCTOR: You're right, condoms are very good, but not 100% effective, so PrEP can definitely add a layer of protection. And yes, it’s a daily pill – Truvada or Descovy are the common medications. Side effects are usually mild for most people, things like nausea, fatigue, or headache when you first start. We monitor your kidney function and STI status regularly while you’re on it. Before we go further, have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. Last one was… let me think… about six months ago. Everything was clear then. I’ve also had all the usual tests, you know, for other things. I keep pretty good track of my health, so I’ve got records somewhere if you need them. I usually go to Dr. El-Masri, but she doesn't really talk about preventative stuff like this. That’s why I came here, honestly. I figured you’d be more knowledgeable about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you've been regularly tested. And you're right, preventative medicine is something I focus on. Let's see… Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I get a little nervous taking new things, but I haven’t had a proper allergy, not even to penicillin. I’ve had a few headaches with some medications, but nothing serious. And… does this PrEP show up on any tests? I don't want it interfering with anything Dr. El-Masri might do. I still see her for everything else, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good information to have. PrEP itself won’t show up on routine tests, but it is important to let Dr. El-Masri know you’re taking it, as it can affect some kidney function tests. We’ll do baseline bloodwork today to make sure you're a good candidate and that there aren't any contraindications. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I really haven’t. I’ve been… careful. Always used protection. That's why I was a little surprised my friend suggested this, but she said even with condoms, things can happen. It just… worries me, to be honest. It’s silly, isn't it? I'm 55, I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, and now I’m suddenly thinking about all this stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Trefren. It’s responsible to be thinking about this, and it’s good you’re taking proactive steps to protect your health at any age. We'll do some bloodwork, check your kidney function, and confirm you don’t have any other infections. While we wait for those results, do you have any questions for me about PrEP specifically?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes me feel a bit better. A few questions, yes. How long does it take for the pill to actually work? And… is it a hassle to get refills? I don't want to be running back and forth to the pharmacy all the time. And… what if I forget to take a pill sometimes? Is it a disaster if I miss a day? I can be a bit… forgetful, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. It takes about a week of consistent use for PrEP to reach protective levels in your body, so it’s important to be consistent. As for refills, we can typically prescribe a three-month supply at a time, and with Medicare, you should be able to use mail order if you prefer. Missing a pill occasionally isn’t a disaster, but it's important to get back on track as soon as you remember. More than two missed pills in a month can reduce its effectiveness, so we’d want to discuss that. We also have resources to help with adherence, like reminders or apps if you'd find that helpful. Before we move on, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes. And occasionally ibuprofen for a headache. That’s it. I try to stay away from medication as much as possible, to be honest. I prefer natural remedies when I can. Oh, wait… I take something for my blood pressure, very low dose. Lisinopril. I almost forgot about that. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril is good to know. It’s generally safe to take with PrEP, but we’ll want to monitor your kidney function even more closely, as both can affect your kidneys. And we’ll want to be sure your blood pressure is well controlled. Alright. Let’s go ahead and get some bloodwork drawn. It’ll check your HIV status, kidney function, and other important markers. Once we have those results, we can discuss whether PrEP is the right choice for you and how to get started. Do you have any allergies to latex or any trouble with needles?
PATIENT: No, no allergies, and I'm fine with needles. I've had plenty of bloodwork done over the years, so I'm used to it. Honestly, I'm ready to just get this over with, if that's okay. I'm not one for lingering, you know? The sooner I know what's what, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s get you over to the lab. I’ll let them know to expect you. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there a preferred number where you can be reached?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s 555-123-4567. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I still feel a little anxious, but I'm glad I came in. Hopefully, this will put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Trefren. We’ll get those results to you as soon as possible. My nurse, Maria, will be in touch. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
