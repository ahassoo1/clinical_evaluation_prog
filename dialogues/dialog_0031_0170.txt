DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out first, I guess. It's… a bit of a hassle, honestly. I just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Putney. Life insurance companies often require a medical examination as part of the application process. I’m happy to help you get this completed as efficiently as possible. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about why the insurance company requested this examination?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. The lady on the phone just said they needed some stuff checked, you know? Something about my age, maybe? I filled out a form online with all my history, but… I don't remember anything specific about why they wanted me in here. It was just… part of the process. I hope it doesn’t take long.
DOCTOR: I see. It's not uncommon for them to request a general check-up based on your age and the information provided on the application. Don't worry, we'll try to keep this as straightforward as possible. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a bit. Felt kinda funny, you know? And… I think I had some trouble with my cholesterol, but it wasn’t anything serious. They just told me to watch my diet. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and some elevated cholesterol in the past. And you mentioned you were taking medication for the blood pressure but stopped because of how it made you feel. Do you recall the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… no, sir. Not at all. It was a little white pill. That's all I remember. The lady at the pharmacy knew what I was talking about when I asked for a refill, but I don't recall the name. I stopped taking it, like I said, and haven’t really bothered with it since. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s alright that you don’t remember the specific name. It’s not uncommon to forget medication details. Stopping medication without a doctor’s guidance can be a problem, but we’ll discuss that further after I have a better understanding of your overall health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Not for anything serious, anyway. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playing baseball. But that's it. Just a cast for a few weeks. No surgeries, no major illnesses, no nothin'. I've been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Putney. No surgeries or hospitalizations beyond a broken arm as a child. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history… that's… complicated. My mom, she had diabetes, later in life. And my dad, he had some heart trouble. I think it was a stroke, maybe? It was a long time ago. A lot of my family is… back on the islands, you know? It's hard to keep track of everything. They don't always… go to the doctor either. So it's tough to say what runs in the family, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to gather accurate family history, especially with relatives living far away or not having regular medical care. Knowing about diabetes and heart trouble in your parents is helpful, though. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every now and then. I forget to take it half the time, if I’m honest. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I try to eat okay, but… you know. Life gets busy. That’s about it. Really. No pain meds, no special pills, nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an occasional multivitamin. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. No trouble with bee stings, no rashes from foods… I’m pretty good, actually. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Putney. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about some lifestyle factors. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My dad smoked, and it didn’t look good on him. Kept him coughing all the time. I stayed away from it. Always have.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes, with dinner. Maybe a couple on the weekend, if I'm with friends. Nothing crazy. Just a little something to relax. I don't drink every day, and I don't get drunk or anything. It's just… social.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional social drinking. And finally, could you tell me about your typical diet and exercise routine?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of rice, fish when I can get it. Sometimes I eat too much fried food, though. It’s good, you know? I don’t really exercise much. I used to play baseball when I was younger, but… not anymore. I walk around a bit at work, but that's about it. I sit a lot, mostly. It’s… not a very active job. Honestly, I need to do better with that. But it's hard. I just want to get this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Putney. It sounds like you have a fairly typical diet and could benefit from incorporating more physical activity. No need to feel guilty; many people struggle with that. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Get it over with. The sooner we finish, the better. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the table. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll feel your abdomen. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not concerningly so. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142/90. That is slightly elevated. Ears and nose appear normal. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses noted. Overall, the physical exam is largely unremarkable, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some basic blood work – a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. This will help us assess your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… how long will it take? I got things I gotta get back to, you know? And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, so…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Putney. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The results usually come back within a few business days, typically 3-5 days. As for the cost, because this is for insurance purposes, Medicare should cover the majority of the expense. You may have a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan. I can have the lab bill Medicare directly. We'll also get a detailed invoice for your records. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the blood work now?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Just get it done. The sooner I get this insurance sorted, the better. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I’ve just submitted the orders to the lab. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. They’ll give you instructions on how to prepare for the draw. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend making some small lifestyle changes. Try to reduce your salt intake, incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet, and aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can discuss these changes in more detail when we review your lab results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… let me know when the results are back, okay? I got a number here, if you need to call me. . And… thanks again, Doctor. I appreciate you getting this done. I really just want to get this insurance thing over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. You're very welcome. I understand your desire to get this process completed quickly. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Putney. Have a good rest of your day. .
