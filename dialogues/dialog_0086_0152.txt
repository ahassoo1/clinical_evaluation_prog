DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a little high. That’s why I’m here, I guess. It said “hyperlipidemia” but I don’t really know what that means.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia… yes, it’s a fancy word, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It is! I’m not one for all those big words. So… is that bad? Should I be worried? I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is doing a lot of work there, Ms. Geho. It can be a concern, yes. High cholesterol increases your risk of heart disease. But we need to look at the numbers and your overall health picture. Let’s start with some questions. First, when were these cholesterol levels checked, and do you happen to know what the specific numbers were—total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Numbers… let me think. The letter did have them. Just a moment… ah, here it is! Let's see… total was 240, LDL was 160, HDL was 40, and triglycerides were 180. It was checked about a month ago, at the annual check-up with Dr. Van Derlyn.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Those numbers… aren't ideal, certainly. LDL is a little high, HDL is on the low side. We need to get a better understanding of why this might be happening. Are you currently taking any medications for anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I haven’t needed anything regularly in years, thankfully. Just over-the-counter things now and then, like pain relievers for my back if I overdo it in the garden. Nothing a doctor has prescribed, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what does a typical day of eating look like for you, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch is often a sandwich, maybe with some soup. And dinner… that varies. Sometimes I cook fish, sometimes I have pasta, and I do enjoy a good steak now and then. I do like my sweets, I have to admit – a little chocolate after dinner is a habit I haven’t broken. And I drink coffee, black, all day long.
DOCTOR: So, a fairly standard diet. The chocolate and steak are… not helping, Ms. Geho. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Oh, I try to stay active! I do a lot of gardening, which is good exercise, I think. And I walk my dog, Buster, every day, usually for about 30 minutes. We go around the neighborhood. I wouldn’t say I run or anything, but I keep moving, you know?
DOCTOR: Gardening is good, walking is good… but it doesn’t always counteract a less-than-perfect diet, Ms. Geho. Do you have a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My father had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. And my mother’s brother had high blood pressure. So, it does run in the family, I suppose. I always worried about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s relevant. And what about smoking or alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life, thank goodness. And I very rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, like Christmas or my birthday. It’s not a regular thing, I promise.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. Well, Ms. Geho, your numbers are elevated, and you do have a family history. We need to investigate further. I'd like to order a more comprehensive lipid panel and check your blood sugar and thyroid levels to rule out any underlying causes. And I would like to assess your weight and height. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Weight and height is fine, I don’t mind at all. I'm quite tall, you know – almost six foot one! And I’m happy to get the blood work done. Just tell me where to go.
DOCTOR: Good. Let's start with a quick physical exam, then I’ll write you a lab order. If you'll step over here, please. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then we'll get your weight and height.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m a little nervous about all this, but I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little high. 142/92. Let's confirm that one more time. Okay, consistently elevated. Weight is 124 pounds, height is 199 centimeters, as you said. BMI is 31.2, which places you in the obese category. This, combined with your blood pressure and lipid panel, is a concern, Ms. Geho. We need to address this seriously.
PATIENT: Obese? Oh, dear. I always thought I was just… tall. I mean, I’m not round, you know? But I suppose height doesn’t change the numbers. What does this mean, Doctor? What do we do about it? My father always said I was a healthy eater!
DOCTOR: Your father’s opinion is… noted, Ms. Geho. But weight is weight, regardless of height. It means we need to implement lifestyle changes, and potentially medication, to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. Before we discuss treatment options, let’s get those lab results back to confirm everything. I’m ordering a full lipid panel, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. I’ll also add a fasting glucose test. It will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. Here is your lab order. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They will schedule an appointment for you. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I strongly recommend starting a low-sodium, low-fat diet and increasing your physical activity. I’m also going to provide you with a handout outlining dietary recommendations for lowering cholesterol. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. A lot to take in. No, I don't think I have questions right now, but I'm sure I will. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go down to the lab and schedule something. And I'll try… I'll really try to eat better. It's just… hard, you know? I'll have a look at that handout. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. It requires commitment, Ms. Geho. I expect to see improvement at your next appointment. That’s all for now. Please let my nurse know if you have any immediate concerns.
