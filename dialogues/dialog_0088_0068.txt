DOCTOR: Hello, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my leg. It’s been swelling up, you see. After… after the cancer treatments. It's mostly my right leg. It’s just… bigger than it should be.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. Swelling in your leg after cancer treatments. That’s something we definitely want to look into. When did you first notice the swelling, and has it been getting progressively worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe… a month ago? Not right after everything, but a little while after. And yes, it’s… a little bigger each day, I think. Not a lot, but… noticeable. It feels tight too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month ago, gradually worsening swelling with some tightness. And it's primarily in your right leg?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly the right one. My left leg is okay. I mean, normal. It's just... this one feels heavy, sometimes. Like I'm carrying a weight. Do you… do you need me to show you?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you’re comfortable, could you please point to the area that’s bothering you, and I’ll take a look?
PATIENT: Here. See? It’s… harder than the other one. And a bit red, maybe? I’m not sure. It’s hard for me to see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see the swelling and redness. It does feel firmer than your other leg. And I note the difference in circumference. Hmm. Do you have any pain with this swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like a really bad bruise, but not as… sharp? It aches, sometimes, when I walk a lot. And it feels warm to the touch. I don’t know if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable, like a bruise, with aching when walking, and warmth. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your cancer treatment. What type of cancer did you have, and what was your treatment regimen?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… a while ago now. It was… breast cancer. And I had… chemotherapy? And radiation. Lots of… poking and prodding. I don’t really remember all the names of the medicines. They just gave me things. I finished everything about a year ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, breast cancer treated with chemotherapy and radiation, completed about a year ago. Do you recall if you had a port placed for the chemotherapy, or if the medication was given through a vein?
PATIENT: A port? Hmm… yes, I think so. Something in my chest. They put something in before the chemo started. And they used that… to give me the medicine. I didn’t like it much, but they said it was easier.
DOCTOR: Okay, a port was used during chemotherapy. And have you had any blood clots previously, or does anyone in your family have a history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I’ve never had one. And… I don’t think so, with my family either. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had a bad knee. But no blood clots.
DOCTOR: Okay, no personal or family history of blood clots. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… just my blood pressure medicine. The doctor gave it to me after… well, after everything. And sometimes I take something for… for my arthritis. It’s just an over-the-counter thing, you know, for the pain. That's all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and an over-the-counter arthritis pain reliever. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. They always asked me, and I always said no. I've never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to check your pulses in your feet and legs, and listen to your lungs. This will help me get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s… worrying me a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. Your pulses are present and equal on both sides, which is good. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m concerned about the possibility of a blood clot in your leg, given your history of cancer, the port placement, and the swelling. While your pulses are good now, clots can sometimes be intermittent. We need to confirm this with an ultrasound. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg. It's a non-invasive test, and will show us if there’s a clot present. Would you be able to schedule that for tomorrow?
PATIENT: An ultrasound? Oh dear. Is it… is it serious? A clot? But my pulses felt okay, didn’t they? Tomorrow… yes, I suppose so. I don’t have much else planned. But… what if it is a clot?
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, it's understandable to be worried. A clot can be serious, but it’s also very treatable. The fact that your pulses are good now is encouraging, but clots can sometimes be subtle, or come and go. That's why we need the ultrasound for a definitive answer. If a clot is found, we would start you on blood thinners to prevent it from getting bigger and causing problems. We’ll discuss all the options if that’s the case. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your right leg as much as possible and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting or standing. I'm also going to order a D-dimer blood test, which can help rule out a clot, though it’s not always definitive. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood thinners… that sounds scary. Elevate my leg… yes, I can do that. And a blood test… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… please tell me if it’s bad. I don't want any surprises. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. I understand your concerns, and I will definitely keep you informed every step of the way. No surprises, I promise. We'll get these tests done and discuss the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening pain in your leg, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ve written out the orders for the ultrasound and the D-dimer test. The receptionist will schedule the ultrasound for you before you leave. I’ll also give you a printout with instructions on elevating your leg. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
