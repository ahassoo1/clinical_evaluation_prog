DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Oh, this cough… it’s been bothering me for a good long while now. Just a dry tickle, mostly. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… scratchy. I don't really know why it's happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dry, scratchy cough for a while now. That’s good to know. And it doesn’t produce any mucus or phlegm?
PATIENT: No, no phlegm. Just… dry. Like something’s stuck in my throat, but it isn't. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. I used to chew on some herbs, back home… but I can’t quite remember what they were. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. Worse at night is helpful to know. And you mentioned using herbs previously – do you remember anything specific about them, like what they looked like or how they tasted?
PATIENT: Hmm… They were… green, I think. Small leaves. And a little bitter, but not too bad. My wife… she always knew which ones to use. She made a tea, mostly. I just… followed her instructions. It was a long time ago. Everything gets a little blurry. I can’t quite recall where we even got them from, to be honest. Just… from the garden, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, green leaves, a little bitter, made into a tea… that’s a good starting point, even if it’s not super specific. It sounds like you've tried some home remedies before, which is good. Let's talk a little more about the cough itself. Besides being worse at night, have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well… Dust makes it worse, I think. When I was still working on cars, you know, all that metal dust… terrible for it. That's why I had to stop, really. Couldn't breathe. But now… I mostly stay inside. Doesn't seem to matter much these days. It’s just… there. It doesn't really get better, just… less noticeable sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dust definitely aggravates it, and it doesn’t seem to improve much on its own. Have you had a fever, chills, or any shortness of breath with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills. I get a little winded sometimes, walking up the stairs… but I just figured that’s old age catching up with me. Not really short of breath, just… tired. It's hard to tell what's the cough and what's just… being ninety years old, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It can be hard to separate things out when you’ve lived a long life. No fever or chills is good. Let’s do a quick exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I haven’t had much trouble with doctors over the years, but my wife always said it was best to be careful. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… deep breath in… and out. Your lungs sound a little bit clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing, especially on exhale. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 88, but that could be from a little anxiety or just being in the clinic. I also notice you're a little underweight, Brodie. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? I hadn't noticed. Just felt tired, like I said. Ninety years old, you know… things just start to creak. And… yes, I suppose I have lost some weight. Not a lot, but… my clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t been eating much lately. Just… not much of an appetite, I guess. Everything tastes a bit… bland. My wife used to make the most wonderful food.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight loss and decreased appetite can be concerning, especially with the wheezing and low oxygen. It could be a number of things, and we need to investigate a bit further. Given your age and symptoms, I think it would be a good idea to get a chest X-ray to rule out any potential issues like pneumonia or chronic lung disease. We should also check a blood test to look at your overall health and see if there’s any sign of infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood test… Seems… thorough. I don’t mind, Doctor. If it helps figure out what’s going on, that’s good. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded too much. And I don’t have any insurance, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Brodie. We can definitely work with you regarding the cost. We have options for self-pay patients, and we’ll do our best to find a solution that works for you. The X-ray is pretty quick and painless, and the blood test is just a small prick – it’ll be over before you know it. I want to be thorough just to make sure we're not missing anything. Given your history and symptoms, it could be something relatively minor, or it could be something that needs treatment. Would you be able to get the X-ray and blood work done today at the clinic, or would you prefer to schedule it for another day?
PATIENT: Today… if that’s alright. I’d rather just get it over with, you know? The waiting is always the worst part. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I don’t get around as easily as I used to. And thank you for working with me on the cost, Doctor. That’s a big relief.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brodie, that's perfectly fine. We can get that started right away. I'll have my nurse, Lisa, come in and draw your blood first, and then we’ll head over to the X-ray room. It shouldn't take too long at all. Lisa is very gentle and efficient, and the X-ray technician is also very good. We'll make sure you're comfortable the whole time. Let me just quickly write the orders for the blood work and X-ray. While we're waiting for the results, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just getting to the bottom of this cough is enough for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. My wife… she always knew the best doctors. I hope I can find one as good as her. Just… let me know when I need to go for the tests.
DOCTOR: It’s my pleasure, Brodie. And I assure you, you are not “just an old man.” You deserve the best care, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. And it sounds like you had a wonderful wife – it’s always nice to hear about strong relationships. Okay, Lisa should be in any minute to draw your blood. She will explain the process and answer any questions you have. Then we’ll go for the X-ray. Let’s get started, then. And don’t hesitate to let me or Lisa know if you're feeling uncomfortable at any point.
