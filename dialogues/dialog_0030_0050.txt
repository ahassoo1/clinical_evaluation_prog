DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. Well, it’s this cough. Been… bothering me for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Feels like something’s tickling my throat, but nothing comes up. Hard to say how long, exactly. A good spell, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for a “good spell,” you said. Let's try to narrow that down a bit, if we can. Roughly, would you say weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I think. Maybe… six months? It comes and goes, you see. Worse in the mornings usually, and when the weather changes. I don't rightly remember when it started, but it’s been a good while. My memory… isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Pavlovic. Six months is helpful. And it's good you’ve noticed it's worse in the mornings and with weather changes. Has anything else changed along with the cough?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I get a little more tired, I suppose. But I’m ninety years old, so… that could just be old age catching up with me. I don't get any fever or chills. And I ain't lost any weight, not that I've noticed. My appetite's still pretty good, thankfully. Just… tired, sometimes. And the cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or weight loss, and you’ve noticed some increased fatigue. That’s all good information. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. I get a little winded when I’m doing things, but that’s normal, isn’t it? I don't think I’ve ever wheezed. And no chest pain, thankfully. Just this… irritating cough. Feels like dust in my throat, mostly. There. Like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never have. Never liked it. My wife, she tried it once or twice, a long time ago, but I didn’t allow it in the house. No, never smoked. My father neither, for that matter. Clean living, we always said. Well, as clean as a farmer can get, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you been exposed to any dust, mold, or fumes recently – perhaps from work around the farm or in the house?
PATIENT: Fumes… well, I used to work on cars, back when I was younger. Automotive repair, that was my trade. Lots of fumes then, of course. But that was… oh, goodness, sixty years ago? More? And the farm… just normal dust from the fields, I suppose. Nothing special lately. We haven't done much farming these last few years. My son helps out some, but mostly it's just kept tidy. Does that matter? All that old car work?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Mr. Pavlovic. That history of automotive work could be relevant. I want to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any heartburn or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Heartburn… hmm. Sometimes, yes. A little bit. Mostly after I eat. Spicy food usually sets it off. It ain’t too bad, though. Just a little burning in my chest. I take some antacids sometimes, and that usually helps. Nothing to make a fuss over, really. Old age, probably. Everything aches and burns a little bit when you get to be my age.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… just those antacids, when I need 'em. And a little bit of ibuprofen for my knees now and then. Arthritis, you see. Otherwise, no. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. My wife always said they’re more trouble than they're worth. She was a practical woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and antacids. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have – to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of, no. Never been much bothered by allergies. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I’m out in the garden, but I figured that was just the plants. No real bad reactions to anything, thankfully. My wife had a bit of a dust allergy, but I didn't inherit that, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen levels, and take a look at your throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My lungs… haven't been what they used to be, I reckon. But do what you need to. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Excellent. I’m hearing some mild wheezing, mostly on exhale, and slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally. Now I'm listening to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but a bit on the slower side, which isn't uncommon at your age. No murmurs detected. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the lower end of normal. Your throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. That gives me a little more information.
PATIENT: So, what does that mean, Doctor? Diminished breath sounds… that doesn’t sound good. Is it serious? And 92%… is that bad? I’m not too worried about my throat, as long as it’s not the coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovic, let's go through this together. The diminished breath sounds and mild wheezing suggest there's some narrowing of the airways, possibly from mild inflammation or some degree of airway obstruction. This, combined with the 92% oxygen saturation, suggests your lungs aren’t quite as efficient at getting oxygen into your bloodstream as they could be. It’s not immediately alarming, but it’s something we need to address. Given your age, history of automotive work, and symptoms of a chronic cough and fatigue, my initial thought is that you may be experiencing some degree of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. This is a common condition in former smokers and those with long-term exposure to irritants like dust or fumes. It’s often a gradual process, and the symptoms can develop slowly over time. However, to confirm this, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, or PFT. The X-ray will give us a better look at your lungs to rule out any other causes for your symptoms, and the PFT will measure how well your lungs are functioning. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: COPD… that sounds… serious. Automotive work… so it could be from all those years breathing in those fumes? I suppose that makes sense. A chest X-ray and a test… yes, yes, of course. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then let's do it. I just want to know what's going on, and what we can do about it. I don't want to just sit here and cough and get weaker. So, yes, let’s get those tests done. How do we go about doing that?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic, I understand. It’s good that we’re being proactive. We can schedule those tests right here at the clinic. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and get you scheduled for a chest X-ray first thing tomorrow morning, and then we'll schedule the pulmonary function test for the following week. It will involve breathing into a machine for a short period of time, and it’s completely painless. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you start using a bronchodilator inhaler twice a day. This will help to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a commonly used medication for COPD and can provide significant relief. I’ll write you a prescription for albuterol, which is a short-acting bronchodilator. I will also advise you to avoid any irritants that might worsen your symptoms, such as dust, smoke, and strong fumes. And it's important to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Albuterol… that’s a mouthful. And a inhaler… I haven’t used one of those since I was a young man, working on cars. So, the inhaler and avoiding dust… and then the tests. Is it okay to still go out and do a little bit of gardening? I like to keep busy, you see. And what if I forget to take the inhaler? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. And… is this COPD something I'll just have to live with? It just seems like a lot to take in all at once.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Pavlovic. It is a lot to take in, and it’s good you’re asking. First, the albuterol inhaler. Sarah, my nurse, will demonstrate how to use it properly before you leave today, and we have written instructions as well. It's important to get the technique right to ensure you're getting the medication effectively. Regarding gardening, you can still garden, but I would recommend wearing a mask, perhaps an N95 mask, to minimize your exposure to dust and pollen. And avoid working on dry, windy days. If you forget to take the inhaler, don't worry too much. Just take it as soon as you remember. We're aiming for twice a day, but missing a dose occasionally isn't the end of the world. We can also discuss strategies to help you remember, such as setting a reminder on your phone or associating it with another daily routine. As for COPD… yes, it's often a chronic condition, meaning it doesn't usually go away completely. However, with proper management – including the inhaler, avoiding irritants, and staying active – many people with COPD can live full and active lives. It’s about controlling the symptoms and preventing them from getting worse. We'll monitor your condition closely with the tests, and we can adjust your treatment plan as needed. I also want to emphasize the importance of pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program of exercise and education designed to help people with COPD improve their breathing and quality of life. Do you feel a little better understanding those points?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that helps a lot. A mask for the garden… that’s a good idea. And the reminder on my phone… my son could help me with that. He’s good with those things. And knowing it can be managed… that’s a relief. I don't want to just sit here and cough myself to bits. Pulmonary rehabilitation… that sounds like a good idea too. I still try to stay active, you see. I walk a little bit every day, when the weather’s good. So, let's get this chest X-ray done, and then we'll talk about this rehabilitation program. I reckon I can manage all this, with a little help. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little bit.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m glad I could help. I'm confident you can manage this. Sarah will be in shortly to schedule your chest X-ray and give you instructions on how to use the albuterol inhaler. She will also provide you with some information on pulmonary rehabilitation programs available in the area. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. I appreciate your patience and explaining everything so clearly. You’ve been very kind. I’ll see Sarah now, and we’ll get this X-ray scheduled. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You take care, and we'll see you soon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
