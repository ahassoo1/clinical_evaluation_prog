DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… concerning. I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly, but more often now. It worries me, because my blood pressure is… not good. I want to be clear about everything, if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Clarity is… desirable. We’ll get to the bottom of this. "Forgetting things," you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes. It is difficult to explain. I remember… appointments, dates, very clearly. But… where I put my keys, or… the name of a neighbor’s dog. Things like that. Yesterday, I made tea, and completely forgot I had made it until I smelled it later. It is… unsettling. I do not like to be forgetful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. So, not a loss of significant memories, but more… recent events?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Significant memories are… intact. I remember my husband very well, my childhood… everything. It is just… the little things. And it is happening more frequently. It started slowly, perhaps six months ago, but now… it is almost daily. It makes me… anxious.
DOCTOR: Anxious is… understandable. And you mentioned your blood pressure is not good. Are you currently taking any medication for that, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Amlodipine, I believe it is called. Five milligrams, once daily. And… Lisinopril, ten milligrams, also once daily. I take them every morning, with my breakfast. I have been on them for… almost ten years, now. But sometimes, I forget if I actually took them, and have to check. Which is… ironic, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Sometimes, I feel… a little clumsy. I bumped into a doorframe last week, which is… not usual for me. And my vision… it is sometimes blurry, even with my glasses on. But I thought that was just… getting older. Perhaps it is all connected? I do not know. It is all… very worrying.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision and clumsiness… interesting. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally, a mild one. Nothing severe. Dizziness, yes, sometimes when I stand up too quickly. And… no, my speech is alright, I think. No one has said anything. But… sometimes, I struggle to find the right word. It is not frequent, but it happens. Like… the tip of my tongue, but I cannot grasp it. It is… frustrating. Do you think it is my blood pressure medicine?
DOCTOR: It’s… possible. Medication side effects are always a consideration. But these symptoms could be indicative of several things. We need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any family history of memory problems or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… she had dementia, in her late eighties. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had… strokes, I believe. It was many years ago, I do not remember the details very well. But it was… serious. He could not speak after, and needed… care. It is a frightening thought, naturally. It is why I am here, Doctor. I do not want to… become like them.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Given your family history and your symptoms, we’ll need to run some tests. I’d like to start with a basic neurological exam, and then order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. We should also get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Are you able to schedule an MRI appointment this week?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, I suppose I can. It is… a bit frightening, but if it is necessary, I will do it. This week is… difficult. I have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday, and a luncheon on Friday. Thursday afternoon might be possible. But I must check with my neighbor, she drives me. Is that alright? Do you… need any other information? I just want to get this… sorted.
DOCTOR: Thursday afternoon will suffice. I’ll have my assistant schedule it for you. We'll need a detailed list of your current medications, and any allergies you may have. Also, do you drink alcohol, Ms. Alvara?
PATIENT: Alcohol… very rarely. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, once or twice a month. Nothing more. I prefer tea, honestly. And… no allergies, as far as I know. I have never had a reaction to anything. I will… make a list of my medications. Just to be sure. Is there anything else I should do? Should I… keep a diary of my forgetfulness? It sounds… rather silly, but I am willing to do anything that might help.
DOCTOR: A diary is… not entirely useless, I suppose. Note the time, what you were doing, and the specific nature of the forgetfulness. It might provide some pattern. For now, let's focus on the MRI and the blood work. My assistant will give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. We'll review the results together in about a week. Don’t… jump to conclusions. It could be something relatively benign. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… everything, I think. Thank you for your time. I will… speak with my neighbor about the MRI. And I will make the list, and try to remember everything. I appreciate your… thoroughness. Hopefully, it is nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: We shall see. My assistant will be with you shortly. .
