DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, it’s this… shaking. It’s just… annoying, okay? It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… well, it makes things hard. Don’t know why I even bothered coming in. Probably just old age, right? Is that what you’re gonna tell me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. It’s certainly valid to feel annoyed by something that interferes with your daily life. And while age can be a factor in certain conditions, it’s important to understand why you’re experiencing this shaking, regardless of age. It's good you came in. Could you describe the shaking to me in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail do you want? It shakes! It's not like I’m doing a dance or something. It happens when I try to… hold things. Like a fork, or a newspaper. Sometimes just when I'm sitting still, it twitches. It’s been… a while, I guess. Hard to say exactly. Everything feels like a long time these days. Look, I used to be a director, you know. Big movies. Don't have much use for steady hands now, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's impacting your ability to perform everyday tasks, and that's concerning. So, it occurs primarily when you're attempting to do something – holding objects, for example – and also sometimes when you’re at rest. You mentioned this has been going on for a “while.” Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate? Honestly, doc, I don't keep track of these things. Maybe… a year? More? Less? It started gradually, you see. I just noticed it getting worse. My wife, God rest her soul, she kept telling me I should see someone. I put it off. Always busy. Always something more important. Now… well, now it’s just a nuisance. And truthfully, I haven't got the energy to sit here and dissect the timeline of my tremors, if that’s what you want.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Baide. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have a precise timeline. We can work with “about a year” as a starting point. And I appreciate you finally coming in, despite being busy. Now, besides the shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get tired, if that counts. Old age, again. And… sometimes I feel a little stiff. My hands, mostly. And my legs. But that’s probably just from… not moving around enough. Look, I don’t go to doctors, alright? I used to direct people, not be the patient. This whole thing is… irritating. Just tell me if it’s something serious or not, and let me get out of here.
DOCTOR: I understand your aversion to being a patient, Mr. Baide, and I will certainly try to be as efficient as possible. The stiffness you're experiencing – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly in the mornings. I wake up feeling like a rusty gate. It loosens up after I… well, after I get moving. But it’s there, alright? And sometimes I feel… unsteady. Like I might fall. Not often, but it happens. Look, is this getting us somewhere or are we just playing twenty questions? I've got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Baide, and I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. It’s important to gather as much information as possible. The unsteady feeling you describe – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? It’s… hard to explain. Like my balance is off. I don't stumble exactly, but I feel… wobbly. Especially when I turn my head. It’s not every time, but it’s enough to make me cautious. And frankly, it’s embarrassing. A director shouldn’t feel like he’s going to fall over. It's… undignified. Honestly, I just want a simple answer. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, based on what you’ve described – the shaking, stiffness, unsteady balance, and the feeling of wobbliness when turning your head – it sounds like we should investigate the possibility of Parkinson’s disease, or a related condition. However, these symptoms can have other causes as well, so it’s important not to jump to conclusions. Would you be comfortable if I conducted a brief neurological examination?
PATIENT: Parkinson’s? What?! I don't want Parkinson’s! That’s… that’s a terrible disease! My… my uncle had that. Spent his last years… well, it wasn't pretty. No. Absolutely not. I don't need an examination. I just wanted to know if it was something serious. You’ve told me it might be a terrible disease. That's enough. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, please, allow me to explain. Saying “it might be” is simply acknowledging a possibility based on your reported symptoms. An examination is not to confirm a diagnosis, but to gather more information and rule out other causes. We can then determine if further testing – such as imaging or blood work – is necessary. I understand your fear, and I assure you, we will proceed at your pace. However, avoiding a proper assessment won’t change anything, and it could potentially delay appropriate care if it is something that requires attention. Even if it isn't Parkinson's, there could be other, more easily treatable causes for your symptoms. Would you be willing to let me perform a simple balance and coordination test?
PATIENT: Balance and coordination test? Look, I’ve directed hundreds of people, alright? I know balance and coordination. I don't need you testing me. This is ridiculous. I’m wasting my time here. And frankly, you’re upsetting me. I’m leaving now. Don’t call me. Don’t send me bills. I’ll… I’ll figure something out.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your distress, and I respect your decision. I won’t press the matter further. However, I strongly encourage you to reconsider, even if just to rule out other possibilities. I will ensure you receive a detailed summary of our conversation, and I’ll flag your chart with your concerns. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Here is a referral to a neurologist, just in case. It’s better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it. Thank you for your time, Mr. Baide. I wish you all the best.
