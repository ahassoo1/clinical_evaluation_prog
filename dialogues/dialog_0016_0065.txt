DOCTOR: Hi Reneisha, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re 41. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Yes, that is correct. I am here because… well, I’ve gained a rather significant amount of weight, and I haven’t altered my routine. It’s quite perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A significant weight gain without changes to your routine is worth investigating. To get a better picture, could you tell me about how long you've noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It began… approximately six months ago, I believe. Perhaps a little less. It was gradual at first, barely noticeable, but it has become… more pronounced in the last three months, certainly. I weigh myself every week, you see, and the numbers… well, they haven’t been favorable.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months with acceleration over the last three. And you said you haven’t changed anything about your diet or exercise habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I prepare my meals at home, mostly traditional Lithuanian fare, as I have for years. My husband and I walk our dog every evening – about thirty minutes, brisk pace. It’s… it’s very unsettling. I’ve always been quite disciplined with my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Traditional Lithuanian fare…and a consistent 30-minute walk. To help me narrow things down, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: That is a good question. Yes, actually. I… I have been feeling more fatigued lately. Not constantly, but… a sort of heaviness, a lack of motivation. I attribute it to the summer heat, perhaps, but it has been persistent enough to mention. It’s not debilitating, but… noticeable. Also, I've been sleeping… rather deeply, I suppose. More than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and deeper sleep. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes, actually. I… I have been rather… constipated, lately. It is not something I typically discuss, but it has been ongoing for several weeks now. I have tried increasing my fiber intake, but it hasn’t provided much relief. It’s… uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation despite increased fiber intake. And have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… my skin does seem drier than usual. And my hair… I suppose it is a bit more brittle, falling out a little more when I brush it. Nothing dramatic, but I’ve noticed it. I usually have quite healthy skin and hair. I attribute it to good genes, mostly. It's... frustrating to have so many little things changing at once.
DOCTOR: Alright, dry skin and brittle hair along with the weight gain, fatigue, deeper sleep, and constipation. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been remarkably healthy, all my life. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing of that nature. I see my dentist regularly, and I had a routine check-up with my primary care physician last year, which was unremarkable. My blood pressure is always excellent, and my cholesterol is… well, within normal limits, as far as I recall. I take no medications, currently.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No past medical history, no surgeries, no medications. What about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she suffered from diabetes, type two, later in life. She was diagnosed in her sixties. And my father… he had high blood pressure, but it was well-managed with diet and exercise. No other significant illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I am aware. Mostly… longevity. They both lived well into their eighties.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of type two diabetes and hypertension. And you mentioned you prepare your meals at home. Can you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Certainly. For breakfast, I usually have a small bowl of oatmeal with some berries and a dollop of plain yogurt. Lunch is often a potato pancake – cepelinai – with a side of sour cream and a small salad. Dinner varies, but typically includes boiled potatoes, some form of meat – pork or chicken – and steamed vegetables. I use very little salt, and I avoid processed foods entirely. I drink mostly water, and occasionally a cup of herbal tea. I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, as a treat, but it’s… small. I try to be very mindful of my portions.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a generally healthy diet, though potato-heavy. Let's move onto a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… perfectly acceptable. I understand it is necessary. Please, proceed. I hope it will shed some light on this matter. I'm growing rather anxious about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’ll check your vital signs. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6. That’s all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I'll also palpate your thyroid gland. Thyroid is normal, no nodules or enlargement detected. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and look at your skin. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Skin is dry, as you mentioned, with some mild edema in the lower extremities. Overall, the physical exam is relatively unremarkable, except for the dry skin and mild edema. However, the edema is concerning, given your other symptoms. It could be related to kidney function or heart health.
PATIENT: Edema? That is… unsettling. I hadn’t noticed, precisely, but my ankles do feel a little swollen in the evenings. Is that… serious, Doctor? I am quite concerned about my kidneys. My mother also had some… issues with fluid retention later in life. What do you suggest we do next? I would like to ascertain the cause of this quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and it's good you mentioned your mother's fluid retention. The edema, along with the weight gain, fatigue, constipation, and dry skin, is raising a flag for a possible thyroid issue – specifically, hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid. To investigate this further, I'd like to order some blood tests. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, as well as free T4. We may also want to check your vitamin D level. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, absolutely. Please, proceed with the tests. I would greatly appreciate a definitive diagnosis, and if hypothyroidism is the cause… I trust there is treatment available? I am eager to understand what is happening and begin addressing it. The sooner, the better, frankly. I simply wish to return to my normal self.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Hypothyroidism is very treatable with synthetic thyroid hormone replacement. It’s a common condition, and most people respond very well to treatment. Okay, I'll get the lab order sent to the front desk. They'll schedule you for blood draw. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms – like difficulty breathing, chest pain, or significant swelling – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have addressed all of my concerns. I appreciate your thoroughness and your calming manner. I will await the results with… anticipation. Thank you for your time and your attention to this matter. I suppose I shall see you again in a few days? .
DOCTOR: Yes, you will. I will have the nurse contact you once the results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Reneisha. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
