DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor... Vodzak, yes? It's... nice. I think. I just... moved here. New place. That’s why I am here, I guess. Social thing, they said. For old people. Medicare sent me. Don’t remember much else.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare sometimes encourages new patients to establish care with a primary physician when they relocate. That's very sensible. It's good you're doing that. And don’t worry about not remembering specifics; we’ll take things at your pace. So, Mr. Szmyd, putting the 'social thing' aside for a moment, are you experiencing any health concerns at all?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Hmm. I work with faces all day. Makeup, you know? For the theater. Sometimes long hours. Back gets a little... stiff. But that's normal. Old age, probably. I don’t feel sick. Not really. Just… tired, I suppose. Everyone is tired these days. Is that a concern?
DOCTOR: Working with faces for the theater sounds fascinating! And it’s not uncommon to feel tired, especially with long hours. However, fatigue can be a symptom of several things, so it’s good you mentioned it. Let's talk about the back stiffness a little more. Where exactly is the stiffness?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the theater. It's... demanding. The stiffness... it's mostly lower. Lower back. Sometimes goes down the leg a little. Not all the way, just... feels tight. Like I've been bending over too long. Which I have, I suppose. Holding mirrors, adjusting lights... you know. It's not painful, painful. More... annoying. And it gets worse if I sit for too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back stiffness radiating slightly down the leg, worsened by sitting. That gives us some helpful information. Have you ever had this happen before, or is this a new issue?
PATIENT: New, I think. Oh, maybe a little when I was younger. Lifting heavy things. But nothing like this. This… stays. It doesn’t go away, even with rest. Not completely. Used to be, a good lie-down, that would fix it. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when you say it "stays," roughly how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... since I moved here, I guess. About… three months? Maybe four. It's hard to remember. Everything is a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months of lower back stiffness, radiating down the leg, not fully relieved by rest. To get a better understanding, and rule out anything serious, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your reflexes, range of motion, and some pressure points. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Examination? What kind of examination? I don't like being poked and prodded. And I don't want any… tests. I don't do well with tests. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. The examination is quite simple and non-invasive – just a few gentle checks to see how your back and legs are functioning. It will help me understand the source of your discomfort and determine if any further investigation is needed. It's mainly to rule out anything that needs immediate attention, like a pinched nerve. We don't have to do any tests right now, not at all. We can discuss those later if I feel they are necessary. But the examination will give me a much clearer picture. It shouldn't be uncomfortable, and I will explain everything I'm doing as I go. Would you be willing to try it?
PATIENT: A pinched nerve, you say? Is that… bad? I don't like the sound of that. And you promise it won't be… painful? I don't want any surprises. Fine. But be gentle. And explain everything. I don't like being kept in the dark.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for trusting me, Mr. Szmyd. A pinched nerve can be uncomfortable, but it’s often treatable with conservative measures like physical therapy or medication. And I absolutely promise to be gentle and explain every step of the way. First, I’m just going to have you lie flat on your back on the examination table. We'll start there. And please, tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. We can stop at any time. Would you like assistance getting onto the table?
PATIENT: Flat on my back, you say? Like an old fish. Fine. No, I can manage. I'm not completely helpless. But don't expect miracles. My bones aren't what they used to be. Just… don’t rush me. And be prepared for a lot of groaning. There. Now what?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Just relax as much as possible. I'm going to gently press on a few different points along your spine to check for tenderness. It won't be a deep, hard push, just enough to feel for any areas of discomfort. I will also check your reflexes in your legs and ask you to move them in a few different directions. Let's start with your lower back. I’m just going to touch here… and here… Any discomfort with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, there. That's… tender. Not terrible, but definitely there. Like a dull ache. And… a little bit to the right. Yes, right there. It feels… tight. Like a knot. A very annoying knot. Be careful, Doctor. Don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side of your lower back, with a feeling of tightness. Noted. Now, I'm going to gently bend your leg up, and then ask you to lower it slowly. This tests the strength and flexibility of your leg muscles and checks for any nerve compression. Any pain or discomfort as I lift your leg?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… not comfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… tight. And a little bit of… tingling. Down the back of my leg. Yes, there. Just below the knee. It’s… strange. Like pins and needles. Not constant, just… comes and goes. Don't push it, Doctor. I don’t want to feel anything sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling down the back of your leg when lifting it, felt just below the knee. Noted. That’s helpful information. Now, I’m going to have you try to push your foot down against my hand, and then pull it back up. Just try to push as hard as you can.
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s… weak. It’s not as strong as it used to be. And it feels… stiff. Like I haven't used it in a while. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do so much more. There. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, some weakness and stiffness in your foot. Thank you. Now, just one more quick thing. I’m going to gently touch along the back of your leg to check your reflexes. It's just a little tap with this small hammer. Hmm. A slightly diminished response on the right side. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Szmyd. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – tenderness in your lower back, tingling down the leg, weakness and stiffness in your foot, and a diminished reflex – it sounds like you may have some nerve compression in your lower back, possibly related to a disc issue or some arthritis. However, to confirm this, we would need to get some imaging done, such as an X-ray or MRI. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Nerve compression… disc issue… arthritis… Ugh. It all sounds terrible. Imaging? Like… pictures of my bones? I don’t like the sound of that. Is it necessary? Is it painful? I don't want to be poked and prodded again. And… expensive? I just wanted a simple check-up. Now you're talking about pictures and… things. This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. It is a lot to take in. The imaging, specifically an MRI, would allow us to see exactly what's going on in your lower back and identify the source of the nerve compression. It's not painful at all – you just lie still in a large tube for about 30 minutes. It's a bit noisy, but otherwise very comfortable. As for the expense, Medicare typically covers the cost of medically necessary imaging. We would verify your coverage before scheduling anything, so you wouldn’t be surprised by any unexpected costs. We don’t have to do the imaging right now. We could start with some conservative treatment – physical therapy, medication for pain and inflammation – and see if that helps. However, without knowing the exact cause of the problem, it’s difficult to say how effective that would be. It’s really up to you. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… medication… that sounds… less scary. But you said without knowing the cause, it might not work? Ugh. It's always something. Fine. Let's try the therapy and medication first. But no promises. And if it doesn't work, I don’t want any pressure about the… pictures. And… who does the therapy? Is it… young people? I don’t want some young person telling me what to do. I've been living a long time, I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s a perfectly reasonable approach, Mr. Szmyd. We can definitely start with physical therapy and medication. And don't worry, we’ll find a therapist who is experienced and a good fit for you. I can provide you with a list of highly-rated therapists in the area, and we can discuss their backgrounds and specialties before you make a decision. We'll make sure you're comfortable with your choice. I’ll write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and inflammation. It's important to take it as directed and let me know if you experience any side effects. I will also give you a referral to physical therapy. They'll assess your condition and develop a personalized exercise program to strengthen your back and core muscles and improve your flexibility. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… try to find an old therapist. Someone who understands… things. And no surprises, Doctor. I don’t like surprises. And… how long until I start feeling better? I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I will make a note to recommend therapists with more experience. I understand your concern about finding someone who is a good fit. As for how long until you start feeling better… that’s a difficult question to answer. It really depends on the severity of the condition and how well you respond to treatment. However, with consistent physical therapy and medication, many people experience significant improvement within a few weeks. We’ll monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Here is the prescription for your medication, and the referral to physical therapy. Please call the physical therapy clinic to schedule an appointment at your convenience. I'd like to see you back in four weeks to assess your progress. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms before then, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m good. Just… thank you, Doctor. I guess. Hopefully, this will all work out. And… try to remember the old therapist thing, okay? Alright. I’m going now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. And yes, I’ll definitely remember the preference for an experienced therapist. We’ll do our best to find someone who is a good fit for you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in four weeks. .
