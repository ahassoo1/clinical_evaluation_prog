DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I’m really busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "straight to it" it is. I pulled up your lab results from August 1st. To be clear, these are for a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, ordered after your initial consultation… do you recall why those were requested?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I do. I remember you wanted to check… everything, basically. Just to see if the fatigue had a cause, right? I was pretty tired for a while there, and you wanted to rule things out. I don't need a full explanation of why we did them again, just what they showed.
DOCTOR: Yes, precisely. Fatigue. Right. Well, your complete blood count came back within normal limits – no anemia, no signs of infection. Your basic metabolic panel… your electrolytes are all normal, kidney function is fine, blood sugar is also within normal range. Frankly, it's… unremarkable. Which, unfortunately, doesn’t give us a clear answer as to why you’re feeling fatigued. Sometimes, these things are hard to pinpoint. Have you made any changes to your lifestyle since we last spoke?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Hmm. Not really. Work's been the same, eating habits are normal… I've been trying to get more sleep, but it hasn't really helped. Honestly, that’s why I was hoping the tests would show something. This is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's always easier when there's a definitive answer. “Normal” tests can be… less helpful, but they do rule out a lot of serious possibilities. When you say "normal eating habits," could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Usually, I grab something quick for breakfast – like toast and coffee. Lunch is usually a sandwich or salad, whatever’s easy to take to work. And dinner… varies. Sometimes I cook, sometimes it’s takeout. I try to eat vegetables when I can, but honestly, I don't really track anything. Nothing drastically different than usual, though. I don't drink a lot of soda or anything, mostly water.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a fairly standard diet. And you mentioned trying to get more sleep – what does that look like?
PATIENT: It means I try to be in bed by 10pm most nights. But I still toss and turn a lot, and I don’t always fall asleep right away. I wake up feeling… not exactly rested, even if I get eight hours. It’s hard to explain. It's just not deep sleep, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Not deep sleep.” Right. Well, that’s… subjective. And difficult to quantify without a sleep study, which, frankly, is likely not necessary at this point. Sometimes, fatigue is simply… a result of stress and overwork. Have you considered whether your workload is manageable, or if there are other factors contributing to your stress levels?
PATIENT: Stress? Of course I’m stressed! I have a job, don’t I? Everyone’s stressed. That doesn't explain why I feel completely wiped out all the time. I’m starting to think something’s actually wrong and these tests just… missed it. I’m a logistics person, Doctor, I deal with details. And something doesn’t add up.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your frustration, truly. But it's important to remember that tests aren’t always conclusive. We've ruled out a lot of serious medical causes. It’s possible this is… functional. I can refer you to a therapist if you'd like. Sometimes, addressing underlying stress and anxiety can significantly improve energy levels. Otherwise, I recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle – diet, sleep, exercise – and we can re-evaluate in a few months if things haven’t improved. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A therapist? Seriously? Look, I appreciate you ruling things out, but I don’t think this is just in my head. I need something more concrete than “manage your stress.” Are there any other tests we could do? Anything at all? I'm not leaving here until we explore every possibility. I’m a very detail-oriented person, and I need more information before I just accept "functional fatigue."
