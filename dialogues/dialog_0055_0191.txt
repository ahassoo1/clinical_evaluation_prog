DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 64 years of age. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that's right, sixty-four. Well, to be frank, I came to ask about getting tested for… for HIV. It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while now, and I thought it was best to just get it done and know for sure.
DOCTOR: HIV testing, you say. Very well. While I find it… unusual for someone your age to be considering this without a clear reason, I suppose it is your prerogative. Before we proceed, can you tell me what prompted this concern?
PATIENT: Unusual? Oh, dear. Well, it's not that I’ve done anything, if that's what you mean. It’s just… my husband, Bartholomew, he's been feeling unwell lately. Very tired, losing weight… and I read an article, you see, about how some symptoms can be… similar. I just want to be sure, for both of us. It’s better to be safe, isn’t it? I haven't mentioned it to him yet. I wanted to get some information first.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern for your husband, Ms. Shaub. However, those symptoms – fatigue and weight loss – are rather nonspecific and can be indicative of a multitude of conditions. Still, prudence is… acceptable. Before we proceed with any testing, let’s gather a bit more information. Have you or your husband engaged in any behaviors that might increase your risk of exposure?
PATIENT: Oh my. Behaviors? I… I don't quite understand. What sort of behaviors are you referring to, Doctor? Bartholomew and I have been married for forty years. We are… devoted to one another. I’m not sure what you mean by “risk of exposure.” We’ve always been… careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I simply adhere to a thorough medical history. When I refer to “risk of exposure,” I am inquiring about any instances of unprotected sexual contact, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions prior to 1985. It is standard practice to explore all possibilities, however… unlikely they may seem in your situation. Let us focus on your husband’s symptoms for now. When did he first begin experiencing fatigue and weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no drug use, Doctor. Never. And as for… other things, well, we haven’t… we haven’t had cause for concern in many years. As for Bartholomew, he started feeling tired, I’d say… around March, maybe April. At first, we thought it was just the change in weather, you know? But it hasn’t gotten better. He's lost… I don’t know, perhaps ten pounds? He used to be so strong. It worries me greatly. He brushes it off, says he’s just getting old, but I know something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Ten pounds, you say. And fatigue. I see. Has he experienced any fever, night sweats, or unexplained rashes?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. Not that I've noticed, anyway. And no rashes. He does say he feels… warm sometimes, but he also says it's just the weather. We live in a rather old house, you see, and it gets stuffy. He’s been a bit more… irritable lately, if I’m honest. Not like himself at all. He used to be such a cheerful man. He does have a bit of a cough now and then, a dry cough, but it comes and goes. Is that… is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Irritability and a dry cough… those could be attributable to a number of factors. However, given your concerns and his weight loss, a basic examination is warranted. Let’s begin with his vital signs, and I’ll listen to his lungs and heart. Afterwards, we can discuss some basic blood work to rule out more common ailments. I'm still unsure why you're fixated on HIV, but we will address all of your worries. If you'll please step onto the scale, Ms. Shaub.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. I just want to know what’s happening with Bartholomew. I'll step on the scale now. It's just… he’s my whole world, you see. Forty years… it feels like a lifetime. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. Now, if you’ll please have a seat on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. I'm detecting some mild wheezing… not overly concerning, but we will note it. And your heart rate is slightly elevated, though that could be due to your anxiety.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Anxiety, you say? Yes, I suppose I am a bit anxious. It’s just… waiting, not knowing… it’s terribly unsettling. Is the wheezing… is that serious, Doctor? Should I be worried about that too? I’ve never had any trouble with my breathing before.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shaub, I assure you, mild wheezing is rarely a cause for immediate alarm. It could be a simple sign of a mild respiratory irritation. However, to be thorough, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. These tests will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help rule out any underlying causes for your husband’s symptoms. As for your… concerns regarding HIV, we can discuss testing options after we have reviewed the results of these initial tests. I will have the lab order sent to the front desk. They will schedule you for an appointment to have the blood drawn.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Yes, a complete picture is always best. I understand. Blood work and an X-ray. And then we can talk about… everything else. Thank you. I suppose waiting is all I can do for now. Please, let me know as soon as you have the results. I’m terribly worried about Bartholomew.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. The lab should contact you directly to schedule your appointment. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you with any pertinent findings. In the meantime, I advise your husband to maintain a healthy diet and get plenty of rest. And please try to… manage your anxiety. It will not assist the situation. Are there any further questions I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't believe so. You've been very thorough. I appreciate your time and… your patience. I’ll wait for the lab to call. Thank you again. I just hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Shaub.
