DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Good to meet you… I suppose. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Ruocco, if you don’t mind me saying, I’d prefer to not take up too much of your time. But… it’s my breathing. When I lie flat, it gets… difficult. Like something is pressing on me. It’s been happening for… oh, maybe a month now? A month and a week, perhaps. It’s quite bothersome when I try to sleep.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Right. And it's specifically when you lie flat?
PATIENT: Yes, specifically. If I sit up, or even lean back a little, it’s fine. But the moment I try to lie completely flat… it feels like I’m… well, like I can’t get enough air. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a heavy feeling. Do you understand? I don’t have much experience explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Heavy feeling… Alright. And has this… “heavy feeling” been getting worse?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe it has. At first, it was just a little uncomfortable. I could mostly ignore it. Now… now I have to prop myself up with several pillows just to be able to sleep at all. It’s been a real nuisance, to be perfectly honest. And I’m terribly tired, naturally. Do you need me to describe the pillows? Three, usually. Sometimes four.
DOCTOR: Pillows… Right. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the breathing. No coughing, no chest pain, no swelling in my feet… nothing like that. I did feel a bit… lightheaded once or twice, but that could just be from not sleeping well. Honestly, Doctor, I don't usually bother people with minor things. It's just… this is starting to interfere with my sleep. And a good night’s sleep is important, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any… heart issues in the past?
PATIENT: Heart issues? No, not that I’m aware of. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a bit of trouble with his blood pressure, but I’ve always been quite healthy. Regular check-ups, sensible diet… the usual. I had my gall bladder out years ago, but that was a very simple procedure. Do you need a list of all my medications? I have it written down, if it helps. It's not a very long list, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No, no. Medications aren't… usually relevant in cases like this. Alright. Let’s just… have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I’ve always listened to my mother. She was a very sensible woman. And my husband, he smoked a pipe, but only after dinner. Very mild, and he never bothered anyone with it. So, no, I haven’t smoked. Do you need to know about alcohol? I have a small glass of sherry with dinner sometimes. Very small.
DOCTOR: Right. Sherry. Look, Mrs. Vanderwiele, I'm going to listen, but frankly, this sounds… I don't know. Let me just… can I listen to your chest?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out, if possible. I have a library book due next week, and I’d like to be able to concentrate on reading it, rather than worrying about my breathing. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Deep breath... exhale. Hmm. Sounds… clear. A little diminished, perhaps, but clear. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. It feels… normal. A little pressure, naturally, but nothing uncomfortable. I’ve always had a strong back, you know. I used to help my father with the garden, lots of bending and lifting. Built up the muscles, I suppose. Are you finding something? Is it something serious? I really do need to get back to the library…
DOCTOR: Well, frankly, it's probably just… positional. Fluid build-up. Happens sometimes. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, just to be safe. It’s likely nothing, but it’s best to rule things out. Don't get alarmed, it's a standard procedure. The nurse will schedule that for you. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. An X-ray. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose I can manage that. Though, it does seem like a bit of a fuss over a little breathing trouble. Very well. I’ll see the nurse, then. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I do appreciate you seeing me. .
