DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh… well, it's a bit embarrassing, actually. I’m having some… pain. Down there. In, um… that area. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, but it’s gotten worse recently. I'm not quite sure what is going on, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to be a bit embarrassed discussing these things, Ms. Stepro. Many women experience similar issues. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring. Let me see… it’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s… uncomfortable. It feels… heavy, almost. And… is it normal for it to sometimes feel… warm? I can’t quite explain it. It's been hard to concentrate, if that makes sense. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it's becoming difficult.
DOCTOR: A dull ache, coming and going, with a sensation of heaviness and sometimes warmth… and difficulty concentrating. Thank you for sharing that detail, Ms. Stepro; that's helpful. To clarify, where exactly are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It’s… down there, like I said. It's… around my… well, the area with the… you know. The parts a man would have. I feel it in that general region, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly where. Sometimes it feels more on one side than the other, but it's… vague. I hope that makes any sense at all. I'm truly sorry I can’t be more specific. It's just… I don't really know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. It can be difficult to describe these areas. You’ve given me a good general idea. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger this pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I recall, really. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. It's… my livelihood. Perhaps that has something to do with it? I’m on my feet all day, and sometimes I’m lifting heavy things. But I haven’t had any injury or anything. It just… started gradually. I suppose I've been more stressed lately, too. Running the shop alone is… demanding. Could that be it? I'm not sure. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Woodworking and being on your feet all day, and increased stress… all relevant information, thank you. Stress can certainly contribute to various types of discomfort. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous surgeries or significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was quite young, I believe. And… I've had the usual things, colds and flu. Nothing major, really. I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but they haven’t found anything concerning. I have Medicare, so I get all the standard tests. As for significant conditions… I don’t think so. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I may be forgetting something. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about? It's been a long time...
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, and regular check-ups with no concerning findings… That’s good to know. No need to worry about recalling everything perfectly; we can review your records as well. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medications that you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, to my knowledge. And… medications. Let me see. I take a multivitamin, that’s all. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, you know. Nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. Does that help? I hope I'm not forgetting something important. It’s just… everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis… That's helpful information, Ms. Stepro. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit fuzzy; we'll take our time. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That’s a tricky one. My parents are both… were both from Colombia, and… well, we didn’t talk about medical history much. It wasn’t really a thing in our family, you see. I know my mother had… arthritis, like me. And my father… I think he had high blood pressure, but I’m not entirely sure. I have a brother, but we haven’t spoken in years. I honestly don’t know anything about his health. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… I don’t have much information to offer. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. It’s very common for family medical history to be incomplete. We’ll work with what you have. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, and no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with a special meal, once or twice a year. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m a very healthy person, generally. I eat well, I try to get enough sleep, and I stay active with my woodworking. I take pride in taking care of myself, you see. It’s just… this pain is very worrying. It’s not like me to have these kinds of problems.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Stepro. It sounds like you prioritize a very healthy lifestyle. That’s very positive. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve some gentle palpation of your abdomen and pelvic area. It's to help me better understand the source of your discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. I would like to know what's going on, so yes, please. I hope it won't be too… unpleasant. I must admit, I’m a little nervous. But I trust you to be gentle. Just… let me know what you're doing as you go, if you don't mind? It always makes me feel better to know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stepro. I will explain everything as I go and ensure your comfort throughout the exam. Please let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m starting by gently pressing on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain in this area?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Right there, on the left side. It’s not sharp, but it’s… a dull ache, like I described. It feels… deep. And… is it normal for it to feel… a little warm to the touch? It's hard to explain. It's not excruciating, but it's definitely not comfortable. It feels… different than just a normal ache. I hope that makes any sense. I feel a bit silly trying to describe it. I’m not very good at this, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly alright to not be good at describing it; that’s what I’m here for. I’m noting the tenderness on the left side, and I do detect a slight warmth in that area. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your pelvic area. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort here.
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That’s… more uncomfortable. Right there, on the right side. It’s… a sharp twinge, actually. Not constant, but when you press there, it’s quite noticeable. And… it feels… a little swollen, perhaps? I’m not sure. It’s hard to tell. It’s not like anything I’ve ever felt before. Is that… normal? I’m starting to get a little worried now. It feels… different than the ache in my abdomen. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I apologize for being so anxious. I just… I don’t like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepro. Thank you for letting me know. I’m noting the sharp twinge on the right side of the pelvic area, and your observation about possible swelling. It’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, and you are not overreacting. Based on the exam, I am detecting tenderness and possible inflammation in both the left abdomen and the right pelvic area. Given the sharp twinge and your description of possible swelling, I would like to order some imaging to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m thinking a pelvic ultrasound and potentially a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Imaging… that sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment. I just… I want to know what's going on. I don’t want to keep wondering and worrying. Ultrasound and CT scan… yes, please. Is it… a painful procedure? I’m a little nervous about that, too. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a woodworking order I need to finish, and I don’t want to delay it too much. But my health is more important, of course. I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’m a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Stepro. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to address them. The ultrasound is non-invasive and doesn’t involve any radiation. You’ll lie on a table, and a technician will move a probe over your abdomen. It shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some pressure. The CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a low dose and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help improve the image quality. I’ll write the orders for the imaging now and the radiology department will schedule you for the scans as soon as possible. Typically, we receive the results within 24-48 hours. Once I have the results, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, or bleeding, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. Non-invasive ultrasound… that’s reassuring. And I understand about the CT scan, if it’s necessary. 24-48 hours… that’s not too bad. And I will definitely go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I… I appreciate your patience with me. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, and I’m a bit out of practice. I hope I haven’t been too much trouble. And… thank you for listening to my concerns. It makes me feel a little better, just knowing that you’re taking me seriously.
