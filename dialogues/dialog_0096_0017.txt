DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, good to see you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Good to see you too, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Well, it’s this… tryout. For the… team. You know, the sports. I need to be sure I’m… allowed. It’s a formality, really. My… ex-wife thought it was a good idea. Though why, I don't know. She always had… opinions.
DOCTOR: A sports team, right. And this is a medical clearance you need?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s it. A clearance. To make sure I’m not… falling apart. Not that I feel like I’m falling apart. Though my knees… well, they make noises. Old noises. Like a rusty gate. Does that matter? It’s probably just… age.
DOCTOR: Well, "old noises" can certainly be… informative. Let’s start with a bit more detail. What kind of sports team is this for, and what sort of activities will be involved?
PATIENT: Hmm. Sports… It’s… uh… Well, it’s… with the… the older folks. It’s not like… professional. It’s… softball, I think. Or maybe… kickball? Something with a ball. And running. There's running involved. Not much, I hope. Mostly just… standing around and… occasionally hitting things. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. My ex-wife signed me up. She’s very… enthusiastic.
DOCTOR: Right. So, recreational softball or kickball, with some running. And you're saying this is primarily to satisfy your ex-wife?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A formality! She thinks it will be “good for me.” All this… exercise. I used to be strong, you know. Back in the day. Did… construction. Heavy lifting. But that was… a long time ago. Now I mostly… sit. Does sitting cause problems? I wouldn't be surprised. It’s a terrible posture, I’m sure. And probably weakens the… the muscles. Though, truthfully, I feel fine. Mostly. The knees, of course. And sometimes… a little shortness of breath. But that's the heat, I think. It's been very warm.
DOCTOR: "Mostly fine" isn't quite a diagnosis, Mr. Bartok. Let's go through a few things systematically. Have you had any chest pain, dizziness, or palpitations – that's a racing heart – with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Racing heart…? Hmm. I… I don't know about racing. It… beats, of course. Doesn’t everyone's? Sometimes it feels… fast after I climb the stairs. But that’s just… being out of shape, I assume. And dizziness… not really. Maybe a little lightheaded if I stand up too fast. But that’s been happening since I was young. Nothing to worry about, I'm sure. It’s just… old age again. Everything aches, everything feels a bit… wobbly. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “aches and wobbles” are… common, as you say. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… Let me see. High… blood… something? My doctor… back in… Connecticut, I think, mentioned something about my numbers. Not being… ideal. But I don’t remember exactly what he said. He used a lot of… fancy words. And diabetes… I don’t think so. My ex-wife is very health-conscious, she would have said something. Arthritis… possibly. My hands get stiff sometimes. Especially in the cold. But I just thought it was… the weather. Everything’s the weather these days. What was the doctor’s name? Dr. Feldman… maybe? It was a long time ago. I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: So, you’re not certain if you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure or arthritis, and you don't recall the specifics of any previous treatments?
PATIENT: Well, I think he said something about blood pressure. Pills, maybe? I vaguely remember taking… something. A small, white pill. But honestly, Doctor, it was years ago. And I don't like taking pills. They make me… feel strange. As for arthritis… it’s just a little stiffness. Like being old. I've always had… creaky joints. It’s probably nothing serious. My ex-wife tends to… exaggerate things. She worries too much. Can we just… get this over with? I have a… a television program I like to watch.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, this isn’t simply a formality. You’ve mentioned potential high blood pressure, arthritis, and a vague recollection of medication. Before I can clear you for any physical activity, I need a more complete picture. I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam and order some basic blood work. If you’ll just step over here…
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More… things? Very well. My ex-wife is going to be thrilled. This is all her fault, you know. All of it. Just… please be quick. And try not to poke too much. It… it hurts, you know. Old age. It's a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Bartok. And again… I'm hearing a slight… wheezing. Now, I’m going to listen to your back… Any pain here?
