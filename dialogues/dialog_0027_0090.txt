DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I… I believe I’m here for a check-up before a surgery. A cosmetic surgery, that is. Honestly, the details are a bit… fuzzy. My husband arranged everything, and… things have been difficult since he passed. I just want to make sure I’m healthy enough to proceed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It’s very common for things to be a bit unclear during… difficult times. A pre-operative assessment is a good idea. So, the surgery is cosmetic, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It's… something I discussed with my husband. He felt it would… improve my confidence. It's to do with… well, my stomach. I’m not entirely sure what the procedure is called, to be honest. Would that be on the paperwork he filled out? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Let me take a look… yes, here we are. It says abdominoplasty – a tummy tuck. And a little bit of liposuction around the flanks. Okay. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your overall health, just to get a clearer picture?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please do. Ask whatever you need to. I'll do my best to answer, but… please forgive me if I stumble a bit. My husband usually handled all of this.
DOCTOR: Of course. No problem at all. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My husband always said I was very healthy. I did have… a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully. And, oh! I had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, maybe… fifteen years ago? Other than that… I can’t really recall anything significant. I did have the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing that required ongoing treatment, I don’t believe. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Pneumonia and gallbladder removal are good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Just this, I think. A multivitamin, and… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but only when I really need to. Otherwise, no, not really. My husband always insisted I try natural remedies first. He was very… holistic.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was ages ago, and I haven't had it in years. I suppose it’s possible I have a mild sensitivity to something, but nothing that would require an EpiPen or anything like that. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, briefly, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my parents both passed away a long time ago. They lived in Colombia. I don't… I didn't have a very close relationship with them, truthfully. And my husband… he was an only child, and his parents are also gone. I don’t really know much about their medical histories, I’m afraid. We didn’t discuss it often. I believe my father had some issues with his heart, but I don’t know the specifics. I wish I could be more helpful, but… my memory is just so fragmented. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. It’s understandable. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, just a couple of lifestyle questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My husband was very against it. He always said it was terrible for your health. I don’t even like the smell of it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing excessive. Perhaps a glass or two a few times a week.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about alcohol – a glass or two a few times a week. Now, before we move on, let me ask about your weight. Have you experienced any significant weight changes recently?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I have lost a little weight since my husband passed. I haven’t been eating as well, and… I’ve been very preoccupied. It’s probably not much, maybe five or ten pounds. It’s hard to say exactly. I haven’t really been keeping track. I'm sorry, I know I'm not being very precise. It's just… everything feels a bit blurry at the moment.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Brightful. It's understandable. Now, can I ask about your current symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Nothing major. I have a bit of fatigue, but I think that's mostly due to stress and lack of sleep. I haven’t been sleeping very well since… since my husband passed. And sometimes I get a little shortness of breath when I exert myself, but again, I think that's probably just from being out of shape. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some shortness of breath, and general aches and pains. And do you have any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? No, not exactly. Not a sharp pain. Sometimes I feel a little… discomfort. A tightness, perhaps. It comes and goes, and it’s not very severe. I just assumed it was stress. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And is this tightness related to exertion, or does it happen at rest?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s more noticeable when I’m doing something. Like… climbing the stairs, or carrying groceries. If I’m sitting still, I don’t really notice it. It's not a constant thing, though. It comes and goes, as I said. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine for days. Is this something serious, Doctor? I'm starting to get a little concerned.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to be thorough, do you notice any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. I thought it was just from sitting for too long. It's not severe, Doctor, and it comes and goes. It's more noticeable at the end of the day, after I've been on my feet. I haven't paid much attention to it, honestly. I assumed it was just… normal. Is that something I should be worried about too? It feels like a lot all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Okay, some swelling in the legs and ankles, and chest tightness. Ms. Brightful, given your symptoms – the chest tightness, shortness of breath, and swelling – and the recent change, I want to be cautious. It’s possible this could be related to your heart. I would like to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG… and a chest X-ray…? Is it… serious, Doctor? Is something wrong with my heart? I haven't had any chest pain, really. Just that tightness. And the swelling… I just thought it was age. Yes, please. Order the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I'm starting to get very frightened. Is it alright if I call someone to come with me?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It’s wise to have someone with you. It’s good we’re checking these things out. The tests will help us determine what’s going on. An EKG is a simple test that measures your heart’s electrical activity, and the chest X-ray will allow us to see your lungs and heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something seriously wrong, but it’s better to be safe and rule out anything concerning. I will have the nurse come in and get you set up for those tests right away. Is there someone you'd like to call?
PATIENT: Yes, please. There's a neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez. She's very kind. Her number is… 555-123-4567. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I was starting to feel very anxious about all of this. I suppose we should hold off on discussing the surgery for now, then? Until we know what's going on with my heart?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Let's focus on getting these tests done and finding out what's going on. The surgery can wait. Your health is the priority right now. I'll have the nurse come in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you've answered everything. I'm just… a little scared, to be honest. But I trust you. Thank you for being so thorough and… kind. I hope it's nothing serious. That’s all. I think I'll just sit here and wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: Of course. Take a deep breath, Ms. Brightful. We'll do everything we can to figure this out. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
