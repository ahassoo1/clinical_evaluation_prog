DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Versace, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter just thought I should… get checked out. She worries too much, that girl. I feel fine, mostly. Just…old, I suppose. It’s been a while since I had a proper doctor, you know? Not since… well, never mind. It doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Old” is a rather vague symptom, Ms. Calvery. And while a concerned daughter is… admirable, it’s best if you tell me what, if anything, is bothering you. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, difficulty sleeping, or anything else that’s different than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All that! Well… my appetite's been a bit off, I think. Not much of an appetite, really. Everything just tastes…blender, you know? Like mush. And sleeping… hmm. I do wake up a lot. But who doesn’t wake up when they get to be my age? It’s just…part of it. I don’t know about pain… aches and creaks, sure, but that’s just…being alive, isn't it? Honestly, I'm not sure what she told you I was here for. She makes a big deal out of everything.
DOCTOR: “Blender,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, blender! Like everything's been… pureed. No flavor, no texture. Just…smooth. It's hard to explain. It started a few months ago, I think. Or was it last year? Time just…goes. It’s not painful, mind you, just…unpleasant. I used to love a good kimchi jjigae, you know? Now…it all tastes the same. Like baby food. Honestly, it’s probably just my tastebuds giving out. Old age, right? It happens.
DOCTOR: Well, taste changes can be a normal part of aging, yes. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. Have you noticed any nasal congestion, sinus pressure, or a decrease in your sense of smell?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Smell? I don’t really pay attention to smells. I mean, I know when something’s burning, of course. And the kitchen always smells like garlic, thanks to my daughter. She’s a good cook, but…a bit heavy-handed with the aromatics. Congestion… sometimes, maybe? I get a little stuffy in the winter, but that's just the cold air, isn't it? Honestly, Doctor, I think my daughter is sending you on a wild goose chase. I’m perfectly fine. Just…old. And a little tired of bland food.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. While I appreciate your… resilience, we're going to do a quick exam just to be thorough. It's a standard procedure. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a quick look at your throat and sinuses. It won’t take long. Can you step up onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Fine, fine. But don’t expect much. I’m just a regular old lady. Scale, you say? Honestly, I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My daughter has one at home, but I avoid it. Numbers are just depressing at my age. Lead the way, Doctor. But be gentle, alright? My joints aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just stand still, please. 103 kilograms. And your height is listed as 174 centimeters. That puts your BMI at… well, we’ll discuss that later. Now, if you'll just follow me to the examination room. We'll take a look at your throat and sinuses. Please sit on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, 103 kilograms, is it? Well, I have always been a bit…solid. It runs in the family, you know. My mother was a…robust woman. Don't worry about the numbers, Doctor. I'm not planning on running a marathon. This table is rather cold, isn’t it? And hard. My daughter always has a nice, padded chair for everything. But go ahead, Doctor. Poke and prod away. Just be quick about it, alright? I have a mahjong game scheduled for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Open your mouth and say "Ah." Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Your throat appears slightly inflamed, and your breath sounds a little… congested. But nothing too alarming. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your sinuses. Tell me if you feel any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, “Ah.” Is that good enough? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t know what you’re looking for. It feels like you're just poking around. Ouch! Yes, that’s a little tender… right there. On the left side. It's been a bit achy lately, now that you mention it. But it's nothing… probably just a cold. Or the weather. Or… something. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to aches and pains. They come and go. Are we almost done? This table is really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a simple sinus infection. The inflamed throat and sinus tenderness are consistent with that. However, the change in your sense of taste is concerning enough that I’d like to order a few tests just to rule out other possibilities. We'll do a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your sinuses. We should also get a referral to an ENT specialist. They can evaluate your taste changes more thoroughly. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests? A CT scan? An ENT specialist? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting a bit… dramatic, isn’t it? All this for a little ache and a bland taste in my mouth? My daughter is going to be thrilled. She always thinks I’m on the verge of collapse. I just wanted a check-up, not a full-body investigation. I suppose if you think it’s necessary… but I really don’t like being poked and prodded. And a CT scan sounds…expensive. Is my Medicare going to cover all this? Honestly, I’m not sure I want to go through all this trouble just to find out I have a common cold.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns. However, it’s my responsibility to investigate any potential health issues thoroughly. The CT scan should be covered by Medicare, but we’ll verify that with the billing department. As for the ENT specialist, they are the experts in conditions affecting the nose, throat, and taste. I’m not trying to scare you, but it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially given your age and the persistent change in your taste. We’ll start with the blood work and CT scan. If those results are inconclusive, then we'll proceed with the ENT referral. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work and a scan, then we’ll see. But if it turns out to be nothing, you're hearing from my daughter. She’s very… thorough when it comes to complaining. And I still think it’s probably just my taste buds giving out. Where do I go for the blood work? And how long will this scan take? I have mahjong on Wednesday, you know. And I always win. Honestly, I hope this doesn't interfere with my winning streak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the orders for your blood work. You can go to LabCorp, located at 123 Main Street. They’re open until 5 PM today. As for the CT scan, it will be at the Imaging Center, located at 456 Oak Avenue. It usually takes about 30 minutes, plus some time for preparation. We'll schedule that for tomorrow morning, if possible. I’ll have my nurse schedule those appointments for you before you leave. We’ll get the results back within a few days. I’ll call you as soon as we have them. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, 123 Main Street, you say? That’s near the bakery… I might have to stop for a cream puff afterwards. And 456 Oak Avenue… hmm. Well, as long as it doesn't interfere with mahjong. Thirty minutes, you say? That’s a long time to be lying in a scanner. Honestly, I hope they have a comfortable blanket. And please tell my nurse to schedule the scanner for as early as possible. I need to get home for my tea. You don’t think it’s anything serious, do you? I mean, really? You're not trying to scare an old lady, are you?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I am not trying to scare you. It is simply my job to rule out any potential issues. Given your change in taste and the inflammation I observed, it's prudent to investigate further. The tests will help us determine the cause and ensure you receive the appropriate care. I can't give you a definitive answer right now. We need the results of the tests first. My nurse will schedule those appointments for you and answer any further questions you may have. She’s much better at soothing anxieties than I am. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
PATIENT: No. I suppose not. Just… get it over with, then. And tell your nurse to be gentle with the scheduling. I have a busy week, you know. Mahjong, gardening, afternoon tea… a lady has priorities. I’m sure it’s nothing. Just old age. Everything aches, everything tastes bland… it’s the natural order of things. But fine. Tests, scanners, specialists… whatever. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long. I need my tea. Can I go now? This is all very exhausting. Mahjong… must win mahjong…
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, you can go now. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule your appointments and answer any questions you may have. I’ll have her come in right away. Please, let me know if you experience any worsening symptoms before your appointments. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery. And… enjoy your tea. Mahjong… really?
