DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Eaddy, you say? Well, it's...a pleasure, I suppose. My daughter, she said I should come. She worries too much. I just...need a little card. A "Get Well" card, maybe? Or one that says something nice. You know, encouragement. I'm not sick sick, just…feeling low.
DOCTOR: A card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a card. From a doctor. It would mean something, you see? People don't just say things anymore. A nice, official card…shows you care. My ex-wife…she never sent me a card. Not once. But that's another story. A "Get Well" card would be fine. Or something about…staying strong. You know what I mean?
DOCTOR: I understand you'd like a note from me for encouragement. While I am happy to provide reassurance, my role as a physician is to address medical concerns. Perhaps we could discuss what is making you feel “low” so I can better understand if there's something we should be addressing from a health perspective?
PATIENT: Health perspective? Look, I'm a simple man, Doctor. I operate boilers, I don't have a health perspective. It’s just…things. Life. My daughter thinks I’m depressed, but I’m not depressed. I just…feel old. And things remind me of…well, never mind. A card would just be nice. Is that so much to ask? You're a doctor, people listen when you say something.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate your directness, feeling “old” and experiencing difficult emotions can be indicators of underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even early stages of cognitive decline. It is my professional responsibility to investigate these possibilities, even if you don't believe a medical issue is present. Could you describe what you mean by "things reminding you"?
PATIENT: Cognitive decline? Now you’re just being ridiculous. I remember perfectly well how to operate a boiler, thank you very much. Been doing it for thirty years. Thirty years! And I can still tell you the capital of Puerto Rico. San Juan! See? Perfectly fine. “Things”… well, my wife, she passed five years ago. And… things around the house. Her garden. I haven't touched it since. It's all overgrown now. And my son… he doesn’t call much. Just… things. But it doesn't mean I’m sick, Doctor. It just means life is…hard sometimes. Still, a card…
DOCTOR: I understand you've experienced a significant loss with the passing of your wife, and it's natural to feel sadness and experience changes in your routine. It sounds like you're dealing with a great deal of emotional weight. Before we discuss a card, would you be willing to answer a few brief questions about your overall health?
PATIENT: Brief questions? Alright. But don't expect me to start listing symptoms. I'm not sick. I just… want a card. Fine. Ask your questions. But if you start talking about…feelings again, I might just leave. I operate boilers, remember? I don't do feelings.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start simply. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat. Sometimes more, sometimes less. Depends. If my daughter cooks, I eat more. She makes a good arroz con gandules. Weight… I don’t weigh myself. Never have. What does it matter? I’m a big man. Always have been. Still am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? I sleep. Usually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Thinking. About things. The garden, mostly. Or… old times. But I get back to sleep eventually. I’m not one of those people who stays awake all night. I need my sleep. Operating a boiler is hard work, you know.
DOCTOR: Do you experience any pain, anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, my back aches sometimes. But that’s just…old age, I suppose. I used to lift heavy things at the boiler plant. Heavy pipes, heavy valves. It just…aches. Nothing a little rest doesn’t fix. And my knees. They creak. Like an old door. But what old man doesn't have creaky knees? It's just part of getting older, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration lately, aside from thinking about the garden?
PATIENT: Concentration? Look, I can still remember every valve and pipe in that boiler plant. Every single one. And I can still tell you the difference between a forced draft and a induced draft. So don't tell me my concentration is bad. As for memory... well, sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. But who doesn't? It's just… old age. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to talk about a card or just keep grilling me about everything? I came here for a card!
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I see from your records that you have a history of hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Your last blood pressure reading was slightly elevated. Sometimes, medications can have side effects that affect mood and memory. Also, uncontrolled hypertension can also cause cognitive changes. While I understand your desire for a simple note, I would like to take a moment to check your vitals and perform a brief cognitive assessment. It's a standard part of a medical evaluation and can help us rule out any underlying issues contributing to how you're feeling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lisinopril? Oh, that little pill. My daughter makes me take it. Says it’s good for me. I don't feel any different. And a cognitive assessment? What is that? Sounds…complicated. Look, I just want a card. A simple "Get Well" card. From a doctor. Is that too much to ask? You're making this very difficult, Doctor. Very difficult indeed. I operate boilers, not… brain tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your overall well-being. A cognitive assessment is a simple series of questions that help evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It doesn't involve any complex procedures or tests. It's a way to make sure everything is functioning as it should. And regarding the card, I am more than happy to provide a note once we have completed a basic assessment. I want to ensure you're receiving the best possible care, and that includes addressing any potential underlying health concerns. It will only take a few minutes. Would you be willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright. Just… get it over with. But if it takes too long, or involves anything complicated, I’m leaving. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Just…ask your questions. And then give me the card. A simple "Get Well" card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Uh… August… the second? Yes. August the second. 2025. Is that right? My daughter told me. She worries about these things.
DOCTOR: Good. And what city are we in currently?
PATIENT: City? Uh… well, it’s a small town. Rural, you said? I… I don’t really pay attention to city names. I just know where the boiler plant is. And my daughter’s house. Is that… is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Let's try something different. Can you repeat these three words for me, and I'll ask you to recall them later?
PATIENT: Three words? What words? Fine. Give me the words. But if they're complicated, I'm not repeating them. I operate boilers, not…word games.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those three words. We’ll come back to them shortly. Now, let’s move on to a simple math problem. If you have five apples, and you give two away, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Five apples… give two away… hmm. Let me see… five take away two… is that… three? Yes. Three apples. I think. I used to be good at math. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Do you recall them?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm… Apple… I remember apple. And… something with a table? I think. Was it a chair? No, a table. And… something shiny? A coin? A… penny! Yes, I think so. Apple, table, penny. Did I get them right?
DOCTOR: You recalled two of the three words correctly, Mr. Kammer. That's good. Now, let's move on to naming as many animals as you can in one minute. Don't worry about being perfect; just say whatever comes to mind. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Animals? In one minute? This is ridiculous. I operate boilers, not… name animals. But fine. Fine, alright. One minute. Here goes… uh… dog! Cat! Lion… tiger… bear… horse… cow… pig… chicken… hmm… what else? Sheep… goat… donkey… oh… and a… a… I can’t think of any more. Is the minute up yet?
DOCTOR: Yes, the minute is up. Thank you, Mr. Kammer. That was a good effort. Now, one final question. Can you tell me why you are here today, in your own words?
PATIENT: Why am I here? You’re asking me? After all those questions about apples and animals? Look, I told you. My daughter said I should come. She worries too much. I just… needed a card. A "Get Well" card. Or an encouragement card. From a doctor. That's all. A simple card. Is that so much to ask? It would mean something. It really would.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, thank you for your patience. Based on the assessment, you have some difficulty with immediate recall and word finding. This can be caused by a number of factors, including stress, medication side effects, and underlying medical conditions. While it's not necessarily cause for alarm, I do recommend some further investigation to rule out any potential issues. I suggest a comprehensive blood workup to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and kidney function. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more detailed cognitive evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Neurologist? Now you’re just trying to scare me. I just wanted a card! A simple card! I don't need blood work, and I certainly don't need to see a neurologist. I operate boilers, Doctor! I'm perfectly fine. I just… feel a little low sometimes. It’s the garden, I think. And my wife… But it doesn't mean I’m broken! Look, forget the blood work. Forget the neurologist. Just… give me the card. Please. I've answered all your questions. I’ve been patient. Just… give me the card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your reluctance. While I strongly recommend the further testing, I respect your decision. Here is the card. I want you to know that my concern for your well-being is genuine. I also want to be clear: if you experience any significant changes in your memory, mood, or daily function, please do not hesitate to contact me or seek immediate medical attention. It is always better to err on the side of caution. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: “Wishing you good health and happiness…” It’s… nice, I suppose. But it doesn't say anything about staying strong. Or getting better. No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. Tell your daughter I said hello. She worries too much. And thank you for… trying. I’m going home now. To the garden.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Kammer. Please take care of yourself. And feel free to reach out if you change your mind about the testing.
