DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Soodeen, nice to meet you too. Well, it's just a check-up, really. Routine immunizations, you know? Gotta keep everything up to date. My husband reminded me it was time. He’s good at that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fornes. Preventative care is very important. I see here you haven’t been in for a while – about five years, according to our records. We’ll want to do a full check-up to ensure everything is current, and discuss any changes since your last visit. To start, can you tell me about any current symptoms or health concerns you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Five years, huh? Time flies! Honestly, not much has changed. A little creakier, maybe, if you count that! No real symptoms, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I suppose. Nothing that keeps me up at night or anything. I’ve been pretty lucky with my health, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Fornes. “A little creakier” is perfectly normal, of course. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm, past medical history… let me think. I had chickenpox as a kid, the usual childhood stuff. I broke my arm once falling out of a tree – that was a long time ago! And… I had a pretty bad flu a few years back, but that’s about it, really. Nothing major, no serious illnesses or surgeries. I've always been pretty healthy. I try to eat well and stay active, you know? Do you want to know about my family history, too? My mother had high blood pressure, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Fornes. No surgeries, that's good to know. Chickenpox is typical. And thank you for mentioning your mother's high blood pressure—that is relevant. We’ll definitely want to keep that in mind. Before we move on, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. I really try to avoid medication if I can. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever possible. I do take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. Nothing regular. I'm a big believer in fresh air and good food, that way.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Fornes. I respect your approach to health. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Nope, thankfully no allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t ever had a reaction to a medication. I’m pretty lucky that way, too. Though, I don't really like shellfish, but that’s not an allergy, just a preference!
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Fornes. No allergies is certainly convenient. Alright, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go right ahead, Dr. Soodeen. I don't mind at all. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I'm pretty straightforward, so don't hesitate to ask if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be from talking. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 135 over 85. A little on the higher side, but not drastically so. We’ll monitor that. Now, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat… open wide, please. Ears and nose look clear. Throat is… a little dry. Any recent sore throat or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Hmm, a little dry, you say? Not really. Just been hot lately, I think. Lots of dust kicking around with the construction going on downtown, too. It might just be that. I do drink plenty of water, but maybe not enough with the heat. I tend to forget sometimes. No pain or anything, though. Just dry.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Fornes. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back and relax. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Everything appears within normal limits, Ms. Fornes. However, given your mother’s history of high blood pressure, and your slightly elevated reading today, I'd like to order a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. This will give us a clearer picture of your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Soodeen. If it helps get a clearer picture, I’m happy to do it. My mother would want me to, that's for sure. She was always a big believer in knowing what was going on inside. So, yes, go ahead with the panels. How do we do that? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Fornes. You are right to be proactive. Yes, for the lipid panel, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. Nothing after midnight tonight. The basic metabolic panel doesn't require fasting, but it's best to do both at the same time for convenience. I’ll give you a lab requisition slip. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. They’re open until 5 PM today. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. No problem at all about the fasting. I can definitely manage that. Third door on the left, you say? I’ll head over there after this. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Soodeen. I appreciate it. And thank you for being so thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. And you are right to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I feel much better knowing we’re checking things out. Honestly, just getting a check-up and talking to someone is reassuring. I’ll go get the blood work done now. Thank you again, Dr. Soodeen. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You too, Ms. Fornes. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
