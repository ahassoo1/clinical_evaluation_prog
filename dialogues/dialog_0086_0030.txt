DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It just doesn’t smell like me anymore, if that makes sense. It's been going on for maybe a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… right. And you say it’s been a couple of weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks, give or take a few days. It's not bad, exactly, just… different. Like, I haven't changed anything – same soap, same deodorant, same clothes, same everything. It just… shifted. It's a bit musty, I think? Not like sweat, more like…old things. Does that even make sense? I feel silly trying to describe it.
DOCTOR: It makes some sense, Ms. Purtee. It’s good you’re noticing these things. Sometimes these changes can be benign, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed this change all over, or is it more localized?
PATIENT: It seems to be… everywhere, I think. Under my arms, definitely, but also just… generally. Like when I exercise, it’s more noticeable, but even when I just wake up in the morning, I can smell it. It’s faint, but it's there. I haven’t asked anyone else if they notice, I was too embarrassed!
DOCTOR: Right. And you haven’t experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my weight… hmm. Actually, now that you mention it, I think I have lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? But I figured that was just from the summer heat and not eating as much. It’s been so hot, I haven’t had much of an appetite. I hadn’t really connected it to anything else.
DOCTOR: Five to ten pounds unintentionally?
PATIENT: Yes, unintentionally. I haven’t been trying to lose weight. I just… haven’t been as hungry. And when I do eat, it’s usually smaller portions. It’s been gradual, not like a sudden drop. I didn’t think it was anything to worry about, honestly. I just figured it was the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to being older, you know? And the heat, of course. My knees ache a little, but that’s just getting old too. Nothing new, nothing dramatic. Oh! Wait. My sense of smell might be a little off. Like, I don't smell things as strongly as I used to, but I didn’t know if that was just…age.
DOCTOR: A diminished sense of smell… and the change in body odor, unintentional weight loss, fatigue… We’re going to need to do a little bit of investigating. I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Diabetes… no, never. I’ve had high blood pressure for a few years, and I used to have a bad back, but that’s mostly under control now with medication. My mom had arthritis, but that’s it, as far as I know. No other major illnesses in the family. Is diabetes a possibility with what I’m describing? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It is a possibility, Ms. Purtee, and it’s important to rule it out. The symptoms you’re describing can be associated with diabetes, although they can also be caused by other things. Let's talk about your current medications. Could you tell me what you're taking?
PATIENT: Sure. I take Lisinopril for my blood pressure, 20 milligrams every day. And I used to take a muscle relaxant for my back, but I stopped taking that about six months ago. Oh, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but only when I really need it. That’s it, I think. Just the Lisinopril regularly. And the ibuprofen when needed. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, just the prescription stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’ve taken antibiotics, pain relievers, everything really. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing. I’ve always been pretty good with medications, thankfully. I worry about having allergies, so I’m always careful.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, Ms. Purtee, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. It's just a routine check, but it'll give me a better idea of what's going on. Can you step up on the scale for me first, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I was hoping it wasn’t going to be anything serious. This heat just makes everything feel worse, you know? I’m already uncomfortable with the heat, and now this… It’s a relief to finally be talking to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 130 pounds. That’s a decrease from your last recorded weight. Alright, let's move forward with the exam. If you could just loosen your shirt, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I'm a little chilly now, with the air conditioning and all. It was so hot just walking here! I hope everything is alright, Doctor. My knees have been especially bad lately, maybe that’s something you can check too? They ache all the time.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this point. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. There's some crepitus in both knees, which is common with age and osteoarthritis. Do you experience any swelling or redness with your knees?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. Just the aching, and the clicking sound when I bend them. It’s worse in the mornings, and after I’ve been sitting for a long time. Sometimes it feels like they’re going to lock up on me. It’s just… uncomfortable. More annoying than painful, most of the time. But lately, it's been a little more persistent. Is the enlarged lymph nodes something to worry about? I’m getting a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: The enlarged lymph nodes could be a sign of infection or inflammation, but they're not dramatically enlarged, so I don’t want you to panic. We need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. That will give us a better picture of what's going on. We'll also check your HbA1c, which will tell us your average blood sugar level over the past three months. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. The blood sugar test… that’s for diabetes, right? I haven't had any symptoms of diabetes, have I? I mean, other than the weight loss and tiredness, which could be anything. This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Yes, the HbA1c test will help us rule out diabetes. And you’re right, those symptoms can be caused by many things. It's important not to jump to conclusions. We're just gathering information. I’m also going to order a urinalysis to check for infection. The lab results should be back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will someone call me, or do I have to call the office? I’m not very good with computers, so making appointments online is difficult for me. I prefer talking to a real person. It's just… it's a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: The results usually take about three to five business days. We will call you with the results, Ms. Purtee. Absolutely no need to worry about online appointments. Our staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. We’ll discuss everything in detail then. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—fever, chills, severe fatigue, significant weight loss—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any allergies to latex, by the way?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex. That’s good to know. It’s just…I get so worried about things. My mom always said I was a hypochondriac. But it’s better to be safe than sorry, right? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything. It makes me feel a little better, knowing we’re trying to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Purtee. It is always best to be proactive about your health. And you're welcome. That's what I'm here for. Our nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure. Do you have any difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No, no trouble with walking or balance. I get a little tired, but that’s about it. I think that’s everything. I should probably get going before the traffic gets too bad. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your kindness. I’ll wait for your call. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. You have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
