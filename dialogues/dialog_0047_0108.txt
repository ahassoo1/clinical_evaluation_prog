DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, but...well, things came up. It's my stomach. Been bleedin', you see. Not a pretty sight, let me tell you. Just… not good.
DOCTOR: Bleeding, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, bleedin'. From...down there. Look, I don’t need a lecture on anatomy, alright? It’s enough to say it’s coming out of the wrong end. And it ain't a little bit, either. It's... concerning. Not that you probably understand, sittin' here all healthy and... Scottish.
DOCTOR: Right. Concerning. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Oh, I dunno. A couple of weeks, maybe? Hard to say, really. I mostly just ignore things until they get bad. It started small, you know? Just a little… discoloration. Now it's… more substantial. And it’s tiring, frankly. Losing blood like that can't be good for a man. Especially not one my age.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks… and has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly comes, if I'm bein' honest. Worse after…well, after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Used to be able to eat anything, now… It’s a nuisance. And it smells awful, if you're wonderin'. Like… old pennies, or somethin'. Not somethin' you wanna linger over.
DOCTOR: And you said this is interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Interfering? That's a polite way to put it. Look, I run a crematory. You think you can handle burnt bones and paperwork when you're feelin' weak and… empty? It’s not exactly a glamorous job, but it needs doin'. And it takes a certain… constitution. Which, frankly, I'm startin’ to doubt I still have. It's hard work, you wouldn't believe. And now this bleedin’… it makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: Right. A crematory. And are you experiencing any other symptoms, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit tired, like I said. And… I guess I haven't been as hungry as usual. Not that that’s a bad thing, considering. But yeah, tired, and…weak. And sometimes, my stomach just… hurts. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes with the bleedin', I think. Honestly, it’s all just a mess. And to be clear, I haven’t been tryin’ fancy diets or anything. Just… normal food. Or what used to be normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start there. And then I'll need to do a rectal exam. It's standard procedure, given your symptoms. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A… a what exam? Look, I appreciate you wantin’ to poke around, but I didn't sign up for this. I told you I was bleedin’, not lookin’ for a full-body inspection. And frankly, the thought of someone… down there… No. Absolutely not. I’ll manage. I always have. Just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’, and I'll be on my way. I haven’t got time for this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your discomfort. However, a proper examination is crucial to determine the cause of the bleeding. Simply stopping the bleeding without knowing the source could be dangerous. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something far more serious. We need to rule out possibilities. Without a thorough examination, I cannot provide appropriate medical care. And frankly, your reluctance is concerning. Are you experiencing pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Concerning? I’m the one who's concerning? I'm sittin’ here bleedin’ internally, and you’re talkin' about my reluctance? Look, I’ve lived a long life, alright? Seen things, done things. I know my body. And right now, it’s just…old. Worn out. It happens. You doctors always want to poke and prod and run tests. Never just accept things for what they are. And pain? A little discomfort, maybe. But I've got a high pain tolerance. I deal with… unpleasant things all day. A little stomach ache isn't going to scare me. Are you questioning my assessment of my own body?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, your “assessment” is insufficient. Dismissing potential serious issues based on your own self-diagnosis is irresponsible and potentially life-threatening. I am not questioning your experience, but I am questioning your judgment in this instance. Internal bleeding is never “just” something. It requires investigation. And without a proper examination, I cannot, in good conscience, prescribe any treatment. Frankly, I am beginning to suspect you are not interested in receiving medical care, but simply seeking reassurance. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Reassurance?! Are you insulting me?! Look, I came here because I was starting to get worried, alright? But you...you're makin' things worse! You're accusin' me of lyin', questionin' my judgment, and now you're sayin' I'm lookin' for reassurance?! I've dealt with worse than you, let me tell you. I run a crematory! I've seen the end of life, alright? I know when somethin's wrong. And right now, somethin's wrong. But I don’t need a lecture from a… a Scottish doctor. Forget it. I’m done. I'll deal with it myself. You know what? Don't worry about it. It’ll probably just…stop eventually. Like everything else. .
