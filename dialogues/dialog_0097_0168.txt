DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… a bit delicate, actually. I’m seeing someone, a new gentleman, and I thought it prudent to ensure everything down there is… as it should be. One must be careful, you understand. It’s not every day one finds a suitable companion.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. That's very wise of you. Taking care of your health, and being proactive about it, is always a good thing, and especially when starting a new relationship. We’ll get everything checked out and make sure you have peace of mind. So, to start, have you noticed anything unusual – any changes in discharge, any itching, burning, sores, or pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. No, nothing dramatic. Though, truthfully, at my age, things aren’t quite as… vibrant as they once were. There might be a little dryness, but honestly, that could just be the change of seasons. And frankly, I use a lovely scented soap, so it’s hard to tell if that’s the culprit. It’s a very nice lavender, you see. But sores? No. Pain? Not really. Just… a general lack of… enthusiasm, perhaps. Is that something you test for?
DOCTOR: “Enthusiasm” isn’t a standard medical term, but I understand what you mean! Changes in sensitivity or arousal are definitely something we can discuss, and there are things we can explore if that’s bothering you. We’ll cover all of this. To get a clearer picture, have you experienced any changes in your menstrual cycle recently – any irregularities in bleeding, or has it changed in any way?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. Well, that's a bit of a loaded question, isn't it? At my age, "regular" is a rather optimistic term, Doctor. It's... infrequent, shall we say. And when it does arrive, it's... unpredictable. I honestly haven’t kept meticulous track. It’s not as if I'm planning a family, you understand. My child is quite grown, a lovely young man, quite successful. No, I haven’t noticed anything newly irregular, just the usual… state of affairs. Is this all terribly concerning?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily concerning, Esthela. It's very common for menstrual cycles to become irregular as we approach menopause. We just want to rule out any other possible causes. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see... High blood pressure, yes, a few years back. I take a little pill for that, religiously. And… honestly, I’ve been happily married for quite some time. My late husband and I were… very devoted. We didn’t… well, you can imagine. No STIs, certainly. It’s a rather… indelicate question, Doctor, but I assure you, my current situation is… new. And cautious. I’m a woman of a certain age, and one must be prudent. And I have Medicare, so I’m regularly screened for various things. Do you have access to my records?
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, I do. Let me just pull up your Medicare records here. Okay, I see your diagnosis of hypertension and that you're on medication for it. That's good. And I see some routine screenings, but not a lot of detail regarding specific gynecological history. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’m quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies to penicillin, codeine, nothing. My late husband was terribly allergic to bee stings, poor man, had to carry an EpiPen everywhere. But me? No, perfectly healthy in that respect. Aside from the… seasonal dryness, of course. And the occasional ache. But who doesn’t have aches at my age? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to ensure everything is… functioning correctly. For my gentleman’s sake, naturally. It’s important to be a… complete woman.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Esthela. It’s good you don't have any known allergies. And wanting to ensure everything is functioning well is a perfectly valid reason to come in, for your sake and your companion's. To get a better picture, and with your permission, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. That will involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then a pelvic exam. We'll look at your external genitalia and do an internal exam to check your uterus, ovaries, and cervix. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Well… a pelvic exam… Honestly, Doctor, it’s been quite some time. And truthfully, the thought isn't terribly appealing. But… if it’s necessary… I suppose. I trust your professional judgment. Just… be gentle, please. And explain everything as you go. I’m not as… nimble as I once was, and frankly, I’d prefer not to be startled. And I’d rather not have a student poking around, if you don’t mind. Is that unreasonable?
DOCTOR: Not at all unreasonable, Esthela. Your comfort is my priority, and I completely understand your concerns. We will definitely take things slowly and gently. I will explain everything step-by-step as we go, and absolutely no students will be involved. I'll start with your vital signs, then we'll move to the pelvic exam when you're ready. You'll undress from the waist down, and I’ll provide a gown and a drape for privacy. We’ll use a lubricant to make things as comfortable as possible. Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns about the exam itself?
PATIENT: Well… will it be… painful? I’ve always been a bit… sensitive in that area. And will I need to empty my bladder beforehand? I do try to stay hydrated, you know. It’s important for one’s complexion. Honestly, the thought is rather daunting. I suppose… I just want it to be over quickly. And… discreetly. Is that too much to ask? I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A woman of my standing… one doesn’t want… unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: No, Esthela, that's not too much to ask at all. Discretion and your comfort are absolutely paramount. The exam shouldn't be painful, but it can sometimes be a little uncomfortable, especially if you're tense. We’ll go as slowly as you need, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Emptying your bladder beforehand will make things more comfortable, yes, so thank you for asking. And please, feel free to express any discomfort at all. We can pause or adjust position as needed. I want you to feel safe and in control throughout the entire process. Would you like a few moments to change, and then we can proceed when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A few moments would be… most appreciated. I do try to maintain a certain… decorum, you understand. I shall endeavor to compose myself. And… perhaps if you could explain the procedure again, just as I’m getting changed? It might… calm my nerves. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been this apprehensive in years. It’s not the physical aspect, you see… it’s the… vulnerability of it all. A woman of my age… one doesn’t simply… expose oneself. It's a bit… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. I completely understand. It's perfectly natural to feel apprehensive, and I want to reassure you that your privacy and dignity are my top priorities. I’m happy to explain the procedure again while you change. So, once you’re on the examination table, I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, you’ll lie on your back with your feet in stirrups, similar to a routine gynecological exam. I’ll use a speculum – a gently curved instrument – to open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. This may cause a slight pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll then gently examine the uterus and ovaries to check for any abnormalities. We’ll also do a visual inspection of the external genitalia. The entire process usually takes just a few minutes. Please, take all the time you need to get comfortable. I'll be just outside the room and will let you know when I'm ready to begin. And remember, you can stop me at any time if you're feeling uncomfortable.
