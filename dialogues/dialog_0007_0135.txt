DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking. A little bit of fluid comes out. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, leaking fluid from the ear… that definitely warrants a look. Three days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe four. It is difficult to remember exactly, but around then. It is not much fluid, but enough to… bother me. It makes my clothes a little wet, you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And is it just any time it leaks, or does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a good question. I think… when I lie down, it leaks more. Also, if I clean my ear… with a cloth, then it will come out. But not always. Sometimes it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse when you're lying down and can be triggered by cleaning. Is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, there is no pain. No hurt at all. Just… wetness. And a little… worry, you understand? I have never had this before. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain is good. Strange is a fair way to put it! Have you noticed any changes in your hearing – like it being muffled, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No ringing. My hearing… I think it is normal. Maybe a little quiet, but I am… an older man, you understand? It is normal to not hear like a young person. But no different than usual. I do not think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, any dizziness, or nausea accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No dizziness, no… feeling sick to my stomach. I have been eating normally. I feel… tired, sometimes, but that is normal for me. I am a teacher, you understand? A lot of work. But not because of the ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, have you ever had any ear infections before, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a boy… in Somalia, I had a bad ear ache. A very bad ache. The doctor… he gave me some drops, and it got better. But that was… many years ago. I have not had any trouble since, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear infection. That's helpful to know. And do you recall if you've had any injuries to your head or ear recently, even minor ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. No bump to the head, no hitting my ear on anything. I am careful. I do not do… rough sports, you understand? Mostly just… walking and reading.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your ear then. I'm going to use an otoscope to get a better view. It won't hurt, just let me know if it's uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I will let you know if there is any discomfort. I trust you. Be gentle, please. My ears are… important for teaching, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some redness and a little bit of fluid behind your eardrum. Your eardrum doesn’t appear to be perforated, which is good. It looks like you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, even though you haven't necessarily been swimming. It's likely causing the leakage.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will it damage my hearing? I must be able to hear my students, you understand?
DOCTOR: It means an infection of the outer ear canal – the part you can see. It’s usually not serious, and most cases clear up quickly with treatment. It shouldn’t cause any permanent hearing damage if we treat it promptly. The fluid and redness are signs of inflammation and infection. It can affect your hearing temporarily, which is why we want to get it taken care of. Do you have any allergies to ear drops, or any sensitivities to certain medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I do not take many medicines. Just… sometimes for my blood pressure, but that is all. I have never had trouble with any drops before. My wife… she used to give me drops for my eyes, and I was fine. But she is… gone now. But no problems with drops.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. I’m going to prescribe you some ear drops – a topical antibiotic and steroid combination. Use them as directed, twice a day for seven days. It’s important to finish the entire course, even if your symptoms improve before then. Also, try to keep your ear dry during this time. Avoid swimming or getting water in your ear.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Twice a day for seven days, even if it feels better. Keep it dry. I can do that. No swimming, no water in the ear. That sounds… manageable. Will this… hurt when I put the drops in? Will it be cold? I do not like cold things in my ear.
DOCTOR: The drops should be at room temperature, so they shouldn’t be cold. You might feel a slight tingling or a brief burning sensation when you first put them in, but it shouldn’t be painful. If it is painful, let me know, and we can explore other options. I'm also going to write you a note for work, excusing you from any loud activities for the next few days, just to give your ear a chance to heal.
PATIENT: That is… very thoughtful, Doctor. A note for work. Thank you. I appreciate that. I will be careful to keep it dry, and I will use the drops as you say. Twice a day, even if it feels better. And I will let you know if it hurts. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should not be doing?
DOCTOR: Just avoid putting anything in your ear – no cotton swabs, no fingers, no anything. That can make the infection worse. Also, if you start to develop a fever, or if the pain gets significantly worse despite using the drops, please contact the office right away. Otherwise, just follow the instructions, and hopefully, you'll be feeling much better in a few days. Do you have any other questions for me today, Gerhard?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… everything. No cotton swabs, no fingers, no anything. Keep it dry, twice a day for seven days. And if I get a fever, or the pain gets worse, I will call. I think I understand. You have been very helpful. Thank you for seeing me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gerhard. Glad I could help. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day.
