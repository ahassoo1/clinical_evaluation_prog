DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk about… preventative stuff. About avoiding HIV, you know? She said there's a way to take a pill and… well, she explained it, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. Something about being safe? I just want to understand if it's right for me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Trefren. That’s a very responsible thing to be thinking about, and I’m happy to discuss that with you. Your friend is likely referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It’s a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. Before we get into the specifics of PrEP, let’s just go over a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here you’re 55 years old. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, good, PrEP, that’s the word she used! Yes, that’s exactly what I wanted to talk about. As for medical stuff… hmm. Not much, really. I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s managed with a small pill each day. Nothing else major, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I get regular checkups, but mostly it’s just… getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, getting older certainly comes with its own set of… considerations. Managed high blood pressure is good; thank you for letting me know. And it’s helpful that you have Medicare and are keeping up with regular checkups. Now, to help me determine if PrEP is a good option for you, could you tell me a little bit more about your risk factors for HIV?
PATIENT: Risk factors… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Well, I’m single, have been for a long time. I… I have occasional partners, but nothing steady. I always use protection, of course. Condoms, every time. But my friend said even with those, it’s not 100% safe, and this pill could give me extra peace of mind. Is that what you mean by risk factors? I mostly worry about… well, just being careful, you know? It's a lot to think about at my age.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to be thinking about this, Ms. Trefren, and it’s good that you are being proactive. And no, you haven’t downplayed anything at all. Having occasional partners, even with consistent condom use, does mean you could benefit from discussing PrEP. Condoms are very effective, but as you said, they aren’t foolproof. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how many partners you’ve had in the last six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Six months… It hasn't been many, honestly. Maybe… three? Possibly four. It really varies. Sometimes months go by without anyone. I mostly just… date a bit, have some company. Nothing serious, and I always insist on protection. It’s just… getting older makes you think about these things more, you know? It's not like when I was younger. I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Trefren. It's very responsible of you to prioritize your health, and it’s perfectly normal to re-evaluate risk factors as we age. Three to four partners in the last six months, with consistent condom use, does suggest that PrEP could be a good option to consider. Before we move forward, I'd like to ask a few more questions to ensure PrEP is safe for you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. I've been lucky that way. I can take most things without any trouble. That’s another reason I figured talking about this wouldn't be a complete disaster! Now, is this pill something I have to take every day? Because honestly, remembering things is… a challenge these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the allergies. And yes, you are right to ask about the medication schedule. Originally, PrEP was taken daily, but now there are options. There’s a daily pill, and there’s also an on-demand regimen – taking two pills before and two pills after sexual activity. We can discuss which option might be best for you based on your lifestyle and how easily you think you’d be able to adhere to the schedule. Before we decide that, I’d like to briefly review your past medical history again, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems… hmm. Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve had regular checkups with my doctor, and they haven't said anything about my kidneys. I did have a bit of a bladder infection years ago, but that was decades ago, and it cleared up quickly with antibiotics. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m a bit worried about side effects. Are there any bad ones with this pill?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the bladder infection. It's important to note even old infections, and that won't likely be a problem. As for side effects, that’s a very valid concern. The most common side effects are mild, like nausea, fatigue, or headache, and they usually go away within a few weeks as your body adjusts to the medication. Rarely, there can be some impact on kidney function, which is why we need to rule out any pre-existing kidney problems. Before we go any further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood work to check your kidney function, and also screen for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it's going to make sure I’m healthy enough for this, then absolutely. Blood work and a checkup. It's probably a good idea. The sooner we know, the better, right? Will the blood work take long? I have an appointment later this afternoon… I don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, the sooner we have the information, the better. The blood work shouldn't take long at all, Ms. Trefren. It's just a standard panel, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We can do the physical exam right here in the room, and then you can head over to the lab for the blood draw. If you're comfortable, let's start with the physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Let’s just get it over with, then. The sooner I know if this is a good idea, the better. My blood pressure is probably a little high just from worrying!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Trefren. It's common for blood pressure to be slightly elevated in a medical setting, especially when discussing something new. Take a deep breath for me, please. And again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so, and as we discussed, likely influenced by being in the office. Everything seems to be functioning normally here. Now, I’ll just feel your lymph nodes… No swelling detected. Everything feels normal. So far, everything looks good. We’ll have a better picture once we get the blood work results back. Now, would you mind heading over to the lab to get that drawn?
PATIENT: No, that’s fine. Everything feels normal is good! Yes, let's get the blood work done. Hopefully, it doesn’t take too long. I just want to get this sorted out. Where is the lab? I hope they aren't too busy.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will need your insurance card and identification. They’re usually pretty efficient, and it shouldn’t take long. Here’s the requisition form for the lab technician. It lists the tests I’ve ordered. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can head back here, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you have any questions or feel unwell, please don’t hesitate to let the nursing staff know. Is there anything I can assist you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and… patient with me. I really appreciate it. Hopefully, the results will be back soon. I’ll head to the lab now. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Trefren. It was my pleasure. I understand it can be a lot to take in, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
