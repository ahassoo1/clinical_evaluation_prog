DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I think… I’m here about getting surgery? For my weight. My wife helped me set it up, honestly. I don’t really remember all the details, but something about… making it easier to lose weight?
DOCTOR: Surgery for weight loss… I see. And you’re unsure of the specifics?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty unsure. It was a lot of talking, you know? And I… I don’t always remember things so well. My wife did most of the research, I think. She said something about a… evaluation? To see if I’m a good candidate? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. We do require a thorough evaluation to determine if bariatric surgery is a suitable option for each patient. It's not a decision we take lightly. Let's start with some background information, then. Could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Um… I don’t really… have much of one, I guess? I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time. Nothing major, ever. No big illnesses or anything. I think I had the flu once, maybe twice. I’m not sure. Does that make sense? I just… avoid going if I can. It’s usually just a cold, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. While you report a limited medical history, it's still important to be comprehensive. Have you ever been diagnosed with conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… diabetes… cholesterol… No, I don't think so. No one ever told me I had those. My wife sometimes talks about checking my blood sugar, but I don't remember a doctor saying anything about any of that. Is that…bad? Should they have?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon for people to be unaware of these conditions, especially if they haven’t had regular check-ups. However, these are important factors when considering bariatric surgery. Let’s move on to past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Nope. Nothing. Never had anything taken out or put in. Not even… tonsils or anything like that. I was lucky, I guess. No broken bones, either. Just… bumps and bruises like everyone else. I’m pretty careful. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… tough. My dad, he passed away a few years ago. Heart problems, I think. And my mom, she’s… well, she’s not doing so great, either. She has some issues with her joints, mostly. Lots of pain. And… I don’t really know much beyond that. We didn’t talk about it much. It wasn't something we did. Does that help? It feels… vague.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have some information, even if it is limited. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never have. Never will. My wife… she doesn’t like it. And I don’t really see the point, honestly. It smells bad, and I like to be able to breathe. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I drink… sometimes. Mostly on holidays, or if we’re out with friends. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing crazy. My wife and I, we don’t really go out much. Not a big drinker. Never have been. It doesn't really appeal to me. Does that sound alright?
DOCTOR: Acceptable. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… Not that I know of. I mean, I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes with pollen, but that's all. I'm pretty lucky, I think. My wife always asks, but I always tell her the same thing. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. I'll need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure, sounds good. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I don't really like doctors poking around, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't be unduly uncomfortable, Mr. Kochubey. It's a standard examination. I’ll be as gentle as possible. If you could lie on your back, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. It’s simply a matter of routine.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just let me know if it's going to hurt, alright? I get a little… worried sometimes. And maybe tell me what you’re doing? It helps me relax a bit.
DOCTOR: I will inform you of each step. Now, I am inflating the cuff. This will create pressure on your arm for a brief period. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Pulse is 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly distant. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there is some… tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Can you describe any pain you experience when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that… yeah, that’s a little sore. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. It feels… kind of dull, you know? Like a pressure. It’s been there for a while, actually. I thought it was just… indigestion, maybe? I eat a lot of… well, my wife says I eat a lot of everything. Does that make sense? It doesn’t really bother me all the time. Just sometimes, when she pushes like that.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the right upper quadrant could indicate several things. It’s likely nothing serious, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I’d like to order some routine blood work and an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an ultrasound? I… I don’t really like needles. And those machines… they look scary. But… if you think it’s important, I guess so. My wife will probably want me to get it done anyway. She's very careful about this sort of thing. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: The blood work is a simple procedure, Mr. Kochubey. A small sample will be taken from your arm. The discomfort is minimal, a brief sting. The ultrasound is non-invasive; a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and use a handheld device to create images. It shouldn't be painful. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound appointment can be scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. I will have my staff provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. I mean, I’m still a little worried about the needles, but… if it helps, I guess I’ll do it. Just… please tell the person doing it to be gentle? And… explain what they’re doing? Thank you, Doctor. I think I’m ready to go now. Hopefully everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will escort you to the lab and schedule your ultrasound. I will review the results when they are available and contact you to discuss the next steps. Please do not hesitate to call if you experience any sudden or worsening symptoms.
