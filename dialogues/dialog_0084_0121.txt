DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I'm Dr. Voytek. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… a couple months, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… blends together, you know? It's just been getting worse lately, that’s for sure. Makes things blurry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A couple of months, and worsening recently. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both of 'em, Doctor. Not terrible all the time, but… when I'm workin' outside, or when it's windy… real bad. Makes it hard to see straight. I'm a cement mason, so I need to see good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with outdoor work and wind exposure. That’s helpful to know. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Like… what kinda symptoms? They just feel dry, like sand in 'em. Sometimes a little itchy, I guess. No pain, thankfully. Just… uncomfortable. I don't know all the fancy words for things.
DOCTOR: No, no fancy words needed at all. Just tell me what you feel. Okay, so dryness and some mild itching, no pain. Have you noticed any redness or discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: Redness… sometimes. Hard to tell, maybe. I don’t look at ‘em that close, usually. No… nothing comin’ out of ‘em, no. Just dry. I wipe ‘em a lot, maybe that’s why I don't see nothin’ comin’ out. It's probably just dust from the cement.
DOCTOR: Okay, so redness occasionally, no discharge. You wipe them frequently due to the dryness. Let's take a look. Could you sit up and look straight ahead for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Hope this don't take too long. Got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take a quick look. Hmm…okay. There’s some mild injection – that’s redness in the whites of your eyes – and your cornea looks a little dry, but nothing too concerning at first glance. I’m also going to check your tear production. I'll gently pull down your lower eyelid and see how much moisture is there.
PATIENT: Moisture? I thought you just looked at that. What's the difference? Is this gonna poke me? I don’t like things pokin’ my eyes.
DOCTOR: No poking, I promise. Looking at your eyes tells me if they look dry, but this test tells me how well they're making tears. It's a quick check. I’m using a small strip of paper – it won't touch your eye, just go near it. It measures how much fluid is there when you blink. Okay?
PATIENT: Okay… if it don’t poke. Just get it over with, alright? I got cement waitin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I’m going to leave these in for a moment. Don't blink too much, but don't strain to not blink either. Just natural blinks. It'll only take about five seconds. Okay… Hmm. Your tear production is a little low, which confirms what we suspected. It looks like you have mild dry eye. Considering your work, that's not too surprising. Do you use any eye protection when working with cement?
PATIENT: Eye protection? Like… goggles? Sometimes. Not always. Gets in the way. And they fog up. Hard to see with foggy goggles, ya know? Safer to just… blink a lot. I thought the wind just dried 'em out, that's all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Goggles can be a hassle, and fogging is a problem. But the cement dust is likely a big contributor, even without the wind. Frequent blinking helps, but it’s not enough in your situation. We need to try to protect your eyes better and add some lubrication. Have you ever tried using artificial tears?
PATIENT: Artificial… what now? Like, fake tears? Never. Sounds… silly. Don't need fake tears. Just need my real ones to work better. Are these expensive? I don't have a lot of extra money. Just payin' the bills.
DOCTOR: No, they’re not expensive at all. They’re like drops, and they help keep your eyes moist. They're over the counter, so no prescription needed. Think of them like lotion for your eyes. They won't fix the problem completely, but they can provide a lot of relief. We can start with a basic preservative-free artificial tear. Those are generally better if you need to use them frequently. Would you be willing to try those?
PATIENT: Okay… if they don't cost much. And if they easy to use. I don't need nothin' complicated. I gotta get back to work soon, ya know? Cement ain't gonna pour itself. Where can I get these… drops?
DOCTOR: They’re very easy to use. You just tilt your head back and gently pull down your lower eyelid, then put one or two drops in each eye. Most pharmacies – like Walgreens or CVS – will have them. They're usually in the eye care section. They’re relatively inexpensive, usually under $10 a bottle. I'll write down the name of one that I recommend. I also want you to try wearing some sort of eye protection, even if it’s just safety glasses, whenever possible. Here you go. This is Systane Ultra. It’s a good starting point. Try using them four times a day, or as needed. If you don't see improvement after a week or two, let me know, and we can discuss other options. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Systane… alright. Four times a day. I can remember that. Safety glasses… I'll try. Don't promise nothin'. Uh… no, I think that's it. Just wanna get this figured out and get back to work. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Just remember, if your eyes get worse, or if you experience any pain, see me right away. Here's a handout with some more information about dry eye. Take care, Mr. Pipolo. And please, try to protect your eyes!
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks again, Doctor.
