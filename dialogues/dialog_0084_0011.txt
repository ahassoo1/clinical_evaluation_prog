DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, uh, good mornin’ to you too. Look, I ain’t got all day. Just need a paper signed. Somethin’ about… gettin’ somethin’ done. The place said I needed clearance from a doctor. That’s all. Just need to be quick, please. Don't recall exactly what they need cleared, to be honest. Been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, to sign off on anything, I do need some information. It's important I understand what you need cleared and why. Do you remember where you need this clearance for?
PATIENT: A place… downtown, I think. A beauty place. They got, you know, machines. For… fixin’ things. On your face. That’s all I remember. It was recommended by a friend. Seemed alright at the time. Don’t ask me for a name, though. Old man's memory, you understand. Just want the paper signed, really. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, it's not hard, Mr. Honcoop. But those “machines” you mentioned… they can be medical procedures. Even if it's cosmetic, I need to know what they're doing to your face to make sure it’s safe for you, given your health. Do you have any idea what kind of treatment they were offering?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture on safety. I’m a grown man. It was… tightenin’ somethin’. My face, yeah. Saggin’ a little, you see? They said they could fix it with… electricity, maybe? And lasers. I don’t know! They used a lot of fancy words. It ain’t like I’m gettin’ brain surgery, it's just… a little touch-up. And frankly, I find this whole process very… condescending.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, even a “little touch-up” involving electricity and lasers can carry risks. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might make it unsafe. Plus, I need to document what procedure they’re proposing. Do you remember the name of the place, or even the name of the person who recommended it?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I told you, my memory ain’t what it used to be! It was a fella… name started with a ‘D’, maybe? And the place… bright lights, lots of posters. Look, I’m a practical man. I fix things for a livin’. Radio towers, cell phones… I don't need a long consultation over a little face lift! Just sign the paper, so I can get on with my day. It's probably just a formality anyway. What's the worst that could happen?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your chart says you’re uninsured, and your weight is listed as 52 kilograms… that’s quite low. Have you experienced any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Hold on now, what's my weight got to do with anything? That’s personal! And, uh, I eat just fine. Always have. Maybe I’m just… a small man. Always been lean. Look, are we talkin’ about the paper or my life story here? This is gettin' ridiculous. I don't appreciate bein’ interrogated. Just sign it! It's a cosmetic thing, I tell ya!
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration. However, I can't ethically sign off on a medical procedure without a basic understanding of your health. That includes your weight, as significant weight loss can indicate an underlying medical problem. This form is a brief health questionnaire – just a few simple questions. It will help me determine if you’re a suitable candidate for this procedure, and if further testing is needed. It’s for your safety, and mine. Will you please fill it out?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a busy man! I ain't got time for questionnaires! This is absurd. I came here for a simple signature, not a medical examination. Honestly, I think I'm wasting my time. I'm not fillin' out anythin'. You know what? Forget it. I'll find another doctor. One who doesn't waste people's time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I cannot sign a medical clearance without gathering some information. Given your low weight and the nature of the procedure you're seeking, I strongly advise you to see a specialist – perhaps an internist – for a full health evaluation before proceeding. It’s for your own well-being. Here’s a list of a few doctors in the area. I wish you the best. .
