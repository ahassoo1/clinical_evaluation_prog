DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Maskal. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the requirement to wear masks and other protective gear. I believe I may need an exemption, or perhaps some alternative solutions, and my employer suggested I come speak with a medical professional.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you're needing documentation regarding your ability to wear a mask for work, or exploring alternatives. To get started, can you tell me a little bit more about the type of work you do, and what specifically makes wearing a mask difficult?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a Protective Service Worker. It’s a varied role, Doctor, but it involves direct contact with individuals in need – assisting families, ensuring safety, that sort of thing. It’s… difficult to explain precisely why it's challenging. It isn't a physical ailment, not in the way one might think. More… a sensitivity. A discomfort, an overwhelming feeling. It impacts my ability to focus and provide the level of care my clients deserve when I am wearing a face covering. I apologize if that sounds vague. I’ve found it hard to articulate.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It's good you're able to describe it, even if it's difficult. It sounds like you're experiencing some level of anxiety or discomfort related to wearing a mask, which is valid. To help me understand better and see what options might be available, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any anxiety or panic disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. No, I haven’t been formally diagnosed with any anxiety or panic disorders. I’ve always been a… private person, and haven’t sought medical attention for emotional or mental health concerns previously. My discomfort feels specifically tied to the mask itself, the feeling of restriction, and the impact on my breathing and ability to communicate clearly. I’ve never had issues like this before the recent requirements at work. Perhaps it is a new development?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It’s certainly possible it’s a new development, triggered by the work requirements. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discomfort – things like a racing heart, sweating, dizziness, or feeling short of breath when wearing the mask?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, there are some accompanying symptoms. My heart does race a bit, and I notice I begin to sweat more readily. Not profusely, but enough to be noticeable. And yes, there's a sensation of… tightness in my chest. It doesn't feel like a physical pain, more like… pressure. It does make it difficult to breathe normally, which, as you might imagine, isn’t ideal for my work. I also find myself becoming easily distracted and overwhelmed when wearing it for extended periods. It affects my focus, my ability to think clearly and respond appropriately to the situations I encounter.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing a physiological response to wearing the mask, and it’s good we're getting a clear picture of what's happening. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu, that might be affecting your breathing or making you more sensitive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have been in good health. I’ve always been careful to avoid illness, and I haven’t been sick in quite some time. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat well, and get regular exercise. The onset of these feelings coincided directly with the implementation of the mask requirements at my workplace. It wasn’t gradual, it began immediately. I can assure you, my physical state is otherwise strong and capable. It is… puzzling.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to quickly review your EHR to see if there's anything relevant in your past medical history that might be contributing to this. Just one moment… Okay, I see you’ve had routine check-ups, vaccinations are up to date, and no significant chronic conditions. No history of asthma or COPD, which is good. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any regular medications. I believe in maintaining a natural lifestyle whenever possible. I do occasionally take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as we don’t get much sunlight here, but that’s the extent of it. Nothing prescribed by a physician, nothing ongoing. I've always been quite healthy, as I mentioned. This is why the situation is so… unexpected. I haven’t needed to rely on medications or supplements previously.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing a strong physiological and emotional response to wearing a mask, and it's not related to any underlying medical condition. It’s possible you have a sensitivity or mild form of claustrophobia triggered by the feeling of restriction. To be thorough, I would like to perform a quick physical exam – just to listen to your lungs and check your heart rate and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I appreciate your attention to detail. I am happy to cooperate in any way that will help us determine the cause of this issue and find a suitable solution. Please proceed as you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Take a few deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay, your lung sounds are clear – no wheezing or crackling. Now I'm going to listen to your heart. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, which is consistent with your reported anxiety, but the rhythm is normal. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, also likely due to anxiety. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything sounds normal, which supports the idea that this is primarily a physiological response.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Knowing there isn’t a physical ailment contributing to this situation does alleviate some of my concerns. It confirms my suspicion that this is a reaction to the mask itself. So, what are our options at this point? Is an exemption a possibility, or are there alternatives we can explore to allow me to continue my work safely and effectively? I understand the importance of safety precautions, and I wouldn’t want to compromise the well-being of my clients or myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Given your normal physical exam and the clear connection to wearing a mask, I believe an exemption may be possible, but it would ultimately be up to your employer and their specific policies. I can certainly write a letter outlining your symptoms, the physical exam findings, and my medical opinion. However, before we go that route, let's explore some alternatives. Have you tried different types of masks?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. A letter from you would be incredibly helpful. And to answer your question, yes, I have tried several different types of masks. The standard surgical masks, the N95 respirators, and even some of the cloth masks. Unfortunately, none of them have alleviated the discomfort. In fact, the N95 respirators tend to exacerbate the feelings of restriction, and the cloth masks don’t offer the same level of security, which increases my anxiety. I’ve tried adjusting the fit, ensuring they are not too tight or too loose, but nothing seems to make a significant difference. It is the act of wearing any mask that triggers the response.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Given that you’ve tried different types of masks without success, and your symptoms are consistent regardless, it further supports the idea that a mask is not a viable solution for you. Before I write the letter, let's discuss some potential accommodations. Would a face shield be an option?
PATIENT: A face shield… that is an interesting thought, Doctor. I hadn’t considered that. I suppose it would offer some level of protection without the complete restriction of a mask. I would be willing to try a face shield, provided it meets the safety standards required by my employer. Would that be sufficient protection in a professional setting, in your medical opinion? I am concerned about adequately safeguarding myself and my clients, of course. I’d need to verify it’s permissible under health and safety regulations, as well.
DOCTOR: A face shield can be an effective alternative, especially in situations where close contact is unavoidable. It provides a physical barrier against respiratory droplets, which is the primary concern. However, it's not quite as effective as a well-fitted mask, as it doesn't fully enclose the mouth and nose. That being said, in your case, given your clear physiological response to masks, and the fact that you've explored other options, I believe a face shield is a reasonable accommodation. I can include a statement in the letter recommending a face shield as an alternative, and emphasizing the importance of combining it with other safety measures, like frequent handwashing and social distancing. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly acceptable. A face shield combined with those additional safety measures sounds like a viable solution. I am grateful for your understanding and willingness to explore alternatives. Knowing that I have a medical professional supporting my request will be incredibly helpful. And yes, please include that statement in the letter. Thank you. I appreciate your thoroughness and guidance. Now, how long will it take to prepare the letter?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad we were able to find a potential solution. I can have the letter prepared and ready for you within the hour. My assistant will print it out and we'll go over it together to ensure everything is accurate. It will include your symptoms, the physical exam findings, my medical opinion, and the recommendation for a face shield as a reasonable accommodation. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and expertise. I truly appreciate your assistance in this matter. One hour is perfectly acceptable. I look forward to reviewing the letter with you. I’m hopeful this will resolve the issue with my employer. Thank you again.
