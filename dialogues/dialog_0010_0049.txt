DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Schneer, that's right. Well, it's my ears, I think. Things just… aren't as clear as they used to be. It's a bit of a bother, really. Not sure exactly when it started, just... gradually, you know?
DOCTOR: Gradually, alright. So, it’s a change in your hearing, not a sudden loss?
PATIENT: Sudden? No, no, not sudden. More like… everything's muffled. Like talking underwater, maybe? Though I haven’t been underwater in… goodness, a long time. I used to work at the shoe factory, you know. Lots of noise there, but this is different. It’s not a ringing, just… quieted. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Schneer. Muffled hearing, not a ringing, just a general quietness. And you mentioned working at the shoe factory - was there a lot of loud machinery, prolonged exposure to noise?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, a lot of noise. Clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. Those machines were somethin’ else. Been retired for… oh, twenty years now, maybe more? A long time, anyway. Used to operate one of them stitchers, big fella it was. Always wore earplugs, I think. Or… maybe not always. It's hard to remember things these days, you know? It was a good job, though. Steady.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common for hearing to be affected by prolonged noise exposure, even with earplugs. We'll certainly factor that into things. Besides the muffling, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really. Everything just sounds… distant. And sometimes, when folks are talkin', I gotta ask 'em to repeat themselves. Especially the young ones, they mumble so! Is that a symptom? Or just… young people talkin’? I don't know. It's harder to hear the television too, I turn it up pretty loud. My neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, says I’m disturbin’ her.
DOCTOR: It sounds like the difficulty hearing, needing to ask for repetitions, and turning up the volume are all things we should investigate, Mr. Schneer. It’s not unusual for hearing to change with age as well, so it could be a combination of factors. Let’s do a quick ear exam, if you don't mind. Then we can talk about next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, yes. An ear exam sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Never been one for complainin’, but it is gettin’ a bit tiresome, havin' to ask folks to shout. Just… go ahead whenever you're ready. It doesn't hurt, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t hurt at all, Mr. Schneer. I’m just going to look inside your ears with this little light. I’ll need you to sit still, and if I see anything that needs a closer look, I’ll let you know. Alright, let’s start with this ear. Can you tell me if that’s comfortable?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, that’s alright. A little strange, feelin’ somethin’ in there, but not painful. Just… odd. Like a little tickle, maybe. I can still hear you talkin’, which is good. Used to get earaches when I was a little boy, though. Dreadful things. But this isn't like that at all. Is there somethin' wrong? You don't have to tell me if it's bad, I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t like an earache at all, Mr. Schneer, and I’m not seeing any signs of infection. I do notice some wax buildup in both ears, and the ear canal seems a little narrow. It’s possible the wax is contributing to the muffled hearing. I’d like to perform a simple hearing test to get a better idea of how well you're hearing different frequencies. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Oh, alright. Never had one of those before. Sounds… thorough. Is it a loud test? My neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, she’s got sensitive ears, you know. I wouldn’t want to disturb her. Are we in a soundproof room? If it's too loud, I can just… stop, alright? I’m an old man, I don’t need all that fancy equipment.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. We can absolutely stop at any time. And yes, we are in a relatively soundproof room, and the test isn't painful at all—just a series of tones and words played at different volumes. We’ll start quietly and gradually increase the volume. I’ll be right here with you the whole time, and we can adjust it to your comfort level. If you’re comfortable, let's put these on, and we can give it a try. It will take about ten to fifteen minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ten to fifteen minutes… alright. Sounds reasonable. Headphones… haven't worn those in a long time. Used to listen to the radio, back in the day. Mostly polkas. My wife, bless her soul, she loved polkas. Go ahead, Doctor. Let's see what you find. I trust you. Just… be gentle with the volume, alright? Don't want to frighten Mrs. Higgins.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, I’m going to play some tones in your ears. Whenever you hear a tone, please press this button. It’s okay if you don’t hear anything; just stay relaxed. We'll start with the right ear… Here we go. And now, let's try the left ear…
PATIENT: Hmm… that one. I think I heard somethin’. Faint. Like a… whisper. No… nothin’. Wait… Is that right? Am I supposed to press it for every little sound? It’s hard to tell, Doctor. Everything’s so… muffled, you know? This left ear… not hearin’ much at all, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. You're doing great. It sounds like you're having more difficulty hearing in your left ear, which is consistent with what we’ve discussed. The results of the initial test confirm some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies in both ears, and a more significant loss in the left. Based on these findings, it appears you have sensorineural hearing loss, which is common with age and noise exposure. We can discuss options to help improve your hearing. Would you like to hear about those now?
PATIENT: Sensorineural… that’s a mouthful. And “common with age,” eh? Well, I suppose that’s just the way of things. Improving my hearing… yes, that would be nice. Not having to ask folks to repeat themselves all the time. My wife… she used to get frustrated when I didn’t hear her. Yes, Doctor, tell me what my options are. Whatever will help me hear a bit better. Just… no loud noises, alright? And nothing too complicated. I'm an old man, remember?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. No loud noises or complicated procedures, I promise. The most common solution for sensorineural hearing loss is a hearing aid. They come in different styles, sizes, and levels of sophistication. They work by amplifying sounds, making them easier to hear. There are behind-the-ear models, in-the-ear models, and completely-in-canal models. The best choice for you would depend on the severity of your hearing loss, your lifestyle, and your personal preferences. We can also discuss assistive listening devices, like amplified telephones or TV listening systems. Would you like to learn more about hearing aids first?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I’ve seen folks wear ‘em. Always thought they looked a bit… obvious. But if it will help… yes, tell me about ‘em. Which one would be best for an old man like me? Something simple. I don't need all the bells and whistles, just something to make the sounds a bit louder. And are they expensive? My retirement check doesn't stretch too far, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very common concern, Mr. Schneer. Many modern hearing aids are quite discreet, and we can certainly find one that fits comfortably and blends in well. Given your preference for simplicity, I would recommend a behind-the-ear or receiver-in-canal model. They're relatively easy to use and maintain, and they often offer good sound quality. As for cost, hearing aids can be an investment, typically ranging from $1,500 to $4,000 per aid, depending on the features and technology. However, most insurance plans, including Medicare, do offer some coverage, and we have financing options available. I recommend a hearing test with a licensed audiologist. They can provide a comprehensive evaluation of your hearing and recommend the best hearing aid based on your specific needs and budget. Would you like me to give you a referral to a trusted audiologist in the area?
PATIENT: A referral… yes, that would be very helpful, Doctor. I don’t want to go to just anyone. Someone you trust. And $1,500 to $4,000… goodness gracious! That’s a lot of money. I’ll have to talk to my neighbor, Mrs. Higgins. She’s good with finances. Yes, please, a referral. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. It's still a bit much to take in, but at least I have a starting point. Now, about Mrs. Higgins… do you think it would be alright if I just… mentioned the hearing test to her? She always has an opinion on everything.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schneer. You can absolutely mention the hearing test to Mrs. Higgins. It’s always good to have a second opinion, and she sounds like a helpful neighbor. Here's the contact information for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-respected audiologist just a few miles from here. She’s very patient and understanding, and she’ll work with you to find the best solution for your hearing needs. She also accepts Medicare. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. The referral is perfect. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. It’s nice to have someone listen, you know? Really listen. I should probably get goin’ now. Mrs. Higgins is expectin’ me for tea. And I don’t want to keep her waitin’. She makes a lovely scone. Thank you, Doctor Annesley. You’ve been a great help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoy your tea and scones with Mrs. Higgins! And please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good afternoon!
