DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so just... the blood pressure thing. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband is concerned about your blood pressure, and that’s why you’re here today. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely take a look at that. Just to clarify, has a blood pressure reading been formally taken recently, or is this based on how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Honestly? Feeling. He got one of those things for home use, a little while back, and he kept poking at me with it. Said it was high a couple of times, but I felt fine. He just... kept on about it. I don’t see what the big deal is.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like he’s just being cautious, and that’s understandable. Sometimes those home readings can be a little off, or people can get anxious when they know it’s being checked, which can raise it temporarily. To get a good baseline, I’d like to take your blood pressure myself, and also ask you a few questions about your health history. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Not at all. It won't take long, I promise. Let's start with some basic questions, and then I'll do a quick physical check. First, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Look, I work. I’m a civil engineering tech. Out in the field a lot. It's physical work, mostly. I eat when I can, mostly just stuff my husband makes. I don't have time for fancy health stuff. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Knowing you have a physically demanding job is important. And it sounds like your husband does a lot of the cooking, which is good to know as well. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Never been sick enough for any of that fancy stuff. I had the flu once, a long time ago, but that's it. I'm strong. I don't get sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior diagnoses is good information. And it’s great you generally stay healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, never anything serious. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. They put a cast on it, and that was the end of that. Definitely don't go to the hospital unless I absolutely have to. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations beyond the broken wrist as a child – that's helpful. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, grandparents, siblings – has anyone in your family had high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history. Okay, my dad... he had something wrong with his heart, I think. He was always tired. He died when I was young. My mom is fine, as far as I know. She’s...older. Doesn't talk about health stuff. And I have a brother, but haven't seen him in years. He probably has something wrong with him, knowing him. He always made bad choices. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me something to work with. Your father had heart problems, and your mother is generally healthy. It's not ideal to have limited information about your family history, but we can still proceed. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything. I've never had a problem. He tries to get me to take vitamins, but I don't bother. I don't need them. I eat enough. It’s all this worrying that's making me feel bad, not some deficiency.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you don’t have any allergies. And I understand your frustration with the vitamins – if you’re eating a balanced diet, they might not be necessary. Finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor gives me when I have a headache. That’s it. And sometimes, when I’m really sore from work, I take ibuprofen. He keeps telling me to take something for my joints, but I ignore him. All this talk is giving me a headache now, actually. Can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for soreness, and headache medication when you have headaches. Nothing regular. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam, then we’ll check your blood pressure. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall health. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry it up. This chair isn’t very comfortable. It’s all just a waste of time, you know. He worries too much. My blood pressure is fine. I can feel it. It's all just stress.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your pulse is strong and regular, at 78 beats per minute. Your breathing is normal. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. It’s a little elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? See! This is why I didn’t want to bother with this. He’s probably stressing me out right now just by making me sit here. That's it. It's his fault. I knew something was wrong the minute he started poking at me with that thing. You can tell him that. It's psychological. All of it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and it’s good to consider stress as a factor. However, a blood pressure reading of 148/92 mmHg is considered Stage 1 hypertension. While stress can certainly contribute to temporary increases, this reading warrants further investigation. Ignoring it or solely attributing it to stress isn't the best course of action. It's important to rule out any underlying medical causes. We can repeat the measurement after a few minutes of rest to confirm, but even if it comes down slightly, we’ll want to discuss some additional steps to determine the cause and ensure your health. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Ugh, options. More poking and prodding, I bet. Look, I work hard. I don't have time for tests and appointments. What kind of tests are you talking about? Blood work? I hate needles. Is that what you’re going to tell me? Just tell me if it’s bad and I’ll tell him to stop worrying. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Dudney, and I assure you I'll try to minimize any inconvenience. Typically, with elevated blood pressure, we’d start with some basic blood work. This would include checking your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. These tests can help us rule out other medical conditions that could be contributing to your high blood pressure. It also helps us assess your overall cardiovascular risk. We might also recommend an EKG, a simple, painless test to check the electrical activity of your heart. And yes, it would involve a small blood sample, so a needle is involved. However, it’s a quick procedure, and we can take steps to make you as comfortable as possible. I want to emphasize that these tests aren’t necessarily to confirm a serious problem, but rather to rule out potential causes and ensure we’re providing you with the best possible care. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: Look, he’ll have a fit if I don’t even try. He’s like that. Fine. Do the tests. But if it’s going to take all day, I’m leaving. And tell him to stay calm. He stresses me out more than anything. Just get it over with. Fast. And no lectures, okay? I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney, I understand. We’ll get it done as quickly as possible, and I promise no lectures. I’ll order the blood work and an EKG for you right now. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will take good care of you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan together. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, it might be helpful to focus on some lifestyle modifications that can help lower blood pressure, such as reducing salt intake, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Would you be interested in discussing some resources that might be helpful with those things?
PATIENT: Resources? Oh, don't bother. He's already got a whole list. Salt-free cookbooks, exercise videos, meditation apps... it's ridiculous. He’s already trying to control everything I do. No. Just the tests. And then tell me what's wrong. That’s it. Don't tell me about salt-free anything. It's just...stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney, I understand. We’ll focus on the tests for now. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood, and then they'll get you set up for the EKG. It should only take about 15-20 minutes total. I'll call you as soon as the results are available, usually within a day or two. In the meantime, if you experience any severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the better. Honestly, I don't know why I even came. He’ll probably blame me if anything's wrong anyway. This whole thing is… a waste of time. Just call me when you have the results.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. I'll let the lab technician know you’re ready. Thank you for coming in today. .
