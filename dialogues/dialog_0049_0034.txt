DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's... well, my husband and I just moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up? He said I needed to get seen, since we're new to the area. I don't really... remember everything. It's kinda fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A general check-up, alright. And you said it's a bit fuzzy remembering things?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. Not all the time, but… important stuff sometimes. Like, dates and… why I’m doing things. My husband mostly keeps track of appointments and stuff. It's not… a big deal, usually. Just frustrating. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Bonck. We can certainly explore that a bit today. Let’s start with a basic review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Not for a long time. We lived… somewhere else before, and I didn’t go often. Just when something was really bad. I think I had the usual kid stuff, like chickenpox, when I was little, but… that was ages ago. Does that help? I don’t even remember who I saw back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, infrequent medical care in the past. No significant medical illnesses that you recall?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mean, nothing major. I get… tired sometimes. And my back hurts if I stand for too long, but I work with machines all day so… I figured that was normal? Is that… something I should be telling you? I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: It's my job to assess these things, Ms. Bonck. Fatigue and back pain are worth discussing. Let’s start with the back pain. Where exactly does it hurt, and how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Good. It's mostly… lower back. Like, right at the small of my back. And it's been… a while. Probably since I started the job, maybe two years? It's not always hurting, but it gets worse at the end of the day. Like, achey and stiff. And sometimes it feels like… pins and needles in my legs, but that doesn’t happen all the time.
DOCTOR: Two years of intermittent lower back pain, worsening at the end of the day, with occasional pins and needles in the legs. Have you tried anything for it – heat, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Yeah, my husband gets me those… sticky heat patches? They help a little, for a few hours. And I've taken… ibuprofen, I think it's called? When it's really bad. It doesn’t really take it away, just makes it… duller. I don’t like taking too much, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll note that the heat patches and ibuprofen provide only minimal relief. Now, let’s talk about this fatigue you mentioned. Can you describe that a bit?
PATIENT: It's just… tired. All the time. Like, even after a full night's sleep, I still feel like I could take a nap. And it's not just physical, it's… hard to focus too. Like, my brain feels foggy. It's worse in the afternoons, usually. And it's been getting… well, I guess it's been slowly getting worse over the last year or so. I just thought I was working too hard.
DOCTOR: Foggy brain and worsening fatigue… Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this – changes in appetite, weight fluctuations, feeling cold, or any trouble sleeping despite feeling tired?
PATIENT: Um… my appetite's been kinda off. Sometimes I don't feel hungry at all, and other times I feel like I could eat everything. I think I've lost a little weight, but I haven't really… checked. And I do feel cold a lot, even when it's warm. But… that could just be me? I’m always cold. Trouble sleeping… no, not really. I sleep okay, just… don't feel rested.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fluctuating appetite, unintentional weight loss, feeling cold frequently… These things are worth investigating, Ms. Bonck. I’d like to do a physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. It will just be routine – checking your heart, lungs, reflexes, and some basic neurological tests. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's wrong, if anything. I’m a little nervous, but… okay. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. After that, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please loosen your clothing so I can assess your back as well.
PATIENT: Okay. . It's kinda cold in here, isn’t it? I always feel cold… But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: It is a bit cool, yes. Now, if you could just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Pulse is 68. Temperature is 97.8. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, tell me where exactly does it hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, right there. Yeah, that’s it. And a little bit on both sides, but mostly right in the middle. It's not… sharp, just a dull ache. It feels… tight, almost like a knot. And it kinda shoots down my legs sometimes when I bend over.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine, with muscle spasm noted bilaterally. Forward flexion is limited due to pain. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, equal and symmetric. No clonus noted. Alright. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests. And I think an X-ray of your lumbar spine would be helpful to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood work and… an X-ray. Whatever you think is best. It sounds… good. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t really understand all the words, but… if you think it'll help, then yes. When can we do those things?
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab work can be done today, right here in the clinic. The X-ray will require a visit to the imaging center across the street – I’ll give you a referral. We should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory. These will help with the pain and muscle spasm. Now, I understand you mentioned some fatigue and feeling cold, and some memory issues. Given these symptoms, I’d also like to rule out any underlying hormonal imbalances. Therefore, I am referring you to an endocrinologist for further evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant, an anti-inflammatory… and an endocrinologist? That’s… a lot of doctors. I guess if you think it's necessary… yes. Okay. I just… hope it’s not anything serious. And where do I go for all of these things? I don't really remember what you said about where to go.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They will draw your blood. For the X-ray, here is a referral for the imaging center across the street - 123 Main Street. And here is the endocrinologist referral – Dr. Ramirez, at 456 Oak Avenue. The receptionist will schedule you an appointment when you call. I’ve also written down all the instructions on a summary sheet. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Um… I think that’s everything. It’s just… a lot to remember. And I get confused easily. Can I… call you if I forget something?
DOCTOR: The office number is on the summary sheet. You can call and speak with the nurse; she can answer most questions. I am often very busy with other patients. Now, I believe we’ve covered everything for today. Please follow up with these tests and appointments as soon as possible. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Bonck. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… try to remember everything. Bye. .
