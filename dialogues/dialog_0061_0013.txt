DOCTOR: Bula! Hello, Dondre. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my waterworks, mostly. I just… can’t seem to get it all out when I go. It's been happenin' for a little while now, and it’s… botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're having difficulty completely emptying your bladder when you urinate, and it’s been going on for a little while. “Waterworks” is a good way to put it. To help me get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not gettin’ it all out. It’s… it’s not painful, exactly. Just… feels like there’s still some left in there, even after I try. I have to… push a little, sometimes, to get the rest out. And then sometimes… it just stops, even if I think there should be more. It’s happened more often lately, I’d say. I don’t know how long “lately” is, exactly… a few weeks, maybe? Hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not painful, but you feel like you’re not fully emptying your bladder. You sometimes have to strain to get the last bit out, and it stops on its own even when you feel like there should be more. And this has been happening more frequently over the past few weeks. Thanks for sharing that, Dondre. Now, is there anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well… I get up a few more times at night than I used to. Not every night, but… often enough to notice. And I’m… drinkin’ less water, I guess. Just… tryin’ not to have to go so much. I know that ain’t good, but… it felt like the only thing to do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Dondre. You’re getting up more at night to urinate, and you’ve reduced your water intake to try and lessen the frequency. That's very helpful information. Now, have you noticed any changes in how you’re urinating – like a weak stream, or difficulty starting?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… the stream is a little weaker than it used to be, I think. It ain't a strong push, like it once was. And it takes a little bit… a moment, sometimes, to get it started. Not a long time, mind you, but not as quick as before. I just figured I was gettin' old!
DOCTOR: Getting older doesn’t automatically mean changes like this are just something you have to accept, Dondre. It’s good you mentioned that, though. A weaker stream and hesitancy in starting are important things to know. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve always been a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Had my share of colds, of course, and a little arthritis in my knees, but nothin’ serious. No big illnesses, nothin’ like that. I was seein' Doc Olsen back in Anchorage for years, but he retired… and I haven't really needed much since then. I get my Medicare check-ups, of course, but they haven’t found anything much. Oh, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy with some arthritis in your knees, and you had your appendix removed as a child. That’s helpful. The appendix removal isn't directly related to what you’re experiencing now, but good to know. Now, are there any medications you’re currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for the arthritis, Doctor. It's called… glucosamine, I think? Helps with the achin’ in my knees. And sometimes, when it's really bad, I take ibuprofen. Just when I need it, though, not every day. And… that’s it, I believe. I used to take somethin’ for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Said it was gettin' too low.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine for your knees and ibuprofen as needed, and you previously took medication for high blood pressure, but it was discontinued due to low blood pressure. Good to know. Now, about allergies… Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been able to eat whatever was put in front of me, and I haven't taken much medicine, so I haven't really had the chance to be allergic to anything, I suppose. I eat a lot of fish, being from Alaska, and I eat everything that comes with it. Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Dondre. No known allergies. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My wife… she used to, a long time ago, but she quit when we got married. It weren’t a good habit, she always said. And I always agreed with her. Been a long time now, since she… well, never mind. I just never had a taste for it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Dondre. No smoking history. That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little now and then, Doctor. Mostly on special occasions, or with friends. Not every day, and not much at a time. Just a beer, maybe, or a small glass of wine with dinner. I don't drink to excess, never have. It doesn’t agree with me much, if I have too much. Makes me a little sleepy, mostly. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional, moderate alcohol consumption. That's good to know. Now, regarding your family history… Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like prostate problems, bladder issues, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he had some trouble with his kidneys, when he got older. I don’t know exactly what, but he was always goin’ to the doctor for it. And my brother… he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself very well. My mother was healthy as a horse, as far as I know. And my wife’s family… well, I don’t know much about them, to be honest. We didn’t see them often. So, mostly just my father with the kidneys and my brother with the diabetes. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Dondre. History of kidney problems in your father and diabetes in your brother. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for these types of symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam, you say? Well… I suppose so. I haven’t had one of those in a while. A digital… what was that? Checkin’ my… prostate? Is that… necessary? I ain’t never had that done before. It sounds… uncomfortable. But if you say it’s necessary, Doctor, I trust your judgment. Just… tell me what you’re doin’, okay? And… be gentle, if you could.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. I completely understand your hesitation. A digital rectal exam allows me to assess the size and texture of your prostate. It can give us valuable information about what might be causing your symptoms. It’s a standard procedure, and I’ll explain everything as I go, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. We can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Okay, if you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you say it’s important… I’ll lie down. Just… let me know what you’re doin’, okay? And… be gentle, like you said. This ain’t somethin’ I’m lookin’ forward to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dondre. Just relax as much as you can. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first with my stethoscope. This won't be uncomfortable at all. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to ask you to take a deep breath in and out. Okay, still normal. Now for the digital rectal exam. I'm going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. Okay, just relaxing… taking a deep breath… Okay, all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. There are no obvious nodules or areas of concern. That’s good. However, the enlargement could be contributing to your symptoms. Now, let’s talk about what we’ve found and what our next steps should be.
PATIENT: Slightly enlarged, you say? That don’t sound good. Is that… serious, Doctor? What does that mean, exactly? And what are the next steps? Do I need… more tests? Or medicine? I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's botherin’ me, and I don't want it to get worse. What do you think is goin' on, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Dondre. A slightly enlarged prostate is very common, especially as men get older. It's often called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH for short. "Benign" means it’s not cancerous, and “hyperplasia” means an increase in the size of the prostate gland. It's not necessarily serious, but it can cause symptoms like difficulty urinating, a weak stream, and feeling like you can't empty your bladder completely, which are the symptoms you've been describing. To get a better understanding of the extent of the enlargement and rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for infection or other abnormalities. Second, a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. This test measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate prostate problems. And finally, I’d like to perform a flow rate test, where you urinate into a special container while we measure the speed and volume of your stream. These tests will help me determine the best course of action. Depending on the results, treatment options could range from lifestyle modifications and watchful waiting to medication or, in some cases, a procedure. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tests… urine analysis, PSA blood test, and a flow rate test. That’s… a lot of tests. But okay… if that’s what you think is necessary, Doctor, I’ll do them. I just want to know what’s goin’ on. Lifestyle modifications… what does that mean, exactly? And what kind of medicine are we talkin’ about? I ain't too keen on takin' a bunch of pills, if I can help it. Is there anything I can do now, though? To maybe make it a little easier? While I’m waitin’ for the tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the tests and medication. Let's talk about what we can do in the meantime. Lifestyle modifications involve some simple changes that can sometimes help alleviate symptoms. These include: Reducing your fluid intake before bedtime: This can help reduce the frequency of nighttime urination. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol: These substances can irritate the bladder and worsen symptoms. Regular exercise: Staying active can improve overall health and potentially reduce prostate inflammation. Double voiding: After you urinate, wait a few moments and then try to urinate again to help empty your bladder completely. Pelvic floor exercises : These exercises can strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and urethra. As for medication, there are several options available. Alpha-blockers can help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors can help shrink the prostate gland over time. But we'll discuss those options in more detail after we get the results of your tests. I'll write you a referral for the lab work and the flow rate test. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to prepare for each test. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… reduce fluids before bed, avoid caffeine and alcohol, exercise, double voiding, and pelvic floor exercises. That don't sound too bad. I can try that. I used to walk a lot, back when I was younger. Maybe I should start doin’ that again. Pelvic floor exercises… how do you do those, exactly? Is there somethin’ I can read about it? And the tests… where do I go for those? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm just a little anxious, you know? Want to get this sorted out as quick as I can. Will the nurse explain everything, or should I ask you before I go?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Dondre. It's perfectly normal to be anxious, and I'm glad you're asking questions. Let's talk about pelvic floor exercises, or Kegels. They're simple to do. Imagine you're trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that – those are your pelvic floor muscles. Hold the squeeze for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this exercise several times a day. You can do them sitting, standing, or lying down. There are plenty of resources online that can show you how to do them properly. I can print out a handout for you, or we can find a reliable website together. I’ll have the nurse provide you with all the necessary paperwork for the lab work and flow rate test. The lab is located just across the street, and the flow rate test is done here in the clinic. It usually takes a few days to a week to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. The nurse will explain everything in detail before you go, and she’ll answer any questions you have. However, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you think of anything else. We're a team in this, Dondre. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. It's a relief to know what's goin' on, even if it’s a little worryin'. I’ll see the nurse now, then. And I’ll try those exercises, and cut back on the fluids before bed. Hopefully, that’ll help a little bit. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help. And good luck with the exercises – they can make a real difference. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns along the way. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
