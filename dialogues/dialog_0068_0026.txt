DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s just…tiredness. A lot of tiredness. More than usual, even for an old woman like me. It comes and goes, but when it comes, I can barely lift a teacup. My husband keeps fussing, says I need to slow down…as if he understands what it's like to…well, I don't even remember what I was doing before I got tired! It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Alright, tiredness…and some memory lapses with that, it sounds like. How long has this been going on, this increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? That’s a good question. It feels like…a while. Months, certainly. Maybe longer? Everything’s a bit of a blur these days, you know? I used to be so sharp. Could remember every dive, every fish…now I struggle to recall what I had for breakfast! My husband says it’s been worse lately, though. He’s usually quite observant, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, months…and worsening recently. Has anything changed recently, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm…not really. We haven’t been travelling much, that’s for sure. Too expensive these days. The weather’s been awful, if you ask me. Damp and grey. And my grandson…he started that new job, I think. Something with computers? Honestly, all that technology…it’s just a waste of time. But no, nothing major. Just…life. Going on, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… well, my muscles ache a bit sometimes. Not constantly, but it’s there. And I’ve been a little clumsy lately. Dropped a perfectly good plate just last week, shattered it to smithereens. My husband wasn’t pleased. And…oh dear, what was I saying? Oh yes, aches. And sometimes I feel…a bit weak, like my arms won’t hold up. It's probably just old age catching up with me, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches, clumsiness, and weakness. Do you have any difficulty breathing, Ms. Oitker?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not particularly. I get a little winded climbing the stairs, but who doesn’t at my age? It’s not like I’m running marathons! My husband keeps telling me I need to exercise, but honestly, the thought of it… it exhausts me just thinking about it. Besides, I used to do plenty of physical work when I was a diver. More than enough, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. I don't like doctors poking and prodding, you know. Always something they find wrong. Still, if it gets me out of here quicker…go ahead. But be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat here. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Deep breaths… right. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like there’s a weight on my chest sometimes. Not a painful weight, just…heavy. Like I’m carrying a stone. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: I'm hearing some mild wheezing, Ms. Oitker. It's not severe, but it's something to note. Now I'm going to listen to your back. Take those same deep breaths. Anything painful when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, a little bit there, Doctor. Just a twinge. It’s been bothering me on and off for a few weeks now. My husband says I probably just slept on it wrong, but I don’t think so. It feels…deeper than that. More like a dull ache, you know? It doesn’t radiate or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, some tenderness there. Now, could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: There. Not very strong, are they? My husband keeps saying I need to build up my strength, but honestly, it’s exhausting just lifting them.
DOCTOR: Okay. And your reflexes seem a little diminished, Ms. Oitker. Everything is still within normal limits, but we'll want to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and Vitamin D level. We should also consider a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues, given the wheezing.
PATIENT: Blood work? An X-ray? Oh dear. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I knew it. I always knew something was wrong. My husband will be terribly worried. What are you looking for, exactly? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s best to rule things out, Ms. Oitker. The blood work will help us check for anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies, all of which can cause fatigue and weakness. The chest X-ray will simply give us a better look at your lungs. The blood draw will be a small prick, and the X-ray doesn't involve any pain. We’re just being thorough. I’d also like to get a detailed list of your medications, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Medications… well, let me think. There’s the one for my blood pressure, of course. And the one for my arthritis, when it flares up. Oh, and the little blue pill… for sleep. My husband says I snore too much. And… Oh, and sometimes I take something for indigestion. But honestly, I forget half the time. My husband usually keeps track of it all. He’s much more organized than I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll confirm everything with your husband. I’m going to write down the orders for the blood work and X-ray, and the nurse will schedule those for you. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend you try to get some extra rest and drink plenty of fluids. If your symptoms worsen – such as increased shortness of breath or chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Rest… extra rest. That sounds… nice. But honestly, I sleep all the time and still feel tired. And the emergency room… oh dear. I don’t want to go to the hospital. Increased shortness of breath… chest pain… I think I understand. But I'm sure it's nothing serious. Just old age, catching up with me. Are you sure it's not just…stress? My grandson is always getting into some sort of trouble. It keeps me up at night, worrying about him.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly contribute to fatigue, Ms. Oitker. However, given your symptoms – the tiredness, weakness, muscle aches, and wheezing – it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes. We'll get the test results back as quickly as possible and discuss them with you. In the meantime, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by stress, perhaps talking to a friend or family member could help. I am going to get you a referral for a social worker as well. Would you like me to write a note for your work as well?
PATIENT: A social worker? Is that… necessary? I don’t really talk about my feelings. Never have. Always kept everything bottled up. My husband would probably like that, though. He always says I need to open up more. No, no note for work. I don’t want anyone knowing anything. I can manage, I think. I always have. Just… get the tests done, please. That’s all I want. And tell me what’s wrong, so I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. We will get those tests done as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule them and answer any further questions you may have. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available. If anything changes before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening, at least. It’s nice to know someone is taking me seriously. I suppose I should be going now. My husband is probably wondering where I am. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Oitker. Please take care, and we'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
