DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I can’t really remember why I need it, just that someone told me to come. It’s… something to do with my health, I suppose. I get so mixed up these days. Can we just… get it done?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. Many patients find keeping track of appointments and tests a little challenging. We can definitely get that lab work done for you. To make sure we order the correct tests and have a good record, could you tell me who recommended the lab work?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… really don’t recall. Maybe it was the hospital? Or… a specialist? I see a lot of doctors, you know. Long story. Honestly, I wish I could be more help. Is it alright if you just… look it up? My Medicare should have everything, right? I just want to get this over with. It takes a lot out of me, these visits.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. That’s what the electronic records are for. Let me pull up your recent history and see what’s been ordered. Just give me a moment… Okay, here we are. It looks like Dr. Amiri, your cardiologist, requested a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a complete blood count. Those are pretty standard tests to monitor your overall health and check your heart function. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Amiri… yes, that name rings a bell. Heart… yes, I've had some issues with that. Those tests sound… fine, I guess. Whatever he wants is good with me. Look, is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, mind you, but… things. Can we just get the paperwork started? I'm not good with waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. We'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. The paperwork is mostly just confirming your insurance and allergies, and updating your current medications. I have a nurse who can draw your blood right away, and it shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. While we wait for the results, let’s just quickly go over a few things, just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Maybe… a slight reaction to penicillin, years ago? It wasn't bad, just a little rash. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’ve taken so many pills in my life, I can barely keep track. I just take what they tell me to take, you know? I don’t want to cause any trouble. Is this important? Can we skip it if it’s a long list? I'm feeling a bit… lightheaded.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel lightheaded, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll take our time. Knowing about the penicillin allergy is helpful, even if it was a mild reaction. It’s important for our records. We just need to confirm any other allergies, if there are any. And no trouble at all, we’ll make this as easy as possible for you. Are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… There’s… a pill for my heart, of course. A small white one. And something for my blood pressure, a blue one, I think. And… maybe something for my cholesterol? I get them all mixed up in the little pill organizer. My niece helps me with it, mostly. I really couldn’t tell you the names. It’s just a handful every morning. I don’t want to get the dosages wrong, that’s why I have her do it. Honestly, I just want to get this blood work done and go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Croonquist, that’s not too much to ask at all. It’s perfectly understandable to get confused with multiple medications. Knowing you have help with organizing them is good. We’ll make sure everything is accurate. Do you mind if I ask a few quick questions about your general health, just to get a better picture?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just… make it quick, please. My memory isn't what it used to be. Ask away, I suppose. But don't expect detailed answers. I mostly just try to avoid thinking about it, to be honest. It’s easier that way.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it brief. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Well, my knees ache sometimes, especially when it rains. And my back… oh, my back always aches. Old age, I suppose. It's just… a general soreness. Nothing specific, you know? I just take some over-the-counter pain relievers when it gets bad. It doesn't really go away, it just… lessens. Is that important? Can we move on? I'm starting to feel a bit… shaky. I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know, Mr. Croonquist. We'll note the knee and back pain. It's good you're managing it with over-the-counter medication. Let’s just quickly check if you’ve noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when my niece brings me food. Sometimes I don't feel very hungry, but I force myself. Weight… I have no idea. I haven't weighed myself in… well, a long time. I just wear the same clothes, so I guess if they still fit, everything is okay. Honestly, I just want this to be over with. I’m really not feeling well. Can we just get the blood drawn now? Please?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s get your blood drawn right away. I'll have the nurse come in and take care of that. She's very gentle and efficient. After that, we’ll just need a few minutes to review the results when they come back. Would you like a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Water would be good. And… maybe a chair with arms? I’m feeling a bit unsteady on my feet. Just… hurry, please. This is… unsettling. I don’t like feeling like this. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will be right in, Mr. Croonquist. Just take a few deep breaths and try to relax. We'll get you comfortable and take care of everything. We'll be as quick as we can. .
