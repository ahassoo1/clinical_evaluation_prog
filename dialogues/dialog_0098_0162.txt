DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t really have a lot of time, so I’ll just get straight to it. My stomach’s been… puffed up. Bloated, I guess you’d call it. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it’s been going on for a bit now. Don't really know why though.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Bloated” and “uncomfortable” – that gives me a starting point. And you said it’s been going on “for a bit now”?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit. Weeks, maybe? Honestly, things all kinda blend together these days. It's not like I sit around keeping a calendar of my gas, you know? It just…is. It's not painful, exactly, just…full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kristofik. “Full” even when you haven’t eaten much. Weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you, weeks. Maybe a month. It’s hard to say. It’s not like it came on suddenly, it just…gradually got worse. Honestly, doc, is this going to take long? I got things I need to be doing.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re short on time, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. Just trying to get a clear picture. Now, besides the bloating, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…what kind of symptoms? I mean, no, not really. I get tired, but who doesn't? And things…move through, if you know what I mean. Nothing different there. Just… bloated. That’s the main thing. And annoying. Really annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, “annoying” and “bloated”, and bowel movements are normal. No change in those. And you mentioned fatigue, but you feel that's unrelated?
PATIENT: Yeah, the tired thing is just…life, you know? Work is work. Pile driving isn't exactly a relaxing hobby. It’s not because of the stomach. Look, am I going to need tests or something? I really don't have time for all that. I just want to know what's causing the puffiness and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Kristofik. Let’s start with some basic questions, and then we can decide if any tests are necessary. Have you experienced any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. I eat what I always eat. Whatever’s quick and easy. Sandwiches, sometimes. Burgers. I don't sit around making fancy meals. It's not like I've started eating a ton of beans or something, if that’s what you’re getting at. This is getting ridiculous. I just feel bloated, doc. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major dietary changes. And you haven't started any new medications or supplements either?
PATIENT: Nope. I take a multi-vitamin sometimes, if I remember. That’s it. Look, my wife…she always made sure I took those. It’s hard to keep track of these things now, honestly. It’s been…a while. Can we just…skip the questions and get to figuring out what’s wrong? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik. Let me quickly review your chart… …Okay, I see you’ve had a general check-up a few years back. Now, about your bloating… have you noticed if anything specific makes it worse?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Like what? Certain foods? No. Stress? Maybe. Work's stressful. Everything's stressful. Honestly, it just happens. Sometimes it’s worse after I eat, sometimes it isn't. I wish I could pinpoint something, but I really can’t. I just know it’s uncomfortable and I want it gone. It's a waste of my time even trying to figure it out, isn’t it? I’m a pile driver, not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific triggers identified. And it seems stress may be a contributing factor. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for a bunch of poking and prodding. Seriously. I got a job to do. Is this going to help or not? I mean, you've asked me a million questions and I’ve told you nothing makes it worse, it just is. Are you gonna give me something to fix it or are we just gonna keep talking in circles? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize for the delay. Without a quick examination, it's difficult to determine the cause of your bloating. It could be something simple like gas, or something more complex. It is my professional obligation to gather sufficient information. However, I can offer a possible diagnosis and treatment plan based on what you've told me, but it will be less accurate without a physical assessment. Would you be willing to try that route?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just tell me what you think is wrong, and give me something to make it stop. I really don’t care what it is, as long as it works. And quickly, please. I got deadlines. This whole thing is ridiculous. Just…get on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on your description – bloating without specific triggers, and no reported changes in diet or bowel habits – it’s possible you’re experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. It’s a common condition, and stress can certainly play a role. Now, I want to be clear: this is a preliminary assessment. A more definitive diagnosis would require further testing, which we can discuss if the symptoms persist. For now, I recommend an over-the-counter medication called simethicone – it’s a gas reliever. You can find it at most pharmacies. Also, consider incorporating stress-reducing techniques into your daily routine, if possible. That could include deep breathing exercises or even just taking short breaks throughout the day. Here’s a handout with more information about IBS and simethicone. I’m also prescribing a short course of dicyclomine to help with abdominal cramping, if needed. If your symptoms don’t improve within a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, weight loss, or blood in your stool – please schedule a follow-up appointment immediately. Would you like me to provide a referral to a gastroenterologist at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Okay. Simethicone. Dicyclomine. Got it. Look, I don’t want a referral to some specialist. I’m a pile driver, not someone who needs fancy tests. I’ll try the pills. If they don’t work, I guess I’ll…deal with it. Is that all? Seriously. I really need to get going. And honestly, doc, I appreciate you not making me lie down and poke around, but this whole thing is still a waste of a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kristofik. I understand your concerns, and I’m glad I could provide some relief, even if it’s just a potential solution. Here's a work note excusing you for a few hours today to allow for medication side effects. Please, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve, don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, if you develop any new symptoms like fever or blood in your stool, seek immediate medical attention. Take care, Mr. Kristofik. .
