DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re thirty-three years of age. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Thirty-three. I need a letter, actually. Just confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming your ability to fly. I see. And is this for a specific airline, or… a more general requirement?
PATIENT: It’s for the airline, yes. Specifically, Air Mongolia. They… changed their policies recently. Something about needing a doctor’s note for international flights, even if you don’t look like you have any problems. It's a bit frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, these things happen. Airlines do have their protocols. To properly complete this, I’ll need some information from you, Ms. Sayar. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like heart problems, lung disease, or anything else that might be relevant for air travel?
PATIENT: No, not really. I was… healthy. My husband, he… he had some issues, but nothing on my end. I have Medicare, if that helps? Just in case. I’m widowed, by the way. That was a few years ago now.
DOCTOR: I see. Medicare is useful for billing, yes. And you state you have no prior medical diagnoses?
PATIENT: That’s right. Nothing diagnosed, no. I mean, I get the usual colds, but nothing serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while, honestly. Since… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries in the past, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. Just… regular check-ups when I was younger. Things like vaccinations. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… they’re mostly back in Mongolia. My parents are… getting older, naturally. They're both healthy, as far as I know. My brother had a bad flu a couple years ago, but he recovered. Nothing… serious like heart problems or anything. I don't think so, anyway. It’s hard to keep up from here.
DOCTOR: I understand. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Not even vitamins. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I just… I want to go home and see my family. This letter is the only thing stopping me.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sayar, while a lack of medical history is… generally a positive sign, Air Mongolia is requesting this documentation for a reason. To be thorough, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to ensure there are no underlying issues that might be contraindications to air travel. It will be quick. Do I have your permission?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. I understand. It just feels a little… unnecessary, but if that’s what they require… please, go ahead. I just want to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just step over here… First, I’d like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and respiration. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, a brief neurological assessment. Nothing to be alarmed about, simply a standard procedure. Please remain still, and try to relax. Blood pressure is 122/78. Within normal limits. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Respiration is normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Coordination appears intact. Everything appears unremarkable at this point, Ms. Sayar. However, I do note you appear somewhat… anxious. It might be prudent to… rule out any underlying psychological factors contributing to this concern.
PATIENT: Anxious? Oh, I am anxious! I’m trying to fly across the world to see my family after… well, a long time. And this whole letter thing is just… adding to it. It’s not a problem, Doctor, it’s just… stress. I just want a letter so I can go home. I’m not sure what psychological factors have to do with it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I assure you, I am approaching this with the utmost professionalism. While I understand your… distress, Air Mongolia requires assurance of your fitness to fly. It is my duty to provide that assurance, and that requires a thorough assessment. Given your recent history of… bereavement, and the documented anxiety, I would like to order a basic blood panel. Just to rule out any underlying deficiencies that might exacerbate these feelings. It’s a simple precaution. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A blood panel? Really? I just want a letter! I feel perfectly fine, except for being stressed about this whole thing. It’s… a bit much, isn't it? My husband… he didn't need a blood panel to fly. I’m starting to think this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, with all due respect, your late husband’s medical history is irrelevant in this situation. Protocols change, and I am obligated to adhere to them. A simple blood panel will provide a baseline assessment of your overall health, and will allow me to confidently state your fitness to fly. If you decline the blood panel, I am ethically obligated to state that I cannot, in good conscience, provide the requested documentation. It would be… irresponsible. However, if you agree, I can order it immediately. It will take approximately two business days to receive the results. Would you like me to proceed?
PATIENT: Two days? Two more days of waiting? Of course. Fine. Do it. Order the blood panel. Whatever it takes. Just… please, hurry. I just want to go home. This is… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. I have ordered the blood panel. The lab results will be sent to my office, and I will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I will prepare a preliminary letter stating that you are under my care and undergoing evaluation for fitness to fly. This will hopefully be sufficient for Air Mongolia in the interim. Are there any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… that’s everything. Just the results, please. And thank you… I think. I just… I hope this is over soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. You will be contacted as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Sayar.
