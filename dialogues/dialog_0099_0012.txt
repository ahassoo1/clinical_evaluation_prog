DOCTOR: Right. Velda Squiers, 45 years old. Well, let's get down to business. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Overgaard. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a rather nice one, actually – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor. Just some basic medical information, you understand. Nothing to worry about, I hope.
DOCTOR: A cruise, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. To the Mediterranean. I’ve always wanted to go. It’s with a friend, Mrs. Abernathy. We're leaving on the 15th of September. That's why I'm trying to get this form sorted out now, you see. I wouldn't want any last-minute difficulties.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the cruise line is being… thorough, I suppose. Forms are always a bother. Let's not waste time then. Do you have any significant medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Problems? Oh, well… not really. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets that, don’t they? And I twisted my ankle, oh, must be five years ago now. Nothing serious. I generally keep quite fit, walking every day. I do take a tablet for my blood pressure, though. Doctor MacIntyre prescribed it, about three years ago now. It’s… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small, white one.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril. Right. And how is your blood pressure generally?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s usually quite good, actually. Doctor MacIntyre says I need to keep an eye on it, and I do. I’ve got one of those machines at home, you know, with the cuff. I check it most mornings. It's usually around… well, it varies, of course. But generally, it’s not too high. He was happy with it at my last check-up, which was… April, I believe. April the 17th. I remember because it was Mrs. Abernathy’s birthday.
DOCTOR: And do you experience any symptoms related to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I mean, sometimes I get a bit of a headache, but everyone gets headaches, don't they? And occasionally my ankles feel a little swollen at the end of the day, but that's probably just from being on my feet all day with the displays, you see. I don’t feel dizzy or anything like that. Doctor MacIntyre never mentioned anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: Right. And what exactly do you do that requires you to be on your feet all day?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m a merchandise displayer. And window trimmer, you know. I arrange things in shop windows and inside the shops, to make them look nice. It's quite creative, actually. Lots of lifting boxes and moving things around, though. Especially around Christmas, it’s quite strenuous. I work for Harrisons, a department store in town. Been there twenty years now. A good steady job, but it can be tiring, of course.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else? Let me think… Oh! I take a vitamin D tablet during the winter months. Doctor MacIntyre suggested it, said it was good for the bones, especially as I don’t see much sunlight when I’m arranging displays. And sometimes, if my ankles are particularly sore after a long day, I take an over-the-counter painkiller. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. But not very often, you understand. Perhaps once or twice a month. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need to check your ankles. It’s just standard procedure, you understand.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m quite happy to do whatever you need. I do hope I haven’t bored you with all the details. I just like to be thorough, you see. It’s the way I was brought up.
DOCTOR: Right. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I'll start with your heart. Deep breaths now.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Deep breaths, you say? Right. In and out. Yes. In and out. Is that alright? I do hope I’m not breathing too loudly.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. A little murmur, grade one, not particularly concerning at this point. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but you do have a slight wheeze on expiration. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles. Could you point your toes upwards?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A slight wheeze, you say? I hadn't noticed. I do get a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, especially when the heating is on. Perhaps that’s what you’re hearing. Point my toes upwards, you say? Right. Is that alright? Do I need to push harder?
DOCTOR: There’s some mild pitting edema bilaterally, worse on the left. And some tenderness to palpation on the medial malleoli. Now, I need to check your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. Do you happen to know what it was at your last doctor’s appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me think… Doctor MacIntyre said it was a little high, actually. Around 140 over 90, I think it was. He said it wasn't anything to worry about, just to keep an eye on it. And I do, you know. I really do. Pit… pitting edema, you say? Is that bad? I do sit down when I get a chance, I assure you. My ankles do swell up a bit at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from being on my feet.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 150 over 95. That’s higher than your last reading, and certainly not ideal. Given your history and the physical exam findings, I’m a little concerned about early signs of heart failure. I think it’s important we investigate this further before you go on your cruise.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds… rather serious. I don’t feel ill, you know. Just a bit tired sometimes, perhaps. And my ankles swell, as we’ve discussed. I don’t understand. What sort of investigation? Will I have to… have tests? I do hope it’s not too disruptive. And will it mean I can’t go on the cruise? I’ve been looking forward to it for months.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does require some tests. An ECG to check your heart rhythm, and a blood test to check kidney function and a protein called BNP which rises when the heart is under strain. And I'd like you to have an echocardiogram – an ultrasound scan of your heart – to see how well it’s pumping. It’s standard procedure, and relatively non-invasive. As for the cruise… we need to know what we’re dealing with before making any decisions. It may be perfectly fine to go, but we can't take that chance without a proper assessment. I’ll write you a referral for these tests.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… a lot. An ECG, blood tests, an echocardiogram… I hadn’t anticipated all this. Will it take long to get the results? And is it very expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. Perhaps I should just cancel the cruise altogether. It would be simpler, wouldn’t it? Although Mrs. Abernathy would be terribly disappointed.
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn't take more than a week to schedule, and the results usually come back within a few days of the appointment. As for the cost… I’m aware you don’t have insurance. I can direct you to the clinic’s financial assistance program, and we can see if they can offer a discount. We can also discuss a payment plan. Cancelling the cruise is your decision, of course, but I wouldn’t recommend making it before we have some answers. I’ll also put a note on the referral requesting a priority appointment, given your travel plans. Now, let me finish this form, and I’ll explain the next steps.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you. A priority appointment would be wonderful. And the financial assistance program… that sounds very helpful, indeed. I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, you understand. Perhaps if I could just have a cup of tea, it would help me to feel a little better.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The lab and imaging center details are on this form, as well as the contact information for the financial assistance program. I’ll have the receptionist arrange a cup of tea for you. As I said, let’s get these tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to limit your salt intake and avoid strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant swelling in your legs, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. Limit salt and avoid strenuous activity… and go to the emergency room if… well, I’ll remember. Thank you again. I suppose I should call the lab and schedule the tests as soon as possible. Perhaps… perhaps I should cancel Mrs. Abernathy’s birthday dinner, too. It’s probably best not to overexert myself. .
DOCTOR: Right. Yes. That would be advisable. .
