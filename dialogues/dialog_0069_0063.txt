DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my back. It's been really, really hurting. It's... well, it's bad. I think it's worse than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your back is bothering you, and it seems to be worse than previous episodes. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It's... it feels like someone is stabbing me, but not all the time. More when I move. Or try to. Sometimes it's just a dull ache, but then... whoosh... sharp. It’s mostly in my lower back, but it goes down my leg sometimes. The right leg. It makes it hard to walk, even.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re experiencing both sharp, stabbing pains and a more constant dull ache in your lower back, and that pain radiates down your right leg. That makes walking difficult. When did this start, or when did you first notice it becoming worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe a week ago? It was just a little ache then, like the usual. But then, three days ago, it got really bad. Like... I couldn't get out of bed without help. That’s when I knew I needed to come in. It hasn’t gotten better since. Actually, maybe a little worse each day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started a week ago as a mild ache, significantly worsened three days ago to the point where you needed assistance getting out of bed, and it's been gradually worsening since then. Now, can you describe anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Okay... um... lying down flat seems to help a little. But not for long. And... when I try to bend over, oof, that’s the worst. Also, if I try to lift anything, even something light, it really hurts. Sitting for too long is bad too. Makes it stiff. Walking is okay for a little bit, but then it gets worse. It's hard to find a good position, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so lying flat provides some temporary relief, bending over and lifting exacerbate the pain, prolonged sitting causes stiffness, and walking is only tolerable for a limited time. Now, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Yes. A long time ago. Maybe... five years ago? I saw a different doctor then, in town. He said it was something with my back… a pinched nerve, I think? He gave me some pills and told me to do some exercises. It got better then, but it never really went away completely. This feels... worse than that time, though. A lot worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had a similar episode about five years ago, diagnosed as a possible pinched nerve, treated with medication and exercises, with some improvement but not complete resolution. And you feel this current episode is more severe. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Um... yes. I have… the doctor told me I have cancer. In my… well, he showed me. It's in my bones. It’s why I’m seeing you today. He said the back pain could be… from that. I take medicine for it. Pills. And I go for checkups. That doctor… Dr. Miller. He’s a good doctor. But he said I should come see you about the pain. Is that okay to talk about? It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, it’s perfectly okay to talk about it. Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Meigs. It’s very important information. I understand that discussing cancer can be difficult and nerve-wracking. You are doing the right thing by bringing it up. So, you are currently being treated for cancer that affects your bones, and the pain you're experiencing now may be related to that. Can you tell me what kind of cancer it is, if you know, and what medications you are taking for it?
PATIENT: It's... multiple myeloma, Dr. Miller said. Something with the bone marrow. It's… a bad one. And the pills… let me see. There's bortezomib... and dexamethasone. And calcium pills. Lots of calcium pills. He also gives me shots sometimes. It’s a lot to remember. But I try. He has a nurse who helps me keep track. Is that helpful information? I’m sorry if I'm rambling. I get scared when I talk about it.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful information, Ms. Meigs, and you're not rambling at all. It's perfectly understandable to feel scared when discussing this. Knowing you're on bortezomib, dexamethasone, and calcium supplements, and receiving injections, is crucial. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Does anyone in your family have cancer, particularly bone cancer or myeloma?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a hard question. My family... it’s complicated. I didn’t grow up with my father. And my mother… she didn’t talk much about her family. I know my grandmother on her side had some kind of sickness, a long time ago. But I don't know what it was. No one ever talked about it. And I don't really have any other close family to ask. So... I don’t know. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more. It's a blur, really. Everything about my family.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Meigs. It’s not always easy to have a clear picture of family medical history, and you’ve shared what you know. Okay, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Not since… well, a long time ago. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. Never have. I try to stay healthy. Even though… you know. It's hard. But I try to eat good food and get some exercise when I can. Mostly walking. When my back lets me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs, and you try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was little, but that was just pain. I've taken lots of different pills over the years, and never had any problems. I don’t have any food allergies that I know of either. I can eat pretty much anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Although... not with everything else. But allergies? No. Not that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to assess your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on. And if there’s something you can do to help. I’m ready. Just… be gentle, okay? It really hurts. But I’ll try my best to be still.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to start by having you lie flat on your back. Then I’ll ask you to move your legs and back in a few different directions. I'll also check your reflexes and sensation. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you significant pain. Okay, Ms. Meigs. Now, can you point your toes and flex your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It hurts a little, but I can do it. It feels… tight. Like something is pulling. Mostly on the right side. And… is it okay if I take a breath? I always forget to breathe when I'm nervous.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, please breathe normally. It's important to relax as much as possible. I see you’re able to point your toes and flex your feet, but there is some tightness and discomfort, particularly on the right side, as you mentioned. Now, can you try to lift your right leg straight up, keeping it as straight as you can?
PATIENT: Ooh! No! That hurts. Really hurts. I can’t do that. It’s like… a fire. Right down my leg. I think I pulled something. Please don't make me do that again.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, we’ll stop right there. No need to push through the pain. That’s very important information. The pain radiating down your leg with that movement suggests possible nerve involvement. Now, let's try a simple test. Can you tell me where you feel pain when I gently press on these areas of your lower back?
PATIENT: Right here… … that’s tender. And here… … that really hurts. Like a bruise, almost. And… when you press here… … it sends a shock down my leg. It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s… unsettling. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. But that’s where it hurts.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tenderness over those areas, particularly with the radiating pain down your leg when pressing on the spine, is significant. I also notice some muscle spasm in your lower back. Based on the physical exam and your history, it seems likely that your pain is related to nerve compression, potentially from a fracture or other bone-related issue given your multiple myeloma. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some imaging tests: an X-ray and an MRI of your lower spine. These will help us identify any fractures, compression of the spinal cord, or other abnormalities. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. If it can help me figure out what’s going on, and maybe get some relief… yes, please. X-ray and MRI… whatever you need. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I’m a little scared of… machines. And being stuck inside things. But I want to know what’s wrong. I just… I need to know. Is it covered by my insurance?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable to be anxious, Ms. Meigs. We’ll take it one step at a time. The X-ray is quick and painless – it’s just a brief exposure to radiation. The MRI takes a bit longer – about 30-45 minutes – and you’ll lie inside a large machine, but it’s not enclosed, and you'll have headphones to listen to music and a call button if you feel uncomfortable. As for insurance, yes, these tests should be covered by your private insurance. I will have my nurse verify your coverage and benefits and let you know if there are any out-of-pocket costs. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever and a muscle relaxant to help manage your discomfort. I also want you to avoid bending, lifting, or twisting until we have a clearer diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Pain reliever and muscle relaxant… that would be wonderful. And I will be careful. No bending, lifting, or twisting. I can do that. I think. It's hard sometimes, because… well, I still need to do things. But I will try my best. Do you think… do you think it's serious? The pain, I mean. Is it something we can fix? Or is this… is this how it’s going to be now? I know you probably can’t tell me for sure yet, but… just your honest opinion, if you don’t mind. I just… I need to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, it's understandable that you're worried, and it's good you're asking these questions. Given your history of multiple myeloma, the pain could be related to a fracture or compression of the vertebrae, which is a common complication of the disease. However, it’s also possible it's not related to the myeloma, or it's a less severe issue. Until we have the results of the imaging tests, I can’t give you a definitive answer. The goal of the tests is to determine the cause of the pain and create a treatment plan. There are many options available, depending on the diagnosis – from pain management and physical therapy to more advanced interventions. I want to be honest with you: your pain is significant, and we need to address it. But I also want to reassure you that we’ll work together to find the best solution for you. We won’t give up until we have a clear understanding of what's going on and a plan to manage your pain and improve your quality of life. For now, let’s focus on getting you some relief with the pain medication and muscle relaxant, and avoiding activities that worsen your pain. We'll discuss the imaging results as soon as they’re available. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. I think. I just… thank you. For being honest. And for not… giving up. I appreciate that. Okay. Pain medication… and no bending, lifting, or twisting. I will try my best. And I will wait for the results. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you very much, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been very kind. I just hope… I just hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Remember, we’ll work through this together. My nurse will be in shortly to give you the prescriptions and provide further instructions. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, Ms. Meigs, and please take care of yourself. .
