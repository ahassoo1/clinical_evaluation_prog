DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It's good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good… good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a… a permission slip, I guess you’d call it. For a little… touch-up. A cosmetic thing. That's all.
DOCTOR: A permission slip?
PATIENT: Yes! That's what the lady on the phone said I needed. To make sure I’m… healthy enough. For it. I don't know why I need a doctor for somethin’ like this, but she said it was required. I just want to get it done and be on my way. It's… personal. Really personal.
DOCTOR: I see… Okay. Well, to make sure you’re healthy enough, I'll need to ask a few questions, standard procedure, even for… cosmetic things. It helps us understand your overall health and prevent any complications. I apologize for the delay, but it's important. Could you tell me a little more about this “touch-up” you’re planning?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I really don't see how my health has anything to do with this. It's… a little somethin’ to improve my appearance, that's all. And frankly, it's none of your business what it is. I just need you to sign the paper and let me go. I got better things to do than sit here explainin’ myself. What kind of questions are we talkin’ about anyway? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I truly do. It’s not my intention to pry, but even with cosmetic procedures, we need to make sure there aren’t underlying conditions that could cause problems. For example, certain medications or skin conditions could affect the outcome, or even be affected by the procedure. It's about your safety. Let’s start simply. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. I take a little somethin’ for my… joints, sometimes. Old age, you know? But that's it. I ain’t one for all them fancy pills. Just the one. And I don’t remember what it's called. Been takin’ it for years. Look, is this gonna take long? I got appointments, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your joints. Do you remember why you started taking it?
PATIENT: Why? Well… because they hurt! What kind of question is that? Old age, Doctor! Things wear out. Bones ache. I don't need a doctor to tell me that. I started takin' it when… well, when they started botherin' me a whole lot. Years ago. A long time ago. Can we please just get this over with? I swear, this is more trouble than it’s worth.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: Diabetes? High blood pressure? Look, I eat my greens, I walk around a bit… I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age! Don’t go lookin’ for things that aren’t there, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I take care of myself. I don't need a lecture. Just sign the paper! This is absurd.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a few more questions, Mr. Honcoop. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No! Absolutely not. I’m a practical man, not one for… cuttin’ and slicin’. Never needed anythin’ like that. Why are you askin’ all these questions? You’re makin’ me nervous. I just want this permission slip, and I want to go! This is a waste of my time. A complete and utter waste.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What does my family have to do with any of this? Look, I haven't spoken to most of them in… years. It's complicated. And frankly, it's none of your concern. They got their own problems. I'm here for my permission slip, not to give you a family history. I'm a single man, always have been. Is this over yet? I swear, this is getting ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I need to ask these questions to ensure your safety. You mentioned not being to a doctor in a long time, and while I respect your independence, it's important to have a basic understanding of your health. Given your age and the fact you haven’t seen a doctor recently, and you are requesting a procedure of some sort, I am a little concerned. I’m hesitant to sign this permission slip without a more thorough examination, just to rule out any potential complications. Perhaps we could start with some basic vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, maybe listen to your heart and lungs?
