DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Hartness, yes. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: What? You don't know why I'm here? It's on the paper, isn't it? Military exam. I need to pass it. Pretty simple, really. Don't they tell you things before you call me in? It's a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, paperwork doesn’t always… translate. And frankly, a “military exam” is quite broad. I need you to tell me what specifically needs to be assessed. Are there particular concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? Look, I'm in good shape. Always have been. Worked with engines my whole life. Strong hands, good eyes. I don't have concerns. They want me to check I'm...fit. That's it. It's a formality, probably. But I need to be sure, you know? Can't get held back by some little thing. So, check me. Everything. Just...do the test. What do you need from me first?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "everything" is…unhelpful. But fine. Let's start with a basic history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? What does that mean? I had a bad flu once, when I was a kid. And I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was ages ago. Other than that...no. Nothing. I don't sit around going to doctors for every little sniffle. Waste of money. Is that good enough? You need dates or something? I don't remember exactly when I had the flu. A long time ago, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. No major medical history. And the broken arm… when approximately did that occur?
PATIENT: Probably...around ten years old. Maybe eleven. It was winter. Lots of snow. I was climbing an apple tree in my neighbor's yard. Stupid thing, really. Always liked climbing trees. It healed fine, though. Bone knitted up good as new. You don’t need to write all that down, do you? It’s just a broken arm.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had any surgeries. Why would I have surgeries? I told you, I don't go to doctors. You fix things, I don’t need fixing. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I’ve got things to do, you know. This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. Family history, then. Any significant medical problems in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: Immediate family... My father had high blood pressure, I think. He smoked too much. And my mother... she had bad knees when she got older. Arthritis, maybe? She was always complaining. Neither of them were very healthy, honestly. Lived a long life though, so I guess it didn't kill them. Is that what you want to know? Everything’s always something with people getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, like I said, and it didn't do him any good. Bad for your lungs, you know? I need my lungs. For working. And…well, for other things. Don't need to know that, though. So, no. I don't smoke. Next question. Are we getting closer to actually doing the exam?
DOCTOR: Right. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I hardly ever take anything. A painkiller for a headache maybe, years ago. And some cream for a rash once. But I don’t remember what they were. Never had a bad reaction to anything, though. I’m pretty tough. I don’t go around being allergic to everything. Honestly, you're asking a lot of silly questions. It's like you think I'm some kind of…invalid.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Current medications?
PATIENT: Look, I just told you! No medications. None! I don't take anything regularly. Do you even listen? This is ridiculous. I need to get this exam done, and you’re just asking me the same things over and over. I don't understand what the point of all this is. It’s a waste of my time and yours. Are we finished with the questions yet?
DOCTOR: Fine. Let’s move on to the physical exam. Please step onto the scale. We’ll start with height and weight.
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Don't take too long, alright? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Your height is 187 centimeters, and your weight is 53 kilograms. That’s…rather low for your height. Blood pressure is 110 over 70. Pulse is 60 and regular. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: What do you mean, “rather low”? I’m a lean machine! Always have been. Strong, not fat. You don't need to look at me like that, alright? Hurry it up. I'm not sick, I'm just…efficient. Is that what you call it? Efficient! Now, what next?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds normal. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Please sit on the examination table and relax.
PATIENT: Relax? I am relaxed. Just get it over with. I don’t have all day, you know. What are you checking for, anyway? This feels…pointless. Like you’re just going through the motions.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to quickly check your range of motion. Can you please raise your arms overhead?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that good enough? Honestly, this is…undignified. I build engines, I don’t…flap my arms around. What does that even prove? Can we just skip to something more…useful? Like, I don't know, a strength test? Or something that actually matters?
DOCTOR: Range of motion is adequate. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart again. Everything sounds normal. Although, I am a little concerned about your weight. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Recent weight loss? No! I haven't lost weight. I'm always this weight. Maybe you’re just…reading the scale wrong? It’s a small number, easy to misread. I eat plenty, alright? Good food, plenty of protein. Builds muscle. I told you, I'm efficient! Not wasting space with extra…padding. What's the point of all this fuss about my weight, anyway? It doesn't stop me from doing anything. Does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your low weight and the fact that you’re seeking a military exam, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. A complete blood count and a metabolic panel. It's just a precaution, Mr. Hartness. We need to ensure you're in optimal health.
PATIENT: Blood work? Now you want blood? What’s wrong with me? I told you, I’m fine! This is getting ridiculous. I don't need poking and prodding. I need to pass this exam, not become a science experiment. Are you saying I’m not healthy enough? Because I assure you, I am. This is a waste of time and money! I don't understand why you're making such a big deal out of nothing. Just tell me if I pass or fail, alright? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a duty to ensure you're in good health before certifying you for any physically demanding activity. Without blood work, I cannot ethically sign off on your exam. I recommend you schedule an appointment with the lab downstairs.
