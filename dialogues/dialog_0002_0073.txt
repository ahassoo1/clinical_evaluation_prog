DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. It’s… it’s my stomach. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and it’s just… not stopping. It’s been going on for weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weeks of frequent bathroom trips – that definitely sounds frustrating. “Everything the drugstore sells” is pretty broad though – can you tell me a little more specifically what you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need details? Fine. I took… I don’t know, Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, those little pink pills… Kaopectate, I guess? Honestly, they all just seem to make it worse. And some herbal stuff my sister gave me, something with… chamomile? It tasted awful, and didn’t do anything. Look, I just want it to stop. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, wanting it to stop is not too much to ask! And it's helpful to know what you've already tried, so we don’t repeat things. So, you’ve tried Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate, and a chamomile herbal remedy. Okay. Can you describe what the bathroom trips are like?
PATIENT: Honestly? Messy. And… a lot. It’s not just a little bit, it’s… a lot of water. And it’s… I don’t know, cramping. Bad cramping before, during, and after. It wakes me up at night sometimes. I’ve been trying to drink water, but even that feels like a bad idea half the time. It just… goes right through me. Is this something serious? Because I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, messy, frequent, watery stools with cramping that’s waking you up at night… that definitely sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. It could be something serious, but it could also be a number of things. To help me narrow it down, let’s go through some more questions, if you don't mind. First, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need to ask that? Look, I'm not one for details. But… no. No blood. It’s just… watery. And… a weird color, sometimes. Pale, almost. But no blood. I would notice blood. Is that what you were getting at? Just tell me what's wrong and how to fix it. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the questions feel too personal. It's just that these details are important for me to figure out what’s going on. Pale stools are a detail I was curious about, thank you for mentioning that. Okay, no blood. Let's talk about other things. Have you had a fever recently, or felt nauseous or vomited?
PATIENT: No fever. And no, I haven't thrown up. I feel… weak, mostly. And tired. Really tired. Like I haven't slept in days, even when I have. And… my appetite is gone. Everything just tastes… wrong. Look, it’s just my stomach, okay? It’s constantly upset. Why does this need to be a whole investigation?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vomiting, just weakness, fatigue, and loss of appetite alongside the constant stomach upset. I appreciate you telling me all of this. It's not just "just your stomach," though - those other symptoms are important clues. To get a better picture, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now we’re going way back? Look, I had pneumonia when I was a kid, a really bad case. And… my husband, he passed away a few years back. Heart problems. But other than that… no. Nothing major. I'm a pretty healthy person, usually. This is just… weird. Is it a virus? Is that what you’re thinking? Because I really don't have time to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia as a child, and your husband’s heart problems – I’m sorry for your loss, by the way. And you generally consider yourself healthy. A virus is a possibility, yes, but we need to rule out other things. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or eaten anything unusual?
PATIENT: No! I haven’t gone anywhere. I live here. Rural, remember? And I eat… normal food. I haven’t been trying any fancy restaurants or anything. Just… regular stuff. I’m telling you, it’s just my stomach. I think you’re making a big deal out of nothing. Honestly, I think I just need something to stop it now. Is there anything you can give me? I'm starting to feel really weak.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I do want to help you feel better. I'm not trying to make a big deal out of it, but it's important to be thorough, especially since this has been going on for weeks. I'm thinking it's time for a physical exam. Would you be comfortable if I listened to your abdomen, and checked for any tenderness?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I have things to do. But don’t expect me to be happy about this. And please be quick. I really don't have time to lie around all day. And… be gentle, okay? This is already awful enough.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie back on the exam table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen in four different spots. It might be a little uncomfortable if you’re tender, but please let me know if it's painful. Okay. I'm hearing some… increased bowel sounds, which is consistent with what you’re describing. There’s some tenderness in your lower abdomen, on the left side. Not severe, but definitely present. Your abdomen is also slightly distended. To be sure, I think we should run some tests. I'd like to order a stool sample to check for infection or parasites, and a blood test to check for dehydration and inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Really? Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just a bug. And I really need something to stop this now. I can't keep running to the bathroom. I have a life, you know. Just… let's get this done. Can I at least get something for the cramping? This is miserable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we'll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The tests will help us pinpoint the cause and get you the right treatment. For the cramping, I can prescribe you an antispasmodic medication. It won't stop the diarrhea completely, but it should help to ease the pain. I’ll also recommend you continue to drink plenty of fluids, even if it’s just small sips, to prevent dehydration. I’m going to give you a prescription for hyoscyamine, 0.125 mg, take one tablet every four to six hours as needed for cramping. I'll also have the nurse draw the blood, and give you a container for the stool sample. I want you to know that if you start experiencing a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. This could be a sign of something more serious. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Hyoscyamine. Fine. Just… make sure it works. And… no, I don't have any questions. Just… get it over with. I really need to get home. This is taking up my whole day. Honestly, I’m starting to feel really weak. Just… where do I go for the blood draw? And… is the stool sample… complicated? I really don’t want to deal with anything complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. The nurse’s station is right outside the door, and they’ll get you set up for the blood draw. It’s a simple procedure, and shouldn’t take long. As for the stool sample, it’s not complicated at all. The nurse will give you a container with instructions, and you’ll just collect a small amount of stool after your next bowel movement. There’s a special lid to help contain the odor. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me the medication, and get me out of here. I really need to get home. This has been a waste of my whole day. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's just my stomach. But… thank you. I guess. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have the nurse get everything ready for you right away. And again, don't hesitate to call if anything changes. I hope you feel better soon, Triana. .
