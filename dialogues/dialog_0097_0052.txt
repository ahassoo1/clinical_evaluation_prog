DOCTOR: Good morning, Aurthur. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet ye as well. Well, it's this nausea, really. Been happenin' most mornings now, for a couple o' weeks. It's not a proper sickness, just… feelin’ queasy when I wake up. And the heart… well, ye know about the heart, don’t ye? Been a bit troublesome lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see here you've been followed for some cardiac concerns. Okay, so nausea most mornings for a couple of weeks, and some trouble with your heart. Let's unpack that a bit. When you say “troublesome,” can you describe what's happening with your heart?
PATIENT: Aye, right ye are. Well, it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… a flutterin’, ye ken? Like a wee bird trapped in me chest, sometimes. And a bit o' breathlessness if I’m walkin’ up a hill. It’s been worse on and off, and I just… I thought it best to get it checked, with the nausea comin’ on top o' it. It just feels different than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttering sensation in your chest, like a bird, and some breathlessness with exertion. And you feel this is different than previous episodes with your heart. That's good you came in to get it checked. Let's get a bit more detail. Does anything specifically bring on the fluttering or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not really anythin’ specific, I don't think. It seems to just… happen. I’ve noticed it sometimes after I eat, but not always. And maybe a bit more if I've been tryin’ to do too much in the garden. I do enjoy me gardenin’, ye see. But liftin’ heavy pots, that can get me a bit winded. But it’s no’ like it always happens then, either. It's just… unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be somewhat related to activity, particularly after eating or exertion like gardening, but it’s not a consistent trigger. And unpredictable, as you said. Now, tell me about the nausea. Is it with every meal, just breakfast, or does it happen at other times?
PATIENT: No, not with every meal, thankfully. Mostly just in the mornin’, like I said. I'll wake up and just feel… unsettled, ye ken? No stomach cramps or anythin’, just a queasy feelin’. It usually passes after I’ve been up for a while and had a bit o' toast and a cup o’ tea. It's no’ a violent sickness, just… unpleasant. It’s been worryin’ me though, with the heart trouble as well. Makes ye think, ye see.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially with the heart issues on top of the nausea. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. Now, let’s go over some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Aye, I have, actually. I’ve no’ been eatin’ as much as usual. No’ because I feel sick all the time, just… no much hunger, ye see? And I think I’ve lost a wee bit o’ weight. No' a lot, mind ye. But my trousers are feelin’ a bit looser than they were a month or two ago. I haven’t been weighin’ myself regularly, but I can definitely feel the difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some unintentional weight loss. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. Everything's been fairly regular, if ye ken what I mean. No’ constipated or anythin’ like that. Just… normal, as far as I can tell. I’ve no’ been payin’ much attention, if I’m bein’ honest. It’s the nausea and the heart that’s been worryin’ me, no’ so much other things. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It is important to ask about everything, Aurthur, just to get a full picture. But it's good to hear your bowel habits haven't changed. Alright, let’s talk about past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we’ve not discussed, besides the heart trouble?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a touch o’ the arthritis in me knees a few years back, but it’s been fairly mild. And I had me appendix taken out when I was a wee lad, but that was a long time ago. Aside from that, no. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, to be honest. Always kept active, enjoyed me gardenin’ and a good walk in the hills. That’s why this is all so worryin’, ye see. It’s not like me to feel this… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees and appendectomy in childhood. And you’ve generally been a healthy, active man. That gives me a good baseline. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the appendix, when I was a young lad. And I’ve no’ been in hospital for anythin’ significant since then. I did have a bad bout o’ the flu a few years back, but that was just a few days in bed with a hot toddy. No serious procedures or anythin’ like that. I'm a fairly simple case, Doctor, really. Just a bit o' bother with the heart, and now this nausea.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stomach problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Aye, there is, actually. Me father… he had a bad heart, ye see. Had to have a wee operation for it when he was in his sixties. And his brother… he had stomach ulcers, I think. Spent a fair bit o' time in hospital for them. And me mother… she had diabetes, but that was later in life. No' much else, to be honest. A few bad backs and a bit o' arthritis, but not much serious. Does that help, Doctor? I always worry about takin' after me father with the heart trouble.
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. Knowing about your father's heart issues and your uncle’s ulcers is important. And your mother’s diabetes, too. Okay, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ for me, thank ye very much. Gave that up years ago. I do enjoy a wee dram o’ whisky now and then, but only one or two in the evenin’, and no' every night. And no drugs, no. Just the occasional dram o' whisky for a bit o' warmth. I try to keep myself fairly healthy, as I said. And I'm a bit too old for any o' that nonsense anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional whisky, but no smoking or drugs. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a good question. Let me think… I’m takin’ Ramipril for the heart, that’s 5mg once a day. And I take a wee tablet called Bisoprolol, 2.5mg, also for the heart. And I sometimes take paracetamol for me knees if they’re botherin’ me, but no’ regularly. That’s it, I think. No’ much else. And no’ any fancy supplements or anythin’ like that. Just the tablets the doctor’s given me for the heart, and the occasional paracetamol.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ramipril 5mg and Bisoprolol 2.5mg for your heart, and paracetamol as needed for your knees. Excellent. Thank you for providing all of that information, Aurthur. That gives me a very clear picture of your health history. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Then we’ll talk about what might be going on and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Do what ye need to do. I'm happy to help in any way I can. I trust yer judgment, and I’m glad ye’re takin’ this seriously. It’s a relief to be gettin' it checked out. Just let me know if there’s anythin’ I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Aurthur. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur, which we already know about. Your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper left quadrant, but no significant masses or distension. No obvious signs of organomegaly. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, the nausea and the heart symptoms together are concerning. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address. Several things could be going on. It could be related to your heart condition, a side effect of your medications, or something else entirely. Given your family history and the tenderness in your abdomen, I want to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level. I also want to do an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. And, just to be cautious, I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what ye think is best, then I trust yer judgment. Blood work, EKG, and an ultrasound… gettin’ a good look at everything seems a good idea. I’d rather be safe than sorry, as they say. Just… will these tests be painful? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I’m a bit worried about what they might find, but I know ye’re doin’ yer best. I appreciate that, Doctor, I really do.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Aurthur. The blood work will just involve a small prick in your arm – a bit of a sting, but it shouldn't be painful for long. The EKG is completely painless – we just stick some stickers on your chest. And the abdominal ultrasound is non-invasive – we use a gel and a probe to look at your organs, and it doesn't hurt at all. As for the results, the blood work should be back within a couple of days. The EKG results will be available almost immediately. The ultrasound usually takes a bit longer, maybe a week or so, depending on the availability of appointments. We'll discuss the results as soon as they're available, and we'll figure out the best course of action together. It's good you're thinking about this proactively. And you're right to be concerned, but we're going to take things one step at a time. I'll write up the orders for the tests now, and the nurse will come in and explain the process to you. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Small prick for the blood work, stickers for the EKG, and gel for the ultrasound… sounds manageable. And I'll come straight to the emergency room if there's any chest pain or bad trouble with me breath. I appreciate ye takin' yer time to explain everything so clearly. It puts me mind at ease a bit, knowin’ what to expect. And thank ye again for takin' this seriously. I'm glad I came in today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aurthur. That’s what I'm here for. I’m glad you came in too. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly with the paperwork for the tests. If you have any questions at all before she comes, please don’t hesitate to ask. .
