DOCTOR: Hi Mykeisha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Georgiou, nice to meet you too! Well, the nurse took my blood pressure earlier and it was kinda high, she said. That's why I'm here, to figure out what's going on with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to check out. And it's smart of you to get it looked at. Do you usually monitor your blood pressure at home, or was that reading the first time you’ve had it checked recently?
PATIENT: No, I don't have one at home. That was the first time I checked it in a long time, honestly. I usually only get it checked when I go for my yearly check-up, and that was… last year, I think. Everything was fine then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a bit of a new thing then. And yearly check-ups are great, it's good you keep up with those. Just to get a better picture, have you been feeling any different lately?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really, I don't think so. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just 'cause it’s been so hot. You know? And work’s been busy.
DOCTOR: Right, that makes sense. Heat and a busy workload can definitely take a toll. Just to be thorough, when you say tired, is it a general feeling of fatigue, or something more specific – like trouble sleeping, or feeling weak?
PATIENT: Just... tired, you know? Like, I could nap all day and still feel wiped. Not really trouble sleeping, I sleep okay. And I wouldn't say weak, just… heavy, if that makes sense. Like my body is just dragging.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” is a good way to put it. And it’s good to know you're sleeping alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of – things like diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. The nurse asked, and I told her the same thing. I had the flu a couple years back, but that’s it. Oh! And my grandma had high blood pressure, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Good to know you haven't had any major medical issues. And family history definitely matters. So your grandma had high blood pressure…do you know if anyone else in your family has it, or had it?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mom had it, I think. She was on some pills for it for a while, but she passed away a few years ago. And my uncle on my dad's side, too. He was always careful about his salt.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A family history of high blood pressure does increase your risk. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take something for my allergies when the pollen count is bad, but that’s it. Nothing regular, like a prescription or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And no known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I haven’t had any problems with anything before.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. . Take a few deep breaths for me, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Your heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your pulse. Pulse is 78, regular. Blood pressure is 142/90. Hmm, still a bit elevated. I’m also going to take a look at your throat and ears. Open your mouth and say “ah.” Looks good, no swelling or redness. Ears also look clear. And finally, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness. Everything feels normal there.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds good. Is 142/90 bad? I don't really know what those numbers mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, good question. Those numbers are a little higher than we’d like to see. Ideally, we want blood pressure to be around 120/80 or below. 142/90 puts you in Stage 1 hypertension. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you need to panic, but it does mean we need to investigate a little further and figure out what’s causing it, and how best to manage it. Let me pull up your record from the nurse. Just to be sure, do you have any kidney problems or diabetes that you know about?
PATIENT: Nope. I already told the nurse, I don’t. I mean, I've never been told I have either one. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. And I try to drink enough water.
DOCTOR: Okay, the nurse’s notes confirm that. Good. Now, sometimes, a single high reading can be due to stress or anxiety. Were you particularly stressed or worried before or during your appointment today?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little nervous, maybe, 'cause I don’t usually go to the doctor. But not stressed. Work was okay yesterday, and I had a relaxing evening watching TV. Just a normal day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given that your blood pressure is consistently elevated, and you have a family history of hypertension, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your high blood pressure – things like kidney disease, thyroid problems, or electrolyte imbalances. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels, just to get a complete picture of your cardiovascular health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? Will the blood tests tell me if I need to take pills or something?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. And yes, the blood tests will help us determine the best course of action. It’s possible you may need medication to lower your blood pressure, but that's not necessarily the case. Lifestyle changes – like diet, exercise, and stress reduction – can often be very effective in lowering blood pressure, and we’ll discuss those options as well. I’ll give you a lab order now. The nurse will walk you through where to go for the blood draw. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. A few days is okay. I’m glad you’re not jumping straight to pills. Thank you, Dr. Georgiou. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. We'll take things one step at a time. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll have the nurse bring in the lab order now.
