DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, I requested to come in… to get tested for HIV, if you don’t mind. It’s… something I wanted to do, just to be sure, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very sensible thing to do, and I commend you for taking proactive steps regarding your health. It’s perfectly alright to want to be sure. Before we proceed with the testing, could you tell me a little bit more about why you’re requesting it now?
PATIENT: Hm. Well, it’s not that anything specific happened, Doctor. It’s just… my husband and I, we’ve been married a long time. A very long time. And… well, things change, don't they? I thought it was a good time to just… check, you know? Make sure everything is as it should be. It's been a while since either of us has been tested, and with my age, I figured it wouldn’t hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very thoughtful approach – regular check-ups are always a good idea, especially with changes over time. It’s wise to be proactive about your health, and there's absolutely no shame in wanting to be certain, regardless of your age or marital status. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your husband's health status?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband, Adebayo? He’s… generally healthy, thank goodness. He sees his doctor regularly for his blood pressure, it’s been a little high lately, but he takes his medication. He hasn't had any… major illnesses, thankfully. We both try to eat well, though it’s harder as we get older, you know? And we’re not… active, shall we say, as we used to be. He hasn’t been tested for anything specifically in… oh, I’d say at least five years, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Shaub. That's helpful information. And it's good to hear that your husband is generally healthy and takes care of his blood pressure. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I’ve been quite blessed, really. I had a bout of malaria when I first moved to this country, many years ago, but that cleared up completely. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, things like that. But nothing chronic. I’ve always been quite strong, I suppose. I used to be a very active woman, before… well, before things slowed down. I do get a little ache in my knees sometimes, but I blame that on the weather!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Shaub. It sounds like you've been very fortunate with your health overall. And a bout of malaria when you first moved here – that's certainly something. Knee aches with the weather are very common, you're not alone there! Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for any reason other than the malaria?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no surgeries. And no hospital stays besides when I was recovering from the malaria. It was quite frightening at the time, I remember. It was a very different time then, the medical care wasn't as good as it is now, thankfully. But aside from that, I’ve been very lucky. I’ve always been a strong believer in good food and a good night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Shaub. It sounds as though you’ve maintained good health habits throughout your life, which is wonderful. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication, Doctor. A small dose, as prescribed by my regular doctor. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to keep things ticking over, you understand? Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly sore, I take ibuprofen. That's all, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. Blood pressure medication, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed – that’s a relatively straightforward list. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. I don’t have any known allergies. I've always been able to eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I consider myself quite lucky in that regard, as well. My sister, on the other hand… she’s allergic to everything! But me, no. None at all.
DOCTOR: Wonderful, Ms. Shaub. That’s very good to know. No known allergies is certainly a positive. Okay, so to summarize, you are requesting HIV testing as a precautionary measure after a long marriage, your husband has managed blood pressure, you have a history of malaria but no chronic conditions or surgeries, you take a small dose of blood pressure medication, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed, and you have no known allergies. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is absolutely correct. You’ve got it all perfectly. I appreciate you taking the time to go through everything so thoroughly. It's reassuring to know you’ve got a good understanding of my situation. So… what happens next? Will I have some blood taken?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It's my pleasure to ensure I have a complete picture of your health. Yes, for the HIV test, we will need to draw a small sample of blood. There are different types of tests we can do. The most common is an antibody test, which can detect if your body has produced antibodies to fight the virus. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. We can also do a more advanced test that detects the virus itself, but that might take a little longer. Do you have any preferences on which test you would like?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, I don’t know much about those things, Doctor. Honestly, I just want to get it done, you understand? If you have a recommendation… I trust your judgement. Whatever is most accurate, and doesn’t take too long, I suppose. I’m not particularly fond of needles, if I’m being honest, but I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. In your case, I recommend we start with the antibody test. It's very accurate, reliable, and we typically get the results back within 3 to 5 business days. It is also the standard test for initial screening. Before we proceed, I want to inform you about the procedure. A phlebotomist will clean the area on your arm, insert a needle, and draw a small amount of blood into a tube. There might be a slight pinch, but it's usually quick. Afterward, there might be a little bit of bruising, but that should resolve on its own within a few days. Are you comfortable proceeding with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. A little pinch, I can manage that. And a bit of bruising is no bother at all. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I just want to get this done and have peace of mind, you understand? Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I understand completely. Nurse Adebayo, could you please come in and assist us with the blood draw?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. It’s good to know there are people like you looking after us.
DOCTOR: Nurse Adebayo: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Dr. Abady has explained the procedure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, good morning. Yes, the Doctor was very thorough in explaining everything. Thank you. I believe I’m ready when you are. Though, I must confess, I do tend to flinch. Please don’t mind if I close my eyes!
DOCTOR: Nurse Adebayo: No worries at all, Ms. Shaub. That’s perfectly fine. We’re very used to it. Just relax your arm, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and painless as possible. Nurse Adebayo: Okay, just a small pinch now… Nurse Adebayo: All done! See?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn’t too bad, actually. Thank you, Nurse. You were very gentle. Now what? Do I need to do anything special? And… how long before I can move my arm freely?
DOCTOR: Nurse Adebayo: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. You were very brave! It’s all over now. You don't need to do anything special. Just keep the bandage on for about fifteen to twenty minutes to prevent any bleeding. After that, you can remove it. You can move your arm freely right away, but avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the rest of the day. Dr. Abady will review the results as soon as they come back, which should be in about three to five business days. He will then contact you directly to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Three to five business days… alright. That’s manageable. No, I think that covers everything. You’ve both been very kind and reassuring. Honestly, I was more anxious about it than it actually was. Thank you both again. Is there anything I need to pay or sign before I leave?
DOCTOR: Nurse Adebayo: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. We’re glad we could help ease your anxiety. Nurse Adebayo: All done here, Doctor. Dr. Abady: Excellent. As you are uninsured, Ms. Shaub, the cost for the blood draw is $75, payable at the front desk. We also have a form confirming consent for the test, which I will need you to sign before you leave. Dr. Abady: Please take your time reviewing it, and let me know if you have any questions. We are happy to clarify anything before you sign. Dr. Abady: And again, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions while you wait for the results.
PATIENT: Right, $75. That’s quite alright. Hmm… “Potential risks include…” Oh dear. Well, a little bruising, I suppose. Everything seems in order, though. Here you are, Doctor. Thank you very much for everything. I feel much better now, honestly. And I’ll certainly pay at the front desk before I leave.
DOCTOR: Dr. Abady: Excellent. Thank you, Ms. Shaub. Dr. Abady: We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any unusual symptoms, such as fever, rash, or fatigue, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Dr. Abady: And thank you again for coming in today. We appreciate you trusting us with your health. Dr. Abady: Have a good day, Ms. Shaub.
