DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that's all. Don't really have time for a lot of questions, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical. We can certainly do that. It will involve some questions, unfortunately, just to make sure everything is as it should be and to be thorough for the insurance company. It shouldn't take too long. To start, can you tell me a little bit about any current health concerns you have?
PATIENT: Well… not really concerns, exactly. My knees bother me sometimes, getting up and down. Old sports injury. And I get tired easier than I used to, but I'm almost fifty, right? That's just getting older, I figure. Nothing the doctor's ever needed to look at before. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and fatigue. That's helpful. Just to clarify, when you say your knees bother you, is that a constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been on my feet a lot. Working at the lodging, you know? Lots of walking around. And sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a while too, kinda stiff. It's just… a pain. Not a bad pain, usually. More annoying than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's related to activity level—both with being on your feet and after periods of sitting. And you'd describe it as more of an annoyance than debilitating?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Debilitating… no. I can still do everything I need to. Just gotta, you know, move a little slower sometimes. Look, are we getting close to being done here? I got folks waiting at the lodging.
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Putney. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. It will help me complete the paperwork for the insurance company. You mentioned fatigue. Has that been a recent change, or has it been something you’ve noticed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It's hard to say exactly when it started. Just… over the last year or so, maybe? I used to be able to go all day without thinking about it. Now I need a little rest in the afternoon sometimes. Nothing major. Just… tired. Is that enough detail?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue, like shortness of breath, dizziness, changes in your weight, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just… tired. Weight's been pretty steady, maybe a few pounds here and there. No dizziness, no trouble breathing, no chest pain. Honestly, Doc, I think I’m just getting old. They just want to be sure, right? Insurance companies.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney. And you're right, insurance companies do need to be thorough. To be absolutely sure, I'd like to do a brief physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get it over with. The quicker we do this, the quicker I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat there, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning on its own. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. And now your knees. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: A little. Just a bit of stiffness. It's not sharp or anything. Like I said, it's more annoying than anything. Feels kinda… creaky, I guess. Don't make me do anything too strenuous, alright? I need these to stand all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild crepitus with movement, and a slightly limited range of motion, but no significant swelling or redness. Your gait appears stable. Alright, Mr. Putney. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, everything seems generally stable. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on, and the knee pain is likely related to some mild osteoarthritis, common with age and activity level. We can discuss some strategies to manage that. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Nope. No allergies. Never had any trouble with anything like that. Just… tired and creaky, that’s about it. Can we just get this paperwork done? I really need to get back.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. And you’re currently taking no medications, correct?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I try to stay healthy, you know? Just… get tired easier now. Like I said. So, is this over? Do I need to sign something?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Putney, this is almost over. Here's the paperwork the insurance company requires. It summarizes what we discussed today, and my findings. It notes the slightly elevated blood pressure and the likely osteoarthritis in your knees. It also recommends regular monitoring of your blood pressure and some simple exercises for your knees. If you could just sign here, and here to acknowledge you've received a copy, we'll be all set. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in about six months to recheck your blood pressure and see how the knee pain is progressing. Would you like me to have the receptionist schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. There. Done. No, I don't need a follow-up. I'll be fine. Just… tired. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Thank you for coming in. Here's a copy of the paperwork for your records. If you do experience any worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant changes in your fatigue level, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention.
