DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare, and we're located in a rural setting… quite alright. Now, please, tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Look, it’s… well, my wife insisted. She’s a bit of a worrier, you see. I wanted to get tested for… you know… the HIV thing. Just to put her mind at ease, really. I don't think I need it, but she’s been on my case.
DOCTOR: I see. While it's commendable your wife is proactive about your health, it's always prudent to address any concerns, regardless of personal belief. It's good you're coming in. To properly assess your risk and proceed with testing, I’ll need to ask a few questions, if you don’t mind. It’s important to be completely honest with me, as this is a confidential medical setting. First, have you ever had any sexual contact with anyone?
PATIENT: Honestly? Is that really necessary? It feels a bit… personal, doesn't it? Look, I’m married. A long time married. What does that even have to do with anything? I just want the test, you know? Is it going to take all day to get a simple blood draw? My wife is expecting me back soon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your discomfort. However, these questions are necessary. HIV transmission isn’t solely related to extramarital activity, though that is a risk factor. It’s transmitted through specific bodily fluids, and understanding your history allows me to assess your potential exposure accurately. It's part of responsible medical practice and ensures I’m providing the correct level of care. I assure you, this information is strictly confidential. To be clear, I’m not questioning your fidelity. I’m gathering information to determine the appropriate testing protocol and rule out other potential risks. It’s a routine part of the assessment. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason?
PATIENT: Look, this is ridiculous. Needles? Seriously? What do you think I am? I'm a compliance officer, not a… I don't even know what you're implying. I’ve never touched a needle in my life, apart from getting a flu shot. This is just… insulting, frankly. I came here to be polite and get this over with so my wife would stop nagging me, and now I'm being treated like… like I'm some kind of… risk? It’s just a test, right? Can’t we just do the test? I'm a healthy man. I eat well, I exercise… I don’t need a lecture on… well, whatever this is.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration, but I must reiterate that a thorough medical assessment is crucial. Your history, or lack thereof regarding certain behaviors, is relevant. Dismissing potential risks without proper inquiry is negligent. I am not here to judge, merely to gather information to ensure your health and well-being. Now, have you ever received a blood transfusion, or had any surgical procedures where you may have received blood products?
PATIENT: Transfusions? No. Surgery... let me think. Years ago, I had my wisdom teeth out. That's it. A very long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to ask me about every single thing I've ever done? This is getting… well, it's a bit much. I feel like I'm being interrogated. And frankly, I don't see what any of this has to do with simply checking for a virus. Just… please. Can we please just get to the test? I have things to do. My wife… she’s making dinner. A special dinner. And she’ll be very upset if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I will ask one final question, and I expect a straightforward answer. Have you ever had unprotected sexual contact with anyone, regardless of their marital status?
PATIENT: .
