DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t we start with what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hello Doctor. Yes, hello. Something about a…clearance? For…acting. They said I needed to come in for a check-up before I could…do that. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s…the performance thing, I think. I mostly just show tickets, you know? At the theatre.
DOCTOR: So, a medical clearance for acting – that’s perfectly alright. It's good you’re getting it checked out. And don't worry about the memory – that can happen with age, and as you said, with a busy schedule. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the acting?
PATIENT: Acting… Well, it's not…serious acting. More like…extra work. Background stuff. They needed people who…looked like people, I suppose. It’s a new production. A historical…drama? I think. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. They just said I needed to be cleared by a doctor. My ex-wife suggested I come here; said Doctor AX was…reliable.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Krahn. Extra work is still work, and it’s smart to get a check-up beforehand. It’s good your ex-wife recommended me. To help me understand what sort of physical demands this role might place on you, could you describe the kinds of things you'd be doing as an extra?
PATIENT: Oh dear…well, I think they said…standing. A lot of standing. And walking. Maybe some…pretend fighting? It was mostly just a casting call. They needed people who looked like merchants or townspeople. I wasn't really paying close attention. It’s been a while, and…well, things blend together, you know? Mostly just trying to look busy, I suppose. And not trip. I'm a bit clumsy these days.
DOCTOR: Standing, walking, possibly some light physical activity… okay. And you mentioned being a little clumsy?
PATIENT: Yes, well, it's not a fall-down clumsy, but…my balance isn't what it used to be. I sometimes feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Especially if I've been standing for a long time. And sometimes…a little dizzy. It’s probably just my age, though. Or not enough water. I try to drink enough water.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to have. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…that’s a difficult one. Let me see…my doctor, years ago, said something about my…blood pressure being a little high. But that was…a long time ago. And I think he put me on some pills. I stopped taking them after a while. They made me feel…tired. I don't think I have…diabetes, no. And my heart… feels alright. Sometimes it beats a little fast, but that’s probably just nerves. I don't really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, medication stopped due to fatigue, and no known diabetes. It's good you're letting me know this now. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think…I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And…oh, yes! I had a…a procedure on my knee. Years ago, after I tripped and fell. A minor thing, really. Just to…patch it up. Nothing serious. I think. It doesn't bother me much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy and a knee procedure. And you mentioned a slight discomfort in your knee still?
PATIENT: It's not pain, exactly. More like…a stiffness. Especially in the morning. Or after I've been standing for a while. It aches a little, but I can walk on it. I’ve just gotten used to it, I suppose. It doesn’t really stop me from doing anything… except maybe running. I haven't run in…decades.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiffness in the knee, especially with prolonged standing. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s another tricky one. My parents… they’re both gone now. And I didn’t really talk to them much about their…ailments. My mother, I think, had something with her…blood. But I don't remember the details. She was always a bit…private. My father… he smoked a lot. And he had… breathing problems later in life. But that’s about all I know. We weren’t a very close family, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history known. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, not at all. I used to smoke, a long time ago, when I was younger. But I quit… decades ago. And I don’t drink alcohol, no. Never really liked it. And certainly no…recreational drugs. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Theatre tickets, and a quiet evening at home. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I think I had a rash once, after taking some…pink pills. A long time ago. But I don't remember what they were for. And…bees! I’m allergic to bees. Not a serious allergy, thankfully, but I get a nasty sting. I try to avoid them as much as possible. Other than that…no, I don't think so. I eat most things. Except maybe shellfish. It doesn't agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a past reaction to pink pills and a mild allergy to bees, shellfish doesn't agree with you. Thank you, Mr. Krahn, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and assess your range of motion and balance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. I'm not very good with… doctors' things. But I suppose if it’s for the acting… yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148 over 85. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Now, can you stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A little…dizzy, perhaps. But I'm alright. Just give me a moment. Is that normal? Feeling a little unsteady?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to feel a little lightheaded when standing up quickly, especially with slightly elevated blood pressure. However, the wobble is something we should investigate further. Now, can you walk a few steps for me, heel to toe, like you're walking on a tightrope?
PATIENT: Heel to toe… oh dear. Oh! This is… difficult. I haven’t done this in years. I'm not very good at balancing, I told you. Perhaps I should just sit down.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's have you sit down. That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It's good we're assessing this. I notice some mild instability and a wider gait than expected. Now, let’s check your knee. Can you bend it for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable. It’s stiff. Not painful, exactly, but… restricted. I haven’t been doing much exercise, Doctor. It’s probably just…old age. It’s been like this for years, I told you. It’s not a serious problem, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I notice some stiffness and crepitus – a grinding sensation – in your knee. It’s good you're letting me know about this. Alright, Mr. Krahn, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, your slightly elevated blood pressure, mild instability when walking, and limited range of motion in your knee are concerning. While you haven't experienced any acute symptoms, these findings suggest potential issues that need further investigation. I want to order some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. I also recommend an X-ray of your knee to evaluate the joint structure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… an X-ray… oh dear. That sounds…serious. Are you saying something is really wrong? I just wanted to be cleared for the acting… I didn't want any trouble. Is it…is it something I should be worried about? I haven't felt sick, you understand. Just a little… unsteady sometimes. I don’t want to cause a fuss. Perhaps I should just forget about the acting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Krahn. It's good you're sharing this with me. It’s not necessarily something serious, but it’s important to investigate these findings to understand what’s causing your symptoms and prevent any potential problems down the road. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and allow us to make an informed decision about the best course of action. Right now, we're gathering information. The blood work will check things like your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The X-ray will help us see the structure of your knee joint and rule out any arthritis or other bone issues. I'm not suggesting you forget about the acting right away. But depending on the results of these tests, we may need to discuss modifying your activity level or seeking further treatment before you start. Would you like me to explain the process for getting the blood work and X-ray done?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, if you think it’s necessary. Blood work and an X-ray. Yes. Just…please don’t tell me anything too alarming, Doctor. I'm an old man. I don’t want to worry myself unnecessarily. And yes, please explain the process. I don't usually go to hospitals. I don't like them much. Is it going to be expensive? I'm not…insured, you see.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. I will explain everything clearly and we’ll take it one step at a time. And I will do my best to avoid alarming you. First, the blood work. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. We can give you a requisition form to take to the lab. There are a few labs nearby, and I can provide you with a list. The blood draw itself only takes a few minutes. The X-ray is also relatively quick and painless. You’ll simply stand or sit in front of the X-ray machine while the technician takes a picture of your knee. Again, I can provide you with a list of imaging centers nearby. Regarding the cost, I understand you’re not insured. The cost of the blood work can range from $100-$200, and the X-ray could be around $150-$300. I can provide you with estimates from the local labs and imaging centers. We can also discuss options for payment plans or financial assistance programs if needed. I will also give you a referral to a specialist if necessary. Before we proceed, do you have any questions about this process?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… complicated. Fasting… labs… specialists… $300? It’s a lot of money, Doctor. I wasn’t expecting this. And what if…what if they find something serious? Will I need… surgery? Or… medication? I don't like taking pills, you see. Maybe… maybe I should just forget about the acting after all. It’s probably not worth all this trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. It is a lot to take in, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let's take a deep breath. It’s important to remember that we don't know what the tests will show yet. Most likely, they’ll reveal a minor issue that we can address with simple treatments – things like physical therapy, stretching exercises, or over-the-counter pain relievers. If the tests do reveal something more serious, we’ll discuss all your options carefully and make a decision together. You are in control of your healthcare, and I will never recommend any treatment that you are not comfortable with. Regarding surgery and medication, those are only options if other treatments are not effective. We’ll explore all the conservative options first. And if medication is necessary, we can discuss alternatives and find something that you are comfortable with. Before we proceed with the tests, I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. You can ask me any questions you have, and I will do my best to answer them honestly and clearly. If you're not comfortable proceeding with the tests right now, that's perfectly alright. We can discuss alternative options or simply monitor your symptoms. The most important thing is that you feel safe and comfortable. Would you like me to give you some time to think about it?
PATIENT: Oh dear… This is all so much. Alright… alright, if you insist. I suppose… I suppose I should get the tests done. Just to put my mind at ease. But… but please, promise me you won’t tell me anything too alarming. And promise me you’ll explain everything clearly, in plain English. I don't understand all those medical terms. And…and could you write everything down for me? Just so I don’t forget. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. And…and could you help me schedule the appointments? I don’t know where to start.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I promise you, I will explain everything clearly, in plain English. I will also write everything down for you, and I will help you schedule the appointments. You don’t have to worry about a thing. First, we'll get you a requisition form for the blood work. The lab will need a 12-hour fast. I’ll write that down for you: “12-hour fast before blood work.” Then, we’ll get you a referral for an X-ray of your left knee. I’ll write that down as well: “X-ray of left knee.” Here are the phone numbers for a few labs and imaging centers nearby. I'll also write down a note: "Call for pricing and appointment scheduling." I can also call these places for you and schedule the appointments if you prefer. Do you have any questions about this process right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s very helpful. Yes, just one question. How long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. And what if… what if they find something bad? Will you call me right away? I don’t want to be left wondering.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Krahn. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the blood work results, and the X-ray results are typically available within the same day. “Blood work results: 2-3 business days. X-ray results: Same day.” I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and contact you immediately to discuss them. If anything concerning is found, I will call you right away, even if it’s after hours. You won't be left wondering. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results in detail and create a plan of action. Here’s my direct phone number: [Doctor AX’s Phone Number]. Please don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns before then. Now, would you like me to help you schedule those appointments, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, please, Doctor. Please schedule the appointments for me. I'm not very good with phones. And I'm afraid I'll forget something important. Just… just make sure they're not too early in the morning. And if possible, could they be on the same day? I don’t want to have to keep coming back. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I'm happy to help. Okay, I’ve scheduled your blood work for Wednesday at 10:00 AM at [Lab Name]. And I’ve scheduled your X-ray for Wednesday at 1:00 PM at [Imaging Center Name]. Both appointments are conveniently located near the clinic. Here are the appointment details. You’ll need to bring your insurance card – although you mentioned you’re not insured, it’s good to have just in case – and a valid photo ID. Do you have any questions about the appointments?
PATIENT: Wednesday at 10:00 AM for blood work, and 1:00 PM for the X-ray. No, I think that's all right. That should be manageable. Thank you again, Doctor. You've really taken a load off my mind. I'll try not to worry too much. I suppose that's all for today, then? I should be going. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns before Wednesday, please don't hesitate to call. You have a good day too, Mr. Krahn. And try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this.
