DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Nani. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. Feeling…low, you know? It’s been a bit unsettling, and my daughter insisted I come see someone. She worries. I suppose I do too, a little. I just… don’t have the energy for things anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. It’s good of you to come in, and it’s very common for people to experience periods of low energy and mood changes. Your daughter sounds very caring. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started and what specifically you mean by “not yourself”?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That’s a good question. It feels like it’s been creeping up on me for… oh, maybe six months now? It’s not like a sudden thing. Just… less enjoyment in things. Used to love my garden, always had visitors. Now… I just look at it. Don't feel much when I do. And I get tired easily. Even simple things, like going to the shops… it’s exhausting. And I sleep a lot, but don’t feel rested, you understand? It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do understand, Nani. A gradual onset over six months, less enjoyment in previously pleasurable activities, fatigue with even simple tasks, and feeling unrefreshed despite adequate sleep. That gives me some helpful information. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you might be experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t crave much, and often skip meals. I've lost a little weight, I think, but haven't really bothered to check. Oh, and I’ve been… forgetful. Not terribly, you understand. Just… little things. Where I put my keys, what I was saying mid-sentence. Nothing alarming. It’s just… adds to the general feeling of being… off. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Nani, thank you. Decreased appetite, some weight loss, and increasing forgetfulness. We're building a clearer picture. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. The doctor checks it regularly. Aside from that… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? A bit of arthritis in my knees. Nothing that requires ongoing treatment, really. And I had the flu a couple of times, of course. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I don’t believe I've ever been in hospital, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Well-controlled hypertension and some arthritis. That’s helpful. And no prior hospitalizations. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes, actually. Years ago, when I was still living in Nigeria, I had my appendix removed. It was quite a simple operation, really. And… oh, I had a cataract removed from my right eye about ten years ago. That was here, in this country. Both went well, no complications. Aside from those two, I haven't had any surgeries, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and cataract surgery. Thank you for letting me know. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother lived to a good age, but she had… what do you call it? The shaking sickness. Parkinson’s, that’s it. My brother has it now, too. It's not very common on my father's side, as far as I know. He died young, unfortunately. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, suffered from depression, years ago. Spent some time in a clinic. It’s… not something we talked about much. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's very relevant, Nani. A family history of Parkinson’s disease and depression is important information. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Could you tell me a little about your social situation?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not as full as it used to be. I live alone, since the divorce. My daughter, Bola, lives nearby, thankfully. She visits often, and calls every day. She’s very good. I have a few friends, but… we don’t see each other as much these days. Everyone’s getting older, you know? And… I'm not much for going out anymore. Prefer to stay at home, these days. Gardening keeps me occupied, when I have the energy. It's... quiet.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a close relationship with your daughter, which is wonderful, and that's good to have. And it’s perfectly understandable to prefer a quieter life. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Tried it once, years ago, didn’t care for it. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with a special meal, but that's about it. It doesn’t agree with me. Never really enjoyed it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Nani. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, amlodipine, I think it's called. And sometimes, if my arthritis is really bothering me, I'll take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, amlodipine for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Thank you for that complete list. Now, Nani, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. We'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. It will only take a few minutes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not significantly so. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which can be normal for your age, but we will keep an eye on that. Coordination seems intact. I am also noting some mild slowness in your movements. Do you notice this yourself?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. I suppose I have been feeling a bit… sluggish lately. It’s not dramatic, you understand. Just… takes me a little longer to get going in the mornings. And I stumble sometimes, though I usually blame it on the rug. It's not a new thing, just… more noticeable, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. That’s very helpful information. Given your symptoms – low energy, loss of enjoyment, fatigue, forgetfulness, mild slowness of movement, and family history – I would like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I'll also order a basic metabolic panel. And I'd like to discuss a possible referral to a neurologist. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help, then please do. Blood tests and a neurologist… I trust your judgment. I just want to feel like myself again. Honestly, it’s… tiring, being this way. I haven’t been a bother, have I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Nani. You haven't been a bother in the slightest. It's my job to listen and help you feel better, and you're doing exactly the right thing by coming in to see me. The lab will call you to schedule the blood work, and I'll have my assistant send you a referral form for the neurologist. They will also contact you to schedule an appointment. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing to engage in activities you enjoy as much as you can, even if you don't feel like it. And it’s very important to lean on your support system, such as your daughter, Bola. Are you currently taking any supplements at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no supplements. I’ve always been a bit wary of those. Prefer to get my vitamins from my food, when I can manage to eat it, that is. And you’re right about Bola. She’s a blessing, that girl. Always looking after me. I’ll try to do as you say, though it's easier said than done sometimes, when you're feeling… empty. Is there anything else I should be doing, whilst we wait?
DOCTOR: No, not at this time, Nani. Let's focus on getting the lab results back and seeing what the neurologist thinks. However, I do want you to be aware of some symptoms that would warrant a call to the office immediately. These include any sudden changes in vision, speech difficulties, weakness on one side of your body, or severe headache. I'm going to give you a printed sheet outlining those "red flag" symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness. It’s… a relief to be talking about it, honestly. I've been bottling it up for too long, I suspect. I suppose… I just hope we can figure out what’s wrong. Thank you, Doctor Shely.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. It was my pleasure. Remember, we'll work through this together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, take care of yourself. It was lovely meeting you. Have a good day, and I’ll see you after the lab results are available.
PATIENT: .
