DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's about my eyes, really. They've been really bothered by the sun lately. Much more than they used to be. It's like…everything's brighter, and it hurts to be outside for too long. It started a few weeks back, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbin. So, your eyes have been more sensitive to the sun over the past few weeks. You're experiencing discomfort when exposed to bright light. Can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… it's not really pain, exactly. More like…a really strong burning feeling. And it makes my eyes water a lot. Everything looks kinda washed out when it's really bad, too. Like when you've been staring at a bright light for a while. Does that make sense? I also get headaches sometimes, but I'm not sure if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Burning, watering, and a washed-out appearance with bright light exposure. And you’ve noticed headaches as well. Just to clarify, have you had any changes in your vision – like blurry vision, spots, or floaters – along with this sensitivity?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision itself feels fine, I think. Everything's still clear. No blurry spots or…those floaters you mentioned. Just the brightness bothering me, and the watering. And those headaches, when they come. I did have my eyes checked maybe…five years ago? Everything was normal then, I think. Regular check-up, nothing special.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes to your vision itself, and a normal eye exam about five years ago. That’s good information. I'd like to do a quick examination of your eyes, if you don't mind. I'll check your visual acuity, and then take a look at your eyes with an ophthalmoscope and check your pupils. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Sieh. I'm happy to do whatever tests you need. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my eyes, you know? I'm a little worried, to be honest. Being outside is…well, it’s important to me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good to get these things checked out. Okay, Arbin, can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Let me…okay, um…that’s…E, F, P, Z, and…is that a V? Yes, definitely a V. I think that’s the smallest line, right? It’s a little blurry, actually, now that you mention it. Not terribly, but not as sharp as it usually is. Maybe I need new glasses? I haven't thought about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your visual acuity is slightly reduced – not significantly, but enough to notice. We'll need to document that. Now, I’m just going to shine a light in your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it might be a little bright. Look straight ahead. Alright. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, and the back of your eyes appears normal. There’s no obvious inflammation or damage. However, I do see some mild corneal staining. It's subtle, but it’s there. It suggests you may have some surface irritation of your corneas.
PATIENT: Corneas? Is that…serious? What causes that? I haven't been doing anything different, really. Just…trying to enjoy the summer. I do wear contacts sometimes, but I’ve been mostly using my glasses lately. Could that be it? I always wash my hands before touching them, but… you know, you never know.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break that down. Your corneas are the clear front part of your eyes – like the windshield on a car. Corneal staining indicates some damage to that surface. It’s not necessarily serious in and of itself, but it can be very uncomfortable, and if left untreated, it could lead to infection. The most likely cause, given your symptoms and your contact lens use, is likely photokeratitis – essentially a sunburn of the cornea. Even with sunglasses, prolonged sun exposure can cause this. Contact lenses can sometimes exacerbate it. While it can happen without contacts, they can increase your risk. Do you recall being in any particularly bright environments recently?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, that makes sense. A sunburn of the eye. That explains why it’s worse when I’m outside. And yeah, actually… last weekend I was at the beach. It was really sunny, and I was out for most of the day. I was wearing sunglasses, but maybe they weren't dark enough? Or maybe I just wasn’t careful enough about keeping them on? I definitely remember squinting a lot. And the water was sparkling… reflecting the sun, I guess. That makes a lot of sense now. I didn’t even think of my eyes getting sunburned.
DOCTOR: That sounds very likely. Being at the beach with bright sunlight and water reflections fits the picture perfectly. Alright, Arbin, I’m going to diagnose you with photokeratitis. Fortunately, it's usually self-limiting, meaning it will get better on its own. However, we want to make it more comfortable and prevent complications. I recommend the following: 1. Artificial tears: Use these frequently – every 1-2 hours while you're awake – to keep your eyes lubricated. 2. Avoid sun exposure: Wear sunglasses with 100% UVA and UVB protection whenever you're outdoors, even on cloudy days. A wide-brimmed hat can also help. 3. Rest your eyes: Avoid contact lens wear until your symptoms completely resolve. 4. Cool compresses: Apply cool, moist compresses to your eyes for 10-15 minutes several times a day. I’m going to prescribe you a bottle of artificial tears. I’ll also give you a written summary of these instructions. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds really reasonable. Artificial tears, good sunglasses, rest… I can definitely do that. 100% UVA and UVB, I’ll make sure to check that on the label when I get new ones. And I’ll lay off the contacts for a while, no problem. Um… how long will it take to get better? And is there anything I should be worried about? Like…when should I come back if it doesn't improve? I just don't want it to get worse. And thank you, Dr. Sieh. This is a big relief to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad we were able to figure it out. Typically, photokeratitis resolves within 24-72 hours. However, it can sometimes take a little longer, especially if it was a more severe exposure. Here's what to watch for: Increased pain: If the pain gets significantly worse, despite using artificial tears and avoiding sun exposure. Vision changes: Any blurry vision, double vision, or decreased vision. Excessive redness or discharge: If your eyes become very red, or if you notice any pus-like discharge. Sensitivity to light: if it becomes unbearable. If you experience any of those symptoms, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest urgent care or emergency room. I want to see you back in one week to check your progress, just to make sure everything is healing as it should. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. One week is fine. I'll definitely watch out for those symptoms, and I'll come back if anything changes. And I'll remember to get better sunglasses! Thank you so much, Dr. Sieh. You’ve been really helpful. I feel a lot better knowing what to do. I think I can handle this now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and protect those eyes! Have a good day.
