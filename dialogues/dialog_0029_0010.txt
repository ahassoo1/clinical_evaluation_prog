DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s mostly… around here, I think. <points vaguely to neck> It came on rather gradually, and honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so pinpointing when exactly is proving troublesome. It’s not particularly painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Gradual swelling around the neck. Not painful, just noticeable. And you’re having some trouble recalling exactly when it started. That's alright, we’ll figure it out. Let's start with a little more detail. Can you describe the swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm… it feels… soft, I suppose? Not hard or firm. And it seems to be… bigger in the mornings, perhaps? Though, again, it’s hard to be certain. It’s not… a sudden puffiness, more like… a consistent fullness. I haven’t noticed any redness or warmth, if that helps. Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be more precise, but the details… they’re a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, soft swelling, bigger in the mornings, no redness or warmth. Consistent fullness, not a sudden puffiness. I appreciate you trying to be as specific as possible. It is helpful. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your voice?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. <pauses, thinking> I hadn’t consciously noticed difficulty swallowing, no. And my voice… I suppose not, although my sister did comment recently that I sounded a little… congested? It was a passing remark, and I didn’t pay much attention to it at the time. It could have been just a cold, really. I do tend to get those. Would you like me to try and speak a little louder, perhaps? To see if you notice anything?
DOCTOR: No, no need to force it. Your sister mentioning congestion is good to know, though. Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. Chills… perhaps a mild one a few weeks back, but I assumed it was just the air conditioning. Night sweats… I haven’t paid particular attention, to be honest. And weight loss… that’s possible, actually. My clothes have felt a little looser lately, but I hadn’t connected it to anything specific. I’ve not been intentionally trying to lose weight. It’s just… happened gradually. It’s quite frustrating, not being able to recall details easily. Is that common, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Okay, so mild chills a few weeks ago, and unintentional weight loss. We'll definitely explore that further. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. I don’t believe so, no. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized or had any major surgeries. I do have some… sensitivities, perhaps? I sometimes get a bit of heartburn, and I’m mildly allergic to dust, but that’s about it. Is there anything specific you're looking for, Doctor? My records might be… incomplete. It's been a while since I've had a thorough check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just childhood illnesses, occasional heartburn, and a mild dust allergy. Good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother passed away several years ago, and I wasn’t very close to my father’s side of the family. As far as I know, there weren’t any major health concerns on my mother’s side – perhaps some high blood pressure in her older brother, but nothing definitive. My father… I believe he had some arthritis in his knees, but again, I’m not entirely sure. It’s difficult to recall specific details, Doctor, and I apologize for my vagueness. Is there a particular condition you’re interested in? Perhaps if you mentioned it, it might jog my memory.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary. It’s perfectly alright. We'll work with what you can remember. Okay. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not taking any medications at all. I try to avoid them if possible. I occasionally take an antacid for heartburn, but that’s very infrequent. And no supplements, vitamins, or anything of that nature. I prefer to… address things naturally, if I can. I believe in a healthy diet and getting enough rest. <smiles faintly> Though, perhaps I haven’t been doing enough of that lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or supplements. Okay, Jahaad. With your permission, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your neck to assess the swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgment, and I appreciate you taking the time to examine me thoroughly. I hope it won’t take too long; I have a… a commitment later this afternoon, but it’s not urgent. <shifts slightly in chair> Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up straight on the examination table, please. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's feel your neck. I do feel some mild swelling in the anterior cervical region, as you described. It’s soft and doesn't appear to be particularly tender. There are no immediately concerning nodules or masses. It seems to be more prominent on the left side. Approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain, exactly. It’s… more of a pressure, I suppose. A slight… fullness. It’s not unpleasant, but I can definitely feel it when you touch it. It’s… strange. I hadn’t realized how noticeable it was until you pointed it out. It feels… a bit like a muscle ache, perhaps? Though I haven’t been exercising particularly strenuously lately. <rubs neck gently> I suppose that’s not very helpful. Is that normal? Should I be concerned?
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure and fullness, rather than pain. That’s helpful information. It doesn't sound like anything immediately alarming, but given the gradual onset and the swelling, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. And I’d also like to order a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to evaluate your thyroid function. Occasionally, thyroid issues can cause neck swelling. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolyte balance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. A CBC, a TSH test… and a metabolic panel, you said? I trust your judgment entirely. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Fasting, perhaps? Or any specific precautions? I just want to ensure I do everything correctly. <looks at Doctor expectantly> And… how long will it take to get the results? I have that commitment this afternoon, and I was hoping to have some idea of… well, anything significant before then. Though I understand that may not be possible.
DOCTOR: Good questions. For the basic metabolic panel, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. The CBC and TSH don't require fasting. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. Unfortunately, that means you likely won’t have them before your commitment this afternoon. However, the lab will expedite the results if possible. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment for early next week to discuss them as soon as they are available. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Fasting for 8-12 hours, no problem. And a follow-up appointment next week is fine. I appreciate you expediting the results, and I understand that these things take time. <smiles faintly> I suppose I’ll just have to… be patient. <pauses> And is there anything I should be looking out for in the meantime? Any specific symptoms that would warrant a call? Or should I simply wait for the results? I apologize for asking so many questions; I’m just… a bit anxious, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's good to be informed. While we wait for the results, please contact us immediately if you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, significant pain in your neck, or any fever. If the swelling increases rapidly, that’s also a reason to call. Otherwise, you can simply wait for the results. Try not to worry too much. We’re taking all the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis. Here is the order for the blood tests. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics location. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you for your patience and thoroughness. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I’ll go to Quest Diagnostics as soon as possible and get the tests done. And I’ll be sure to contact you if I experience any of the symptoms you mentioned. Thank you again for your time, Doctor Chora. I feel… slightly more reassured now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week. .
