DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. Eaddy. I see you’re here today. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… rather embarrassing, to be quite frank. But I’ve noticed something… unpleasant and I thought it best to get it looked at. It’s about… a discharge. A gentleman-related discharge, if you catch my meaning. It’s not my discharge, naturally.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. Not… originating from yourself. I see. And how long has this… situation been occurring, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think. It’s been… perhaps a week now. Maybe a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. It wasn't constant at first, just… a little something after… well, after intimacy. But now it seems to be happening more frequently, and it’s… rather unsightly. Honestly, it’s quite concerning. One expects a certain level of… discretion, doesn't one?
DOCTOR: Discretion is… paramount, certainly. And you mentioned this occurs after intimacy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. After… relations. With a… companion. A perfectly respectable companion, I assure you. It's just… this shouldn't be happening. One reads about these things, of course, but one doesn't expect it to happen to one. And frankly, it’s disrupting my… schedule. I have commitments, you understand. Social commitments.
DOCTOR: I understand. And would you describe this discharge – in terms of color, consistency, and odor – if you're able?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must we? It's… yellowish, I suppose. Not a bright yellow, mind you, more of a… faded, sickly hue. And… a bit watery. Not thick, thankfully. As for the odor… well, it's not pleasant. It’s… fishy. Yes, that’s the word. Rather fishy. It's terribly embarrassing to admit, but it’s the truth. I certainly don’t smell of fish normally, I assure you. It’s quite… unbecoming.
DOCTOR: Fishy, you say. And watery. Has your companion experienced any… similar symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, honestly! You ask the most… forward questions. No, he has not! He's perfectly healthy, I assure you. A very… vigorous gentleman. It must be something I’ve contracted. One can’t be too careful, you know. One meets all sorts of people. Although, naturally, he’s… discreet. Very discreet. It’s simply… baffling. And terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate your… thoroughness, Ms. Wartick, we must proceed with a clinical assessment. I will need to perform a pelvic exam. This will allow me to better ascertain the nature of the issue. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: A… pelvic exam? Oh, dear. That sounds… rather intrusive. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? Couldn't we perhaps… try something else first? I mean, if it's simply a minor irritation, surely a cream or something would suffice. I'm not terribly fond of examinations, you understand. It's a bit… undignified. And I have a luncheon appointment afterwards. A very important luncheon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, a diagnosis cannot be made without a proper examination. A cream would be… speculative, at best. We need to determine the cause of this discharge before we can consider any treatment. It is, quite frankly, irresponsible to proceed otherwise. The examination is necessary. It will be brief, and I assure you, conducted with the utmost professionalism. Now, if you would please…
PATIENT: Very well. But I expect absolute discretion, Doctor. And I do hope it won't take long. My schedule is rather demanding, you understand. And please, try not to… poke around too much. It’s quite… unsettling. I simply want this resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible. And if it is something… unpleasant, I expect a referral to a specialist immediately. I won’t tolerate any… amateurish handling of this situation.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Wartick. Discretion is assured. Please lie back on the examination table, and we will proceed. I will require you to remove your undergarments from the waist down. I will leave the room to allow you privacy. Please let me know when you are ready. You may wish to use the gown for modesty.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. A gown? As if that will provide any real… coverage. Very well. But I shall expect complete silence and the utmost efficiency, Doctor. And please, do be gentle. I haven't… been examined in quite some time. Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Quite ready. Though not pleased about it, I assure you. Get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better. And please, be quick. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will now perform a visual examination, followed by a speculum examination to collect a sample. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief. Please relax as much as possible. The cervix appears mildly inflamed, and there is a yellowish discharge present. I will now collect a sample for laboratory analysis to determine the cause of the inflammation. That concludes the examination. Please dress, and we will discuss the preliminary findings and next steps.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That is rather uncomfortable. Honestly, Doctor, couldn't you be more gentle? It feels… invasive. Is it over now? Finally. Well? What did you find? And what does it all mean? Is it something… serious? I simply must know. My companion will be most displeased if I've contracted anything… untoward.
DOCTOR: The examination revealed some cervical inflammation and a discharge, as we observed. Based on the visual findings, several possibilities exist. It could be a common bacterial infection, such as bacterial vaginosis, or a sexually transmitted infection. However, we cannot determine the exact cause without the laboratory results. I have sent the sample for testing, and the results should be available in approximately three to five business days. Until then, I recommend avoiding sexual intercourse. We will proceed based on the lab results. If it is a bacterial infection, a course of antibiotics will likely be prescribed. If it is a sexually transmitted infection, further testing and treatment will be necessary, as well as notification of your companion.
PATIENT: A sexually transmitted infection?! Oh, goodness, no! That’s… unthinkable! My companion would be utterly devastated. And my reputation… ruined! Are you certain it could be that? Perhaps it’s just… a minor irritation. A temporary imbalance. Surely antibiotics would suffice? And you expect me to… notify my companion? Absolutely not! That’s preposterous! I simply cannot do that. It’s a matter of… discretion, you understand. A gentleman doesn't need to know everything. What are the chances it isn't something… serious? Be honest with me, Doctor. And please, reassure me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your concerns. However, I must be frank. The presence of cervical inflammation and a discharge is indicative of an infection, and a sexually transmitted infection is a possibility. I cannot definitively rule it out without the laboratory results. As for the likelihood, it is difficult to say without knowing your sexual history. However, based on the visual findings, I would estimate a roughly 50% chance it is a common bacterial infection and a 50% chance it is a sexually transmitted infection. These are only estimates, of course. Regarding notification of your companion, I strongly advise it. It is a matter of public health and ethical responsibility. However, I cannot force you to do so. It is your decision. I will, however, document your refusal in your medical record. In the meantime, I recommend abstaining from sexual activity until we have the results. We will discuss treatment options once the results are available. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Fifty percent?! That’s… appalling! Unacceptable! My life will be ruined. Utterly ruined! And you expect me to… sit here and wait? Wait for confirmation of my impending doom? No, I have no further questions. I simply… need to process this information. And perhaps… consult with a solicitor. Just in case. I believe that will be all for today, Doctor. I shall await your call with… trepidation. And please, do try to hurry. My schedule, as you know, is rather demanding.
