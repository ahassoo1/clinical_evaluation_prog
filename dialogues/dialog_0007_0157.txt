DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the receptionist said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. My husband keeps telling me I need to come in, but I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re here, even if you’re not feeling any symptoms right now. High blood pressure can be a bit of a silent condition, which is why it's important to get it checked, as your husband rightly pointed out. To start, can you tell me a little more about how you found out your blood pressure was high?
PATIENT: He bought one of those machines, for home use. A little while back. Kept making me take it. Seemed like a waste of time and money, frankly. It just…showed a high number sometimes. He worried too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, a home blood pressure monitor. That's helpful. Do you know what the numbers were, roughly, when it was high?
PATIENT: I honestly don’t pay attention to numbers. He'd yell them out, something like…one-forty over…ninety? Something like that. I just told him to stop bothering me with it. Numbers aren’t my thing. I deal with real things, like blueprints and surveys. Not…digits.
DOCTOR: I understand – numbers can be overwhelming. “140 over 90” is considered elevated, and consistently high readings like that do need to be addressed. Just to get a baseline, and because home readings can sometimes be a little off, I’d like to take your blood pressure here in the office. Then we can talk about what it means and what steps we might want to consider. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. This is taking up a whole afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see… Your blood pressure right now is 152 over 98. It’s a little high. I also want to check your pulse. Pulse is 82, which is normal. Do you have any other symptoms at all that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, I feel fine. Perfectly normal. A little annoyed, maybe, from all this fuss, but that’s it. This is ridiculous. People have real problems, you know? I’m wasting my time here for…what, exactly? A slightly high number?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tasmia. It is good that you’re not experiencing any symptoms right now. However, consistently high blood pressure, even without symptoms, can lead to serious health problems down the line – things like heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. That’s why it's important to address it now, before it becomes a bigger issue. To get a better picture of what’s going on, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history and lifestyle. Just routine things, okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But I'm warning you, I don't remember a lot of dates or details. And I don’t see what my lifestyle has to do with anything. I work hard, I don’t sit around all day. That’s all you need to know. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll go as quickly as possible, and it's okay if you don't remember specific dates. Just your best recollection is fine. First, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Never. I'm perfectly healthy. I’ve always been strong. My grandmother lived to be ninety-five, and she didn't take a single pill in her life. Good genes, I guess.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear about your grandmother! Good genetics are certainly a blessing. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree, but that’s it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Not a hospital stay, though. My mother patched me right up. She knew everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Now we’re going way back. Look, my family is…long-lived, mostly. Lots of people living into their eighties and nineties. I think my uncle had something with his heart, maybe? A long time ago. But honestly, I wasn’t paying attention. We didn’t talk about that stuff. It was…bad luck. You didn't mention it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright if you don't have specifics. So, generally, a family history of heart issues, potentially. Let's talk about your daily life a bit. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My husband smokes sometimes, but I make him go outside. I won’t have that filth in my house. It's bad for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Sometimes a glass of wine with dinner. Maybe two, if it's been a stressful week. That’s it. I don’t need a lot to relax. And I definitely don’t drink every night. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And finally, do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise? Look, I’m on my feet all day at work. That’s exercise enough. I don't have time to go to a gym or anything. I'm a civil engineering technician. I'm not sitting at a desk. I’m out in the field, running surveys, reading blueprints… It's physical work. Honestly, I’m probably in better shape than half the people who do go to the gym.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So you’re physically active at work, which is great. Now, just one last thing before we move on to a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never had any allergies in my life. I can eat whatever I want. I'm perfectly fine. It's another thing I don’t have to worry about. Now, can we get this over with? I have a site visit tomorrow, and I need to review the plans tonight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, that's all the questions for now. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Take a deep breath in… and out… Again… Good. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm also going to check your reflexes and feel your abdomen. Just routine. Everything feels normal there as well. Blood pressure is still elevated at 152/98. Given your blood pressure readings and your family history, I think it would be a good idea to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? Look, I really don’t like this. I feel perfectly fine. Are you sure this is necessary? My husband is the one who’s worried, and frankly, he worries about everything. I just want to go home. This is a waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Tasmia. It’s frustrating when you’re feeling well and being told you need tests. But these tests aren't about confirming a diagnosis right now. They're about gathering information to rule out potential causes for your elevated blood pressure and to assess your overall risk for future health problems. We’d start with a basic blood panel to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. We’d also do a urinalysis. Then, to get a more detailed picture of your heart health, I’d recommend an EKG – that's a simple, painless test that measures your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if everything comes back normal, I'm not coming back. I'm serious. I have a life to live, and I don't have time for unnecessary tests just because my husband is a hypochondriac. And make it quick. The longer I'm here, the more annoyed I get. And I'm already pretty annoyed.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get these tests done quickly and efficiently. And I'll make sure the results are sent to you as soon as they're available. Let me write the orders for the blood panel, urinalysis, and EKG. The nurse will explain how to schedule the EKG, and you can get the blood work done at the lab across the hall. In the meantime, I'd like to give you some information about high blood pressure, and some general lifestyle recommendations that can help lower your blood pressure, even before we get the test results. It's things like eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing stress. Would you like a pamphlet?
PATIENT: No. I don't need a pamphlet. I already know all that stuff. I eat perfectly fine, I work hard, and I manage my stress just fine. I don’t need someone telling me how to live my life. Just get me the orders so I can get out of here. This has been a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, here you go. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the instructions for scheduling the EKG. Please call the office if you have any questions or concerns, and we’ll be in touch as soon as your test results are back. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Tasmia?
PATIENT: No. That’s it. I’m done. Just let me go. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day, Tasmia, and please don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. .
