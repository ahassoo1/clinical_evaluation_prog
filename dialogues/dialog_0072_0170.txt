DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 49 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Forty-nine. Um, I need this exam for life insurance. They sent me over here. Just gotta get it done, really.
DOCTOR: I see. A life insurance physical. Well, we certainly can do that. It’s good you're being proactive. While insurance companies have their specific requirements, we will still perform a comprehensive exam to ensure a complete picture of your health. To start, could you tell me about any current medical problems you are experiencing?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, you know, just with work. I manage a small hotel, it keeps me busy. But nothing... serious. No big problems, I guess. I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Many people don't seek medical attention unless absolutely necessary. Let’s clarify "tired sometimes.” Is this fatigue interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Nah, not really interfering. Just… at the end of the day, I’m beat. Like, I just wanna sit and watch TV. I used to fish more, but... haven't had the energy lately. It's probably just the job, honestly. Long hours. I don't think it’s anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your assessment, Mr. Putney. However, even seemingly minor changes in energy levels can indicate underlying issues. To be thorough – and for the insurance company’s requirements, naturally – I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Um... well, sometimes my legs feel a little heavy. Like, after a long day on my feet. I thought it was just from standing so much. And maybe a little short of breath if I try to do too much. But like I said, it’s probably just being out of shape. I used to be pretty active, but… things change, you know?
DOCTOR: Heavy legs and shortness of breath… those are important details, Mr. Putney, despite your belief they may be benign. For documentation purposes, could you rate the shortness of breath on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being the most severe you can imagine?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A scale? Um... I guess… a three, maybe? Four on a really bad day, if I’m trying to walk up a hill or something. It doesn't happen all the time, just when I push myself. Honestly, I haven't really thought about it much until now. This whole thing is kinda making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Putney. It's good that we're discussing these details now. To get a more complete picture, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, actually. Had the flu a couple times, usual stuff. My mom had high blood pressure, I think, but I don’t. I get checked when I have to for work, and everything's always been okay. Mostly. This insurance thing is making me think too much about all this, I swear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. One time I broke my arm when I was a kid, had to go to the hospital for a cast. That was a long time ago. Other than that, nothing. I stay out of hospitals if I can. They're expensive, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Beyond your mother's high blood pressure, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Um… my dad, he… he died of a heart attack when he was pretty young. Maybe in his sixties. And my aunt on my wife's side had cancer, lung cancer, I think. But that's about it, really. We don’t really talk about it much. It's kinda sad. Everything feels so… heavy now, talking about all this. Is this gonna take much longer?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Putney. This is a standard assessment, and I assure you we are nearing completion of the initial questioning. Knowing your family history is crucial, especially given your father’s heart attack. Now, I need to ask about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. My wife, she smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. It was hard on both of us, honestly. But she's been good for a long time now. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat okay, mostly. Not a lot of fast food. This is just... a lot. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Putney. One final section of questions, and then we will proceed with the physical examination. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing crazy. I don't drink every day, and I definitely don’t get drunk. Just...relaxing. Is this important? It feels like you're looking for something wrong.
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Mr. Putney. It allows me to accurately assess your overall health. To be thorough, could you estimate how many alcoholic beverages you consume on a typical week?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Maybe... four or five beers a week? Sometimes less. Look, I'm being honest here. I'm not a big drinker, okay? I just want this done. This is all making me stressed out, and that can't be good for my heart, right? Can we please get to the exam now? I have a hotel to run.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the physical examination. I will need you to change into a gown. Please note that, given your reported fatigue, shortness of breath, family history of heart disease, and alcohol consumption, I will be ordering an EKG, a chest X-ray, and a comprehensive blood panel. These tests are necessary to ensure a thorough evaluation and determine if further investigation is needed. I understand your time is valuable, but your health is paramount. The nurse will show you to the examination room.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. An EKG… a chest X-ray… just what I needed. Let's just get this over with. Where's the nurse? .
