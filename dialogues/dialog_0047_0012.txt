DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's lovely to meet you. I'm here because I'm going on a cruise next month – the 18th, to be precise – and the cruise line needs a bit of medical information from a doctor. Just to say I'm fit to travel, really. Nothing complicated, I hope.
DOCTOR: A 'fit to travel' note, right. Well, even for a simple request, we need to gather some information. It wouldn’t do to have something overlooked, would it?
PATIENT: No, certainly not. That’s very sensible. I wouldn’t want that at all. I’m quite particular about being prepared, you see. What sort of information do you need? I do hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Squiers. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, my husband, God rest his soul, he had a touch of high blood pressure, but I never have. I had a bad bout of the flu a few winters ago, and a touch of bronchitis once, but nothing a good rest didn't cure. Oh, and I broke my wrist when I was a girl, climbing a tree, but that’s healed perfectly. No, I can’t think of anything…significant, as you say. I was always quite healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Right. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, not a one. I've always been lucky, or perhaps careful! I’ve never needed to go under the knife, thankfully. Just the usual… dentist, of course, but that hardly counts. I do try to look after myself, you know. A good diet and plenty of fresh air.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy. None at all! Not a single pill, cream, or anything. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes a little paracetamol for a headache, but that’s it, and those are very infrequent. I’m rather proud of that, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I eat almost anything, and I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I’ve been quite lucky in that regard too, I suppose. My husband had a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but I didn't inherit that, thankfully. It always worried him, going out to eat.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, now that’s a bit trickier. My father had a weak heart, I believe, though he lived to a good age, eighty-seven. And my mother… well, she had a touch of arthritis in her later years. My brother is very healthy, as far as I know, though we don't see each other often. He lives in Canada, you see. It’s a long journey to visit. Is that what you needed to know? I can try to recall more if you'd like.
DOCTOR: That’s sufficient for now. Let's move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness no! Never have, never will. It’s a dreadful habit. My husband smoked a pipe for a time, but he gave that up years ago, thankfully. It smelled terrible, and I always worried about his lungs. I prefer a nice cup of tea, myself. Much healthier, you see.
DOCTOR: And how much alcohol do you consume, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all, Doctor. Just a small glass of sherry with my Christmas dinner, and perhaps a wee sip of wine if I'm out with friends. Nothing regular, I assure you. I prefer a good cup of tea, as I said, or a bit of fruit juice. I don’t have a strong head for it, you see. A little goes a long way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you been experiencing any health problems currently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I feel quite well, all things considered. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. My knees ache a bit after a long walk, but nothing a warm bath doesn’t cure. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… nothing like that. I’m quite robust, actually. I’m very active, you see, always pottering about in the garden. It keeps me young!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and have a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Just routine, you understand. Could you sit up on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Anything you think is necessary. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a bit of gardening to finish this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… a little bit of a murmur, but not concerning in a woman of your age. Lungs clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Not alarming, but something to keep an eye on. Ears clear. Throat looks fine. Well, everything seems generally okay, but that blood pressure is a bit high. I’d like to discuss that with you.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? My blood pressure being high, I mean. I've always been a bit anxious, perhaps that’s it? Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I do try to stay calm, but sometimes… well, life throws things at you, doesn’t it? I do get a bit flustered easily, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious at this moment, Ms. Squiers, but elevated blood pressure is something we need to address. It can lead to more significant problems down the line if left unchecked. Your anxiety could certainly be a factor, but we shouldn’t rule out other possibilities. It’s often a combination of things. Have you had your blood pressure checked recently, perhaps at a pharmacy or by another doctor?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t, actually. I’ve never really bothered with it, if I’m honest. My husband always looked after those sorts of things. He used to say I worried too much about everything, and to just leave it to the professionals. I suppose I just…trusted him. It's been a few years since he passed, and I haven't really gotten around to establishing a new routine, you see. I rather avoided doctors, if I'm honest. They always seemed to have bad news.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll get a baseline reading today, and I’d like you to monitor it at home. I’ll write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. Take it twice a day, morning and evening, and keep a log of the readings. We’ll review them at a follow-up appointment in a month. And I’d like you to try to reduce your stress levels. Consider some relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, yoga, or even just taking a warm bath. Here’s the prescription for the monitor. And I'm going to recommend a referral to the local specialist, Dr. MacLeod, he has a very good reputation. He’ll be able to discuss this in more detail and if necessary, prescribe medication.
PATIENT: Oh, right. A monitor, and a specialist. That sounds… a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I’m not very good with machines, and I don’t really like taking pills. Is it absolutely necessary, though? I mean, I feel perfectly fine, all things considered. Perhaps it’s just a temporary blip? I do get a bit worked up when I think about the cruise, you know. Making sure everything is perfect, all the arrangements… it's a lot to take on by myself. Is Dr. MacLeod a very…serious doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, it’s always best to be proactive when it comes to your health. Ignoring elevated blood pressure is not a sensible option. The monitor will give us valuable information, and Dr. MacLeod is an excellent physician. He’s thorough, but pragmatic. He won’t rush into anything unnecessary. As for the cruise, well, stress can certainly contribute to temporary increases in blood pressure, but it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. And quite frankly, I am recommending this referral, Ms. Squiers. It is for your own well-being. I will write the referral now. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well, if you think it's best, Doctor. I suppose I should trust your judgement. You are the professional, after all. Will the referral take long to arrange? I don’t want to delay things unnecessarily. And…is Dr. MacLeod very expensive? I don’t have a great deal of money, you see. It’s just me now, and…well, never mind. It’s probably a silly question.
DOCTOR: The referral should be straightforward. I'll fax it over to his office immediately. As for cost…Dr. MacLeod does have a sliding scale for patients without insurance, so it's worth discussing that with his receptionist when you book the appointment. Now, about that ‘fit to travel’ note… given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I’m going to write a note stating that you are generally fit for travel, pending review by Dr. MacLeod and blood pressure management. That is, with the understanding that you will seek medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms during your cruise. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. Pending. That doesn't sound very reassuring, does it? But I suppose it's better than nothing. I do hope it doesn't cause any problems with the cruise line. They're very strict about these things, you know. I suppose I should book an appointment with Dr. MacLeod as soon as possible. Do you have his number, by any chance? And…what sort of symptoms should I be looking out for, exactly? I don't want to worry unnecessarily, but it's always best to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Dr. MacLeod’s number is on the referral form. He’s located just down the road, at the community health centre. As for symptoms… dizziness, severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision… anything unusual. But honestly, Ms. Squiers, try not to focus on the worst-case scenarios. The important thing is to get your blood pressure checked and managed. Now, do you have any other questions, or can we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And…for the note, and the referral. I do appreciate it, even if it’s a bit…worrying. I’ll book an appointment with Dr. MacLeod first thing tomorrow. I hope you have a pleasant day, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do take care, Ms. Squiers. And please, don’t hesitate to contact us if anything concerning arises. .
