DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Annesley, nice to meet you too. Just here for my shots, like the nurse said. Routine stuff, I guess. Keeping up with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear – proactive care is excellent. The nurse let me know you were interested in making sure your vaccinations are up-to-date. Just to confirm, are we talking about your tetanus, flu, pneumococcal, or something else specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, honestly? I don’t really keep track of all those names. I just know I want to be protected, you know? Especially with winter coming up. I think the flu shot is probably the most important one, but… whatever you recommend, really. I trust your judgement. Is there a list somewhere of what older folks should be getting?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. It can be a lot to keep track of! And that’s a very sensible approach. There is a recommended schedule, and it does change a bit with age and health conditions. Let me pull up the current CDC guidelines for adults over 50… Generally, we recommend an annual flu shot, a tetanus booster every 10 years, and pneumococcal vaccines – there are two main types, and depending on your age and health, you might need one or both. We also check for shingles vaccine, and sometimes COVID boosters are recommended. Do you recall ever having had a shingles shot?
PATIENT: Shingles… Oh, goodness. I think my husband, Earl, got one a few years back. He said it was pretty rough. I don't think I've had one myself, but… honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s possible the doctor back home did it and I just don’t remember. It was before we moved here, for sure. Earl handles most of the appointment scheduling now, so I usually just go along with whatever he sets up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure. We can certainly check our records to see if there’s any documentation of a shingles vaccine, though sometimes those records aren't complete. I don't see anything documented here about a shingles vaccine. Given your age and assuming no prior vaccination, it's likely you'd be a good candidate. It’s a very effective vaccine to prevent a potentially painful condition. Before we move on, do you have any allergies to vaccines or medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've had all my regular shots over the years, and never had a bad reaction. Earl always asks when he makes the appointments, and they've never said anything. I'm pretty healthy, all things considered. I do get a little achy in the mornings, but that's just old age, I suppose. Is there anything bad about the shingles shot? I read something online about side effects, but… well, you know how it is with the internet. Lots of opinions.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation and appreciate you asking. You are right to be cautious and do your research. The internet can certainly be overwhelming! The most common side effects of the shingles vaccine are mild – some soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue or headache. These usually resolve within a couple of days. More serious side effects are very rare. The benefits of preventing shingles, which can cause long-term nerve pain, far outweigh the risks in most cases. Now, let's talk about your flu shot. Are you planning on getting that today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That’s the main reason I came in, really. Earl’s always saying I get every bug that goes around, and he worries about me. If a shot can help keep me from getting sick this winter, I’m all for it. What kind of flu shot do you recommend? Is there more than one?
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful reason to get vaccinated, wanting to protect yourself and ease your husband’s worries. And yes, there are a few different types of flu vaccines available. We typically offer a standard dose flu shot, and a high-dose flu shot. The high-dose vaccine is specifically designed for people 65 and older. It creates a stronger immune response, offering better protection. Given your age, I would recommend the high-dose vaccine. Are you okay with getting that today?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds good! A high-dose one… better protection sounds perfect. Yes, let’s do that one. I appreciate you explaining things so clearly, Dr. Annesley. It makes me feel a lot better knowing I’m getting the best one for me. Do I need to roll up my sleeve or…?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes – that’s exactly what I’m here for. Excellent. Just roll up your left sleeve, please. And I'll clean the area with an alcohol swab before the injection. It's a quick pinch, and then you'll be all set. I’m going to ask you a few questions while I administer the vaccine, just to make sure everything is alright. Do you have any pain anywhere else today?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little bit of my usual morning stiffness. Nothing out of the ordinary. You go right ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all done. Just a little pressure for a few moments. You might feel some soreness at the site later today, but that should resolve within a day or two. Are you experiencing any immediate side effects, like dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Didn't even feel it, really. That was quick! You're a very good doctor, Dr. Annesley. I'm glad Earl found you. So, is that everything for today? Or is there anything else we should talk about?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Fornes! I’m glad it was a comfortable experience. As for other things, let's quickly review your medications and any recent health changes. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Earl handles a lot of that, too. I take a baby aspirin every day, the doctor said it was good for my heart. And I take a multivitamin, just a regular one. Oh, and sometimes I take Tylenol for my arthritis, when it's really acting up. That’s about it, I think. Nothing new. Earl keeps a list, I'm sure. I could ask him when we get home.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Aspirin, a multivitamin, and Tylenol as needed – that's good to know. It’s always best to have a complete list, and your husband keeping one is excellent. Now, do you have any concerns about your heart health or have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs or ankles recently?
PATIENT: No, no problems with my heart. The doctor gave me the aspirin, like I said, just to be safe. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, and my ankles aren’t swollen. I walk a little bit every day, if the weather’s nice. Keeps me moving. Earl worries about me sitting too much. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Staying active is so important, and it sounds like you have a very supportive husband! Okay, one last quick thing. Have you had a recent tetanus shot?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about things I really don't remember. I think… maybe? It was a long time ago. Probably back home, before we moved. Earl usually keeps track of those things, too. I’m terrible with dates and shots.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's alright. We can check the records again, though sometimes those aren't complete. It looks like your last tetanus booster was over ten years ago. It’s recommended to get a booster every ten years, so it’s time for one. Would you like to go ahead and get that today, or would you prefer to schedule another appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, if it’s been that long… better to get it done, I suppose. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. I don’t like having to come back for more shots if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're right; it's best to stay up to date. Okay, just roll up your other sleeve. It’s a similar pinch to the flu shot, and then you’ll be all set. I’ll ask you a few questions while I administer the vaccine. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet today?
PATIENT: No, everything feels fine. No numbness or tingling, just a little bit of morning stiffness, like usual. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all done. Just a little pressure for a few moments. You might feel some soreness at the site later today, but that should resolve within a day or two. Are you experiencing any immediate side effects, like dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even a pinch! You’re very gentle, Doctor. Well, I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I’m all poked and prodded for the year, hopefully. Thank you very much, Dr. Annesley. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fornes. I’m glad I could help. Yes, that’s everything for today. You’re up to date on your vaccinations. I’ll print out a summary of what we discussed and your vaccination record for you to keep. Here’s some information on what to expect after your vaccinations, and a phone number to call if you experience any unusual side effects. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything so clearly, and I feel much better now. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll be sure to tell Earl how good you were. He’ll be relieved to know I’m all taken care of. Have a good day, Dr. Annesley.
DOCTOR: You're very kind, Ms. Fornes. And please give my regards to Earl. It was a pleasure meeting you. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: . Thank you again, Doctor.
