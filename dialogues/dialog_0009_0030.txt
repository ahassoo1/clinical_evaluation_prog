DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. I see here you’re with Medicare, and we’re in the suburban clinic today. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Yes, Medicare is correct. Um, well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my… body odor. It’s just different than it usually is, and it’s been bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body; that’s what I’m here for. Many things can cause a change in body odor, and we'll work together to figure out what might be going on with you. Can you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay, good. It’s just… I usually don’t smell at all, really. I mean, normal human smell, you know? But lately, it’s… stronger. And not a bad smell, exactly, just… different. Kind of musky, maybe? It's hard to describe. And it seems to be all over, not just under my arms. It’s been going on for maybe a month or so, I’d say. I noticed it after I started doing more yard work, but I shower every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. “Musky” gives me a little more to work with. And it’s good you’ve noticed it even with daily showering. The fact that you've recently increased your yard work is also relevant. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I’m 49, divorced, and I work as a floor layer – not carpet, wood, or tile, the other stuff. It’s pretty physical work, lots of bending and lifting. I don’t have any major health problems that I know of. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was it. I try to eat reasonably well, though sometimes it’s hard when you’re working all day. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Oh, and I take a daily multivitamin. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. Knowing your occupation and activity level is important. The gallbladder removal is good to have on record as well. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and she was diabetic towards the end of her life. My father had heart problems, I think. And my grandmother on my mother’s side had arthritis, really bad arthritis in her hands. Nothing else that I can really think of, honestly. They’re both gone now, so it's hard to remember everything. No one had any weird smells or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, and yes, that does help. Knowing about the history of diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis is useful. And it's good to know there's no family history of anything similar regarding body odor. Now, are you currently taking any medications other than the multivitamin?
PATIENT: No, just the multivitamin. I haven't needed anything else, thankfully. I get a yearly check-up with my primary care doctor, and everything’s always been fine. She did prescribe me some ibuprofen a few times for my back, but I haven’t taken it in months. I try to stretch and avoid lifting anything too heavy when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. It sounds like you’re proactive about your health, which is great. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at your skin to see if there are any obvious causes for the change in odor. It’s a pretty straightforward exam, and it will help me narrow down the possibilities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I haven’t noticed anything on my skin, but you can take a look, of course. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear, normal rhythm. I don't see any rashes, lesions, or obvious signs of infection on your skin. Your skin is generally healthy in appearance. I do notice a slightly different odor, as you described, but it’s not overwhelmingly strong. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is 72, regular. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, a few things could be going on. Sometimes, changes in diet or increased sweating can alter body odor. The increased yard work could be contributing. However, since the odor is different and persistent, we should rule out some other possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. I haven’t changed my diet much, but the yard work definitely makes me sweat more. What other possibilities are you thinking about? I’m a little nervous, to be honest. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous, Kerriann. It's good you're being proactive about this. While it's unlikely to be something serious, it's always best to be thorough. Sometimes, changes in body odor can be related to hormonal fluctuations, particularly as we get older. Another possibility, although less common, is a condition called trimethylaminuria, also known as “fish odor syndrome.” It’s a rare metabolic disorder where the body can’t properly break down certain compounds, leading to a distinctive odor. Less likely, but something to consider. We’ll want to rule that out with some lab tests. Finally, rarely, changes in body odor can be associated with certain medical conditions, like kidney or liver problems, but given your overall health and the normal findings of my exam, those are less likely. Would you be comfortable getting a urine sample and a blood test to check your kidney and liver function, as well as to screen for trimethylaminuria?
PATIENT: Okay, that's a lot of information. Hormonal fluctuations makes sense, I guess. I am 49, after all. I've never heard of "fish odor syndrome" – that sounds unpleasant! And kidney or liver problems… that does sound scary. Yes, I’m comfortable getting the tests. I just want to know what’s going on and make sure it's nothing serious. So, urine and blood tests. Okay. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable approach, Kerriann. And you’re right to want to get to the bottom of this. I’ll have the nurse draw a standard metabolic panel, which will include kidney and liver function tests. We'll also add a test to check your urine for trimethylamine. The nurse will give you instructions for collecting a urine sample – it just needs to be a routine mid-stream sample, and it’s best if it’s collected first thing in the morning. The lab results usually take a few days to come back – typically around three to five business days. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or changes in your urination, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Three to five days is fine. And I will call if anything changes. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It’s a little nerve-wracking, but I feel better knowing we’re looking into it. So, I’ll go talk to the nurse now to get the instructions for the urine sample?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I understand it’s nerve-wracking, and I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. We’ll get those tests done, and we’ll take it from there. Yes, please go speak with the nurse – she’ll get you set up with the instructions for the urine sample and draw the blood for the lab work. She’s right this way. Please let me know if you have any questions for me before you go. Otherwise, I’ll see you in about a week when the lab results are back. Take care.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. I think that’s all for now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before our follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
