DOCTOR: Hi Darl, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Dr. Yoshino, you said? My… my daughter, she thought it would be a good idea for me to get some… some blood work done. Something about knowing my… what do you call it? My blood type? Yes, that’s it. She worries so. I can’t quite remember why it’s important, but she insisted.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of her. Knowing your blood type is good preventative information, and it’s always good to have that on file, just in case. It’s also helpful if you ever need a transfusion, though let’s hope that’s not something we have to worry about anytime soon! I see here you’re 79 years old. Have you been generally healthy, or have you had any medical issues in the past that we should discuss while we're at it?
PATIENT: Seventy-nine, is it? Seems like yesterday I was a young woman… Oh dear, where was I? Yes… healthy enough, I suppose. I’ve had the usual aches and pains for an old woman, you know? My knees aren't what they used to be, and I get a bit tired easily. I worked as a rigger for many years, you see. Lots of lifting and climbing. I don’t recall anything major… maybe some bad colds now and then. Oh! And I had a bit of trouble with my gallbladder years ago, but I think they… they fixed it. A long time ago, though. Really, I can’t recall the details. It was before… before my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Rigging – that is physically demanding work! No wonder your knees are bothering you. You mentioned gallbladder trouble. Do you remember roughly when you had that surgery?
PATIENT: Surgery… oh my. Let me think… It was… a long time ago. Before the internet, definitely. Hmm… perhaps the early nineties? Or maybe the late eighties? It was a while after we moved to… well, it doesn’t matter where we moved. Everything’s a bit blurry, you know? It was a simpler time, that’s for sure. It wasn't a big surgery, if that helps. I was back on my feet fairly quickly. My husband, bless his soul, he took good care of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, the early nineties gives us something to work with. And good to hear you recovered well. Now, thinking about other medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… High blood… does that mean my numbers were too high? The doctor used to check, yes. I remember sitting there with that cuff around my arm. I think he said something about watching my salt intake. Salt… I always liked a little salt with my food. As for diabetes… I don’t believe so. I don’t recall anything about sugar. And my heart… well, it’s still beating, isn’t it? I’ve never been told I had anything wrong with my heart. I used to walk miles to work every day. A strong heart, I always thought. Though, maybe I should have seen a specialist… but I never got around to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some monitoring of blood pressure in the past, and no known diabetes or heart problems. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medicines, vitamins, or over-the-counter drugs regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Vitamins, yes. My daughter brings me a multi-vitamin every month. A big orange one. I take that with my breakfast. And… sometimes I take something for my knees when they really bother me. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called? The little white pills. But not every day, just when they ache. I don’t take anything else regularly. I used to take something for my… for my nerves, when my husband was ill, but that was a long time ago. I can't remember what it was called now, though. Nothing for blood pressure or anything like that. Just the vitamins and the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to love flowers, and we always had a cat when I was a girl. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. My husband was allergic to pollen, I think. He used to sneeze a lot in the springtime. But I was always fine. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. At least, not that I know of. Maybe a little sensitive to the cold sometimes, but that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, sensitivity to the cold wouldn't be considered an allergy. Okay, that gives me a pretty good picture of your medical history. Now, let’s move on to some quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and my husband… well, he didn't smoke either. We both preferred fresh air. No, definitely not a smoker. It smelled awful, anyway. I always stayed away from people who were smoking. It made my eyes water.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, we used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Spanish wine, usually. A nice Rioja. But not every night, just on special occasions. And it's been… oh, a long time since I had any wine. My daughter doesn't really drink, and I don't want to drink alone. So, not really. Very little alcohol, these days. Just a sip now and then at Christmas, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, very minimal alcohol use. Now, about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That's a tricky one. My mother lived to be quite old, but I don’t remember her having any particular illnesses. She just… wore out, I suppose. My father… he passed away when I was young. I think he had something with his lungs, but I don’t recall the details. And my brother… he was always a healthy fellow. No, I don’t recall any major illnesses running in the family. Lots of strong people, mostly. But it was a long time ago, you know? Things weren't written down as much then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, finally, let's talk about your current situation. You mentioned your daughter brought you in today. Are you generally active, and how are you feeling right now?
PATIENT: Oh, my daughter, she worries so! Yes, she brought me. I'm not as active as I used to be, of course. I mostly stay around the house. I enjoy reading and watching television. I get a bit tired easily, like I said. But I'm feeling alright right now. A little stiff, maybe, but nothing too bad. I had a nice breakfast this morning. And the weather is lovely, isn't it? Just a little… forgetful sometimes, that's all. But who isn't at my age? I feel… content. Just a bit worried about what you're going to do with all this information! Is it serious?
DOCTOR: No, it's not serious at all! It’s just important to have a complete picture of your health so I can provide the best possible care. The forgetfulness is normal at your age, too, and we can certainly talk about that if it's concerning to you. Okay, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… fine. If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgement, dear. My daughter always said I should listen to the doctors. Heart, lungs, and… that cuff again? Yes, alright. Do whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just listening to your heart now. Deep breaths for me, please. Sounds good, a regular rhythm, no murmurs that I detect. Now I’m going to listen to your lungs. Again, just take some nice, deep breaths. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackling. And now for that cuff again. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not terribly high, but something we should keep an eye on. And finally, just checking your pulse. It's regular and strong. Everything seems generally good. The blood pressure is a little higher than ideal, but it's not a cause for immediate alarm. It's important to monitor that.
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad. Elevated, you say? Is that from the heat, perhaps? It's been quite warm lately. I’m glad to hear my heart and lungs are alright. I always worried about my heart. And now, about my blood type? That’s what my daughter wanted to know, wasn't it? Is it something serious? Will it change anything? I feel a little silly coming all this way just to find out what type of blood I have. But she insisted. She's a good girl, my daughter. Just a little overprotective, perhaps. So, what is it? What's my blood type?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all! Knowing your blood type is good preventative information, and it's helpful to have on file. And yes, your daughter is very thoughtful. Okay, your blood type is A positive. That means you have the A antigen on your red blood cells and you have the Rh factor. It's one of the most common blood types. Do you have any questions about what that means?
PATIENT: A positive… A positive. Is that good? Is that what most people have? I don’t think I’ve ever even thought about my blood type before today. I just… live. My daughter will be so relieved. She’s always making lists and checking things off. Now she can check this off her list. What does it mean, though? Will I need special medicine? Will I have to avoid certain foods? I don't want to have to change my routine, dear. I like my routine. It’s… comforting. So, A positive. Is that… safe? Am I safe?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly safe, Darl. A positive is a very common blood type, and it doesn't mean you need any special medicine or to change your routine. You don't need to worry about avoiding certain foods. It's important to know your blood type primarily for blood transfusions. If you ever needed a transfusion – for example, after an injury or surgery – knowing your blood type helps ensure you receive the correct type of blood. People with different blood types can have dangerous reactions if they receive the wrong type. There’s no immediate action needed, and you don’t need to worry about anything. It's just good information to have on file. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. So, it’s for… emergencies. If something happens. Well, that makes sense, I suppose. My daughter will be happy to know that everything is… safe. She worries about everything, you see. No, I think that’s all. You’ve been very kind, dear. And patient. It’s hard for me to remember things these days, so I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Perhaps a little bit of paper with my blood type on it? Just in case I forget. Or my daughter forgets. She sometimes forgets things, too, even though she makes lists. Yes, a little piece of paper would be lovely. Then I can rest easy. And so can my daughter. Thank you, dear. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. Keep this with your important papers. And don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It was a pleasure meeting you, Darl. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect. A little piece of paper. Just what I needed. Thank you, dear. You're a very good doctor. No, I think that's all. Everything's fine now. My daughter will be so relieved. And I'm relieved, too. I can go home and have a nice cup of tea. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. You've been wonderful. I think I’ll just let myself out then. Thank you, dear. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your tea. Take care.
