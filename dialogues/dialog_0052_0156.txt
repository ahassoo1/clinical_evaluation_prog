DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Shely. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it's my stomach. It’s been… not good, lately. Really watery, you know? Like… diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit, and honestly, I’m starting to get worried. I… I think someone mentioned something about it being connected to something I have? I can’t quite remember what they said.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jase. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Diarrhea can be quite disruptive, and it’s wise to investigate the cause, especially if it’s been ongoing. You mentioned someone alluded to a connection with something you have… could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes, disruptive is… a good word for it. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly. And embarrassing. Okay, so… my husband, Omar, he keeps saying something about… something with how I digest food? He said a doctor told him years ago, when I was really sick, that I have… something that makes it hard for my body to handle certain things. I was pretty out of it then, to be honest. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the name of it. Something about… wheat? And my intestines? Does that… make sense? It feels like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound like rambling at all, Jase. You're providing very helpful information. It sounds like Omar believes you may have a condition affecting your digestion, potentially related to wheat and your intestines. Do you recall approximately when this initial illness occurred – perhaps the year or your age at the time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think… I was probably in my late teens? Maybe 18 or 19? So… around 2015 or 2016, maybe? It was before I met Omar. It was really bad then, I remember being… a lot weaker. I had to stay home from… something. School? Work? I really can't place it, it was a while ago. Everything was kind of a blur, honestly. They did a lot of tests, I think, but I didn't really pay attention to the results. Just… trusted the doctor to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand. That was quite a long time ago, and it's common to not recall all the details, especially when unwell. Let me access your electronic health record to see if we can find any information from that time period. …Ah, here we are. It appears you were diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 2016, following a series of tests to investigate chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Do you recall being placed on a gluten-free diet?
PATIENT: Celiac… yes, that sounds right! Celiac Disease. That’s it! Oh, that’s a relief, to finally remember something. A gluten-free diet… I think so? Omar definitely makes sure I don’t eat anything with wheat in it. He's very good at checking labels. I… I try to avoid it, but sometimes… I slip up. It’s hard when you’re eating out, you know? And some things just… look okay, but then… Well, you know. Is that why this is happening again? Is it because I haven’t been strict enough with the diet?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Jase. Dietary adherence is crucial with Celiac Disease. Even small amounts of gluten can trigger symptoms, and it sounds like occasional slips may be contributing to your current issue. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let’s see. For breakfast, I usually have… oatmeal, but Omar buys the gluten-free kind. Sometimes toast, also gluten-free. Lunch is usually a salad with chicken or fish. Omar makes it for me most days. Dinner… it varies. Sometimes chicken and rice, sometimes vegetables. We eat a lot of lentils. I try to be careful, really. But… I did have a piece of cake at my cousin’s birthday party last week. It was a small piece, and I didn’t think about it too much at the time. And… I had some fries when we went to that new diner last month. They didn't say they had gluten, but… I’m starting to wonder if they did. I just… I don't always ask, to be honest. It feels awkward.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open about that, Jase. It's very helpful to have that information. It's completely understandable that it can feel awkward to constantly inquire about ingredients. Given your history of Celiac Disease and recent potential gluten exposures, the current diarrhea is likely related to that. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. It's good to know what's going on, even if it’s not good news. I just… I want to feel better. And I really don't want to have to worry about food all the time. This is exhausting. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jase. It is exhausting. We'll work together to find a manageable solution. Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or unusual sounds at this time. Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. No masses are palpable. Based on your history and the physical exam, it is most likely that your current symptoms are a flare-up of your Celiac Disease, triggered by recent gluten ingestion. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your antibody levels, which can indicate an immune reaction to gluten. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood tests are fine. Anything to get this figured out. And… maybe help me remember to be more careful with what I eat? It's just… sometimes I forget. And Omar gets frustrated with me, and I feel bad. So, yes. Blood tests are good. Do I need to do anything to prepare? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Jase. We can absolutely order those blood tests. No specific preparation is required, you can eat and drink as usual. We’ll just need a small sample of blood. Typically, the results take 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. In the meantime, I would strongly recommend strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet. Avoiding even small amounts of gluten will allow your system to recover and provide a more accurate assessment with the blood tests. I'll also print out some educational materials on Celiac Disease and gluten-free living for you to review. We can also discuss strategies to help you manage your diet and avoid accidental gluten exposure. Perhaps a referral to a registered dietitian specializing in Celiac Disease could be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be amazing. A dietitian… yes, please! Omar would be so happy to hear that. He's really the one who keeps track of everything, and I feel terrible relying on him so much. So, just the blood tests for now, and then we’ll see about the dietitian? And the educational materials, of course. Thank you, Dr. Shely. You’ve already made me feel a lot better, just by listening. It’s nice to feel like someone understands. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. It’s important to remember you’re not alone in this, and we’ll work together to manage your condition effectively. I’ll arrange for the blood tests to be drawn today. The lab technician will guide you through the process. And I’ll put in a referral for a registered dietitian who specializes in Celiac Disease. They can provide personalized guidance and support. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in approximately one week to discuss the blood test results and develop a comprehensive management plan. Does that work for you?
