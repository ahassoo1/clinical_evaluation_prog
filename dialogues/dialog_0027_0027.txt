DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s this… stuff. Coming back up. Food, you know? It just… regurgitates. It’s awful. Been happening a while now, and frankly, I don’t have time for this. I'm an Emergency Management Director, people rely on me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite unpleasant. “Coming back up,” you say… food?
PATIENT: Yes, food. What else would it be? Look, I eat, it goes down, then it comes up. Sometimes right after, sometimes a few hours later. It doesn't matter what I eat, really. Though, spicy stuff is worse. Obviously. Are we going to figure this out or…?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, we'll try to figure this out. It’s good you mention the spicy food making it worse, that’s helpful. When did this start happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Good grief. Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my regurgitation episodes. Probably… six months, maybe? It started gradually, just a little bit, now it’s… more noticeable. Look, I'm a practical man, I don't need a precise timeline. It’s happening, okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months… gradual onset. And it’s not associated with any particular event?
PATIENT: Associated with...? Listen, things happen, life happens. I don't sit around analyzing every bite I take! No, nothing specific. Though, my wife's been making more… adventurous meals lately. Not saying it's her fault, but… sometimes I wonder.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s been happening consistently over the past six months, and it doesn’t seem tied to a single incident. And adventurous meals could be a factor. Do you experience any other symptoms along with this—heartburn, bloating, nausea, weight loss, for example?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Good lord, no. I'm a thin man already! See? I haven't got an ounce to spare. Bloating… sometimes, maybe. A little uncomfortable. And heartburn… occasionally, yes. Not every time, though. Honestly, the regurgitation is the worst part. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant weight loss. Some bloating and occasional heartburn accompanying the regurgitation. Let’s talk about your diet a little more… beyond your wife's adventurous meals. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not going to list every single thing I eat. It’s normal food! Breakfast, lunch, dinner. I skip a snack sometimes. I eat… responsibly, you could say. I’m not one of these people who lives on junk food. I eat meat, vegetables, potatoes… What do you want me to tell you? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that. Just trying to get a general sense. Do you find that certain types of meat or vegetables are more likely to cause this?
PATIENT: Spicy ones. As I already said. Anything with a lot of pepper. And… tomatoes. Tomatoes are bad. Give me a plain piece of chicken any day. None of those fancy sauces, though. I just… I don’t need all the bells and whistles. I'm a simple man, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, spicy foods and tomatoes seem to be the main culprits. And it sounds like bland foods are better tolerated. Now, before we proceed, have you tried any medications for this already?
PATIENT: Medications? Really? You think I haven’t thought of that? My wife keeps offering me something… pink and fizzy. I haven’t taken it. I don't just pop pills, doctor. I like to understand why something is happening before I start shoving chemicals down my throat.
DOCTOR: A very sensible approach, Mr. Altine. It sounds like the pink and fizzy medication is an antacid. Alright, to try and understand this better, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick, I have a meeting in two hours. And don’t poke too much, I’m a sensitive man. Seriously. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. Deep breaths, please. Not a lot of distress here, but there's a slight rumbling sound. Anything painful when I press here?
PATIENT: No! Don't poke! It's just… uncomfortable. Sensitive. I told you. It's probably just gas. A simple man has simple digestion. Can we please move this along?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No significant tenderness. It does sound like some gas is present, as you suspected. Given your symptoms - the regurgitation, particularly after spicy foods and tomatoes, occasional heartburn, and some bloating - it could be acid reflux or GERD. I'm also noting the rumbling sound that suggests some possible slow digestion. To confirm, I would recommend a simple test. A pH monitoring study can help determine if acid is coming up into your esophagus. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A test? Seriously? You want to stick a tube down my throat? No. Absolutely not. Look, I don't need a fancy test to tell me I'm spitting up my food. It’s obvious! I'm a practical man, I need solutions, not procedures. Can’t you just give me something to stop it?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance. While a pH monitoring study would give us a clearer picture, we can certainly start with some management strategies. Given what you've told me, I recommend a trial of a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. This medication helps reduce stomach acid production, which should alleviate your symptoms. I’m going to prescribe Omeprazole, 20mg once daily, before breakfast. I also recommend avoiding spicy foods, tomatoes, and large meals, especially before bed. Try to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Finally, a sensible answer. Fine. Omeprazole. Once a day. Before breakfast. Got it. As long as it doesn't have a million side effects and require me to completely overhaul my life, I'm willing to try it. And, no. No questions. Just… get it over with. Can I leave now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. The Omeprazole prescription has been sent electronically to your pharmacy. Common side effects are usually mild—headache, nausea, diarrhea. If you experience anything more severe, please contact the office immediately. If your symptoms don't improve after two weeks on this medication, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss further testing. Here's a summary of everything we discussed. And yes, you’re free to leave now. I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
