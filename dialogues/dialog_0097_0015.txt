DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome! It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you too. Um... my sinuses, they are... bothering me. For a little while now. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bothering” is a good start. Can you tell me a little more about how they’re bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… full. Like there’s… pressure? Behind my face. And… sometimes it’s hard to breathe through my nose. Not all the time, but… often enough. It’s… uncomfortable, yes. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It is… difficult to think straight when it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure behind your face and difficulty breathing through your nose, happening on and off for a few weeks, and impacting your ability to think clearly sometimes. That sounds frustrating. Do you have any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really pain. More… a heavy feeling. And… sometimes, a little… achy. But not like a headache. It’s just… not comfortable. I do not know if that makes sense? Is it… bad? I haven't taken anything for it.
DOCTOR: No, it makes perfect sense. Heavy feeling and some aching, but no sharp pain. And you haven’t been taking anything for it yet, okay. Do you have any fever, cough, or sore throat along with this sinus feeling?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I do not think so. I haven't checked, actually. And no cough. No sore throat, either. Just… the fullness. And it makes my head feel… slow. Like trying to push through water, you know? It is… hard to explain. I work… outside, so maybe dust? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, cough, or sore throat, just the sinus fullness, a heavy feeling, and a sort of mental sluggishness. Working outside could certainly contribute, that’s a good thought. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste recently?
PATIENT: Smell… oh. Yes! Now that you say it. Things do not smell… as strong. I thought it was just… getting older, maybe? My husband, he says he doesn't notice a difference. But I… sometimes I have to get closer to smell things. Like cooking. Or… the flowers in the garden. I didn't think it was important. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a decreased sense of smell – that is important information. It’s good you mentioned that. And it's definitely worth looking into, even if your husband hasn't noticed a change. Now, just to get a better picture, have you had any previous sinus infections or problems with your sinuses before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I don't remember, Doctor. I've been sick many times, of course. Everyone gets sick. But… a sinus infection? Specifically? I don't think so. Maybe when I was a little girl? It was a long time ago. I do not have good memory. My husband… he might know. He remembers everything. But he is not here. I’ve never had to see a doctor for my sinuses before this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific history of sinus infections that you recall, and you haven't needed to see a doctor for this before. That's good to know. Would you mind if I take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Please, do what you need to. I hope you can help me feel better. It is… difficult to work when my head feels like this.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, I’m just going to take a look in your ears with this instrument, then a quick look up your nose, and finally I'll check your throat. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay, your ears look clear. Your throat is a little red, but nothing too concerning. And when I looked in your nose, your nasal passages are a little swollen, and there’s some mucus present. No signs of any polyps or major obstruction. Your lymph nodes feel normal.
PATIENT: Oh… good. Swollen, you say? Mucus… is that bad? I hope it is not too serious. I just want to feel normal again. I work very hard. It is important I do not get sick. Is it… a cold, maybe? Or something I need medicine for?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know it's not anything obviously more serious. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve seen during the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses. It could be viral – like a bad cold – or bacterial. The redness in your throat suggests some possible viral component. Right now, given the lack of high fever and the mild nature of your symptoms, I'd recommend a conservative approach. We can try supportive care first. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Supportive care…? What does that mean, exactly, Doctor? I am not very good with medical words. Does it mean… rest? Is there something I can take? I need to know if I need to stay home from work. It is very important I do not miss too much time.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarification, and absolutely no need to feel bad about not understanding medical terms! Supportive care means things that help your body heal on its own. So that includes plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids – water, tea, juice – and avoiding irritants like dust, smoke, or strong smells as much as possible. I’d also recommend over-the-counter saline nasal spray – you can find that at any pharmacy – to help keep your nasal passages moist and clear out mucus. And you can try an over-the-counter pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen if you have any aches or discomfort. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven't ever been told I am allergic to anything. Sometimes, when I'm gardening, my skin gets a little itchy. But I thought it was just the plants. And my husband… he says I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes! He says I get it from the dust. Is dust an allergy? I do not know. I’ve never been to an allergist.
DOCTOR: Dust can certainly be an irritant and trigger allergy-like symptoms, though it's hard to say definitively without testing. It’s good you haven’t been officially diagnosed with any allergies. Given your symptoms, history, and the lack of known allergies, I’d like to start with this conservative approach for the next week. If you don't see any improvement within a week, or if your symptoms worsen – like if you develop a high fever, severe headache, facial pain, or vision changes – it’s important to come back in, and we may need to consider other options, like antibiotics or a referral to an ENT specialist. Does that sound like a plan you’re comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Rest, fluids, the spray… and if it gets worse, I come back. A week… yes. I can do that. Thank you. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I hope it helps. Is there anything else I should be doing? Or… should I avoid anything specifically?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify things. Avoid smoking or being around smoke if possible. Also, try to avoid close contact with people who are sick. And as I mentioned, try to minimize exposure to dust and strong irritants. Over the counter decongestants can provide temporary relief, but I don’t recommend using them for more than a few days, as they can sometimes worsen symptoms in the long run. I’m going to write you a little note summarizing these instructions and recommending the saline spray. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think you explained everything very well, Doctor. Rest, fluids, spray, avoid smoke… and come back if it’s worse. I will try my best. Thank you for being patient with me. It is hard for me to remember things. I appreciate you taking the time to explain. I think that is all.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mikeisha. It’s absolutely no problem at all. I'm happy to take the time to ensure you understand everything. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions that come up later. I hope you feel better soon! And please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You too. Have a good day.
