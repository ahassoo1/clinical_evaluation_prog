DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... my eyesight, you see. It’s been going. Not suddenly, mind you, but… diminishing. It’s rather inconvenient, and frankly, a bit concerning. I used to be able to read a sign across the road, now… not so much. It's just not right.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Diminishing” is a good way to put it. And when did you first start noticing this change, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult question, to be precise. Probably… six months ago, give or take. At first, I just thought it was the lighting, or perhaps I hadn’t had enough sleep. One does have responsibilities, you know. It wasn’t immediately alarming. But it's certainly progressed since then. It’s not a swift decline, but it’s… noticeable. I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Definitely both. Though… I suppose my left eye is a touch worse. It’s… difficult to explain. It’s not a sharp difference, not like one is completely gone and the other is fine. Just… a general fuzziness, you see? A lack of clarity in both. And things seem… dimmer overall. It’s just not as… vibrant as it used to be.
DOCTOR: And do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always had perfectly good eyesight, right up until recently. It's… unsettling, to be frank. My father had excellent vision his entire life, as did his father before him. It's not something I ever anticipated needing. It’s simply… not in the family history. Are you certain it couldn't be something else? Perhaps just strain? I do spend a good deal of time reviewing documents at work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, while family history is a factor, it doesn't preclude the possibility of changes. And yes, strain can contribute. However, given the progression over six months and involvement of both eyes, we need to investigate further. Let’s perform a quick visual acuity test. Please follow me to the exam chair. I'll need you to read the letters on the chart, starting with the largest.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I find it rather presumptuous to assume it’s not simply a matter of fatigue. I assure you, my work is quite demanding. Still… if you insist. Lead the way. I trust this won’t take long? I have rather a full afternoon.
DOCTOR: Please sit comfortably and keep your glasses off – you mentioned you don’t wear them, correct?
PATIENT: Correct. No glasses, never have. I suppose we should get this over with then. Though I remain skeptical, I will attempt to cooperate. Just… try to be quick about it. I do have deadlines, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Alcorta. Starting with the top row, can you read me the letters?
PATIENT: Is that… an F? No… a P, perhaps? It’s terribly blurry, Doctor. Honestly, this is rather frustrating. It’s all just… smudged. Is it possible the chart isn't focused properly? I wouldn’t want to misread something due to faulty equipment.
DOCTOR: The chart is properly calibrated, Mr. Alcorta. Let's move to the next row. Don't strain; just tell me what you can discern. Your visual acuity is approximately 20/70 in both eyes. That's significantly reduced. I'm going to perform a basic fundoscopic exam now to assess the back of your eyes. It won't be comfortable, but it’s necessary.
PATIENT: 20/70? That… doesn’t sound very good, does it? And what precisely is a “fundoscopic exam”? You're not going to poke me in the eye, are you? I have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, Doctor. And truthfully, this whole process feels… rather rushed. Shouldn’t we explore other possibilities before resorting to… poking? Perhaps a different lighting environment? Or a more thorough review of my medical history? I did mention the stress at work, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, a fundoscopic exam involves using an ophthalmoscope to view the retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels at the back of your eye. It is not poking. It is a standard procedure. And while stress can exacerbate certain conditions, it’s highly unlikely to cause a 20/70 visual acuity bilaterally. I need to rule out other causes. Please fix your gaze on a point straight ahead. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but remain still. I’m noting some mild pallor of the optic discs bilaterally and some narrowing of the arterioles. This requires further investigation. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a more detailed evaluation.
PATIENT: Pallor? Arterioles? You're speaking a language I simply don't understand, Doctor. And frankly, I find this entire exercise rather alarming. "Further investigation"? What precisely does that entail? More poking, I presume? And an… "ophthalmologist"? Another doctor? This is becoming quite inconvenient. A complete blood count… is that expensive? I'm not even insured, you see. Honestly, I suspect this is simply a case of overwork and fatigue. A week’s vacation should resolve this issue. But… very well. Order your tests, I suppose. But I expect a detailed explanation of the costs beforehand. And a referral doesn't mean I'm immediately agreeing to further procedures. I’ll need to consider my options. And perhaps… a second opinion.
DOCTOR: The cost of the bloodwork is approximately $150 without insurance. I will provide you with a requisition form and the clinic can direct you to a local lab. An ophthalmologist is a specialist in eye care, Mr. Alcorta, and is best suited to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of your vision loss. While a vacation may alleviate some symptoms, it’s irresponsible to dismiss a significant change in vision without a proper diagnosis. I am also providing you with a printout outlining potential causes of vision loss, including optic neuropathy and vascular disease. Please schedule an appointment with the ophthalmologist within the next two weeks. I will follow up with you regarding the bloodwork results, but I strongly advise you to prioritize the specialist referral. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Optic… neuropathy? Vascular… disease? It sounds dreadful. Honestly, Doctor, you’re not instilling much confidence. $150… it’s rather steep, but I suppose I have little choice. I’ll schedule the appointment, reluctantly. But I must reiterate, I remain skeptical. And I expect a thorough explanation of all options, including the costs, before any further procedures are undertaken. I do not appreciate being rushed or patronized. Very well. I believe that is all for now. I’ll… be in touch. Thank you… I suppose.
