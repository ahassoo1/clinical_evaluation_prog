DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Chest… hurts. And… heart goes thump-thump. Blood pressure… wife says it’s high. She make me come. Waste of time, probably. Just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s good of your wife to be attentive to your health, and it's certainly worthwhile to investigate any changes, even if they seem minor. “Chest hurts” and a “thump-thump” sensation in your heart, along with your wife’s concern about your blood pressure – all good things to discuss. Could you tell me a bit more about the chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more is there to tell? It hurts. Like… a squeezing. Not all the time. When I… walk too much. Or… get upset. My wife always yelling. Maybe that’s it. Makes my chest tight. It’s not… a good feeling. You understand English, yes? Don't need fancy words.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Sobkowicz, I absolutely understand. And I apologize if I was asking for too much detail initially. “Squeezing” is a very helpful description. It sounds like the pain is related to activity and stress – that's important information. Just to clarify, when you say "walk too much," about how far do you typically walk before the pain starts?
PATIENT: How far? Hmph. I used to walk miles. Now? Maybe… to the mailbox. And back. That’s too much, usually. Used to be strong. Very strong. Now… everything hurts. Don't ask me to measure. I don't have time for that. Just… old. It's old age, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your activity level has decreased, and the pain limits how much you can do now. It’s good you’re able to tell me that walking to the mailbox brings on the pain. Has this pain been getting worse lately, or has it been about the same?
PATIENT: Worse. Definitely worse. Used to be… just a little uncomfortable. Now… I have to stop. Sit down. Catch my breath. Wife gets angry. Says I need to see doctor. I tell her… I’m fine. But she… she doesn’t listen. Always making a fuss. It's annoying. This whole thing is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: It sounds very frustrating to have your concerns dismissed, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s important to me that we address your concerns, and the fact that the pain is getting worse is something we definitely need to investigate further. Now, besides the chest pain and the sensation of your heart racing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I get tired. Very tired. But I'm eighty-six years old! What do you expect? Sometimes… a little dizzy. But that’s just… getting up too fast. Nothing important. My wife… she worries about everything. She’s a good woman, but… always making a list of things. She probably has a list of my symptoms right now. Probably wrong ones too.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re able to describe these things, Mr. Sobkowicz. Fatigue and occasional dizziness are important to mention, even if they seem like normal parts of aging. It helps me get a complete picture of what's going on. Would you mind if I quickly review your wife’s list, if she has one?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. If you must. But don’t expect a lot. She exaggerates. Always does. She thinks I’m made of glass. Here. Just… be quick. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Sobkowicz. I see here your wife notes some shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles, and some palpitations – a fluttering or racing sensation in your chest, in addition to what we’ve already discussed. Does this sound accurate to you?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… yes. When I try to walk. Like I said. And… ankles. Sometimes they feel… puffy. Especially at night. She has to help me with my socks. Palpitations… that’s just the thump-thump. She gives everything a fancy name. She thinks she’s a doctor herself. Just… get on with it. What are you going to do? Give me a pill? It won't help. Nothing helps anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with these symptoms for a while, and you’re understandably skeptical that anything will help. Before prescribing anything, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and listen to your heart and lungs. This will give me a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. But don't take too long. I have… appointments. Important appointments. Just… be gentle. My bones are old. Very old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And I am hearing a slight murmur – an extra sound – when listening to your heart. Your lungs sound a little congested, meaning there’s some fluid buildup. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as your wife mentioned. I’m going to palpate your ankles to assess the degree of edema. Now, I'd like to take a look at your feet.
PATIENT: Hmph. Congested, is it? Just old age. Everything's old. Don't need to write it down. I know my own body. It’s falling apart. Careful! That's… tender. See? It’s just old. And… feet? What about my feet? They're just… feet. I walk with them. That’s all. This is a waste of time. I’m telling you. A complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Sobkowicz. However, even with age, it’s important to investigate these changes to ensure we’re not missing anything serious. The tenderness in your ankles and the congestion in your lungs, along with the murmur and elevated blood pressure, suggest there may be more going on than just typical aging. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. These include an EKG to check your heart rhythm, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
