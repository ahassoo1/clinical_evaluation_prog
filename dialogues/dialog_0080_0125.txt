DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be perfectly frank, my wife insisted. She's a bit…overly cautious, you know? She wanted me to get checked for…that HIV thing. I don't really see the point, but here I am. It's just a precaution, I suppose. Though I haven't done anything to need a precaution, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, even if you're not experiencing any symptoms. And it's very common for partners to encourage check-ups, so no worries there. Just to be clear, you’re coming in today specifically for HIV testing as a precaution, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A precaution. That’s the word. My wife keeps reading things online, and now she’s convinced everyone needs to be tested regularly. Honestly, it feels a bit…dramatic. But she’s the one who handles the insurance, so…Medicare covers this, right? Because I really don’t want to have to argue about bills with her on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does cover HIV testing, thankfully. We can certainly get that processed without any issues. It's good your wife is thinking about preventative care, even if it feels a bit much at times. Now, to get started, I'm going to ask you a few questions – just routine things. Have you ever had an HIV test before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. I mean, I’ve had blood tests for other things, obviously, when I get my annual physical. But never specifically for that. It’s never seemed necessary, honestly. I’ve always been… careful, you could say. My wife will probably disagree with that assessment, but… there you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. It's perfectly alright if you haven't had one before. We all have different healthcare journeys. And it doesn’t matter how careful you are – testing is just a smart way to ensure your health. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! What kind of a question is that? I've never… I mean, that's a rather insulting implication, don't you think? I assure you, I don’t engage in… that sort of behaviour. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to wonder if this whole thing is necessary. I'm a respectable man, not some… risk factor.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question came across insensitively, Jacquille. It’s standard procedure – we ask everyone the same questions to get a complete picture of their risk factors, absolutely no judgment intended. It’s simply part of the screening process to ensure accurate testing and appropriate care. We're just covering all bases. Let me rephrase. Have you ever received a blood transfusion or organ transplant?
PATIENT: Right. Standard procedure. I suppose. Still…it’s a bit much, isn’t it? Fine. No, I have never had a blood transfusion or an organ transplant. I’ve been perfectly healthy, as I said. I donate blood regularly, in fact. I’m the one giving, not receiving. Though I doubt Medicare covers that, does it? Honestly, this whole process is rather…degrading. It feels like you're treating me like… well, never mind. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jacquille, and I apologize again if the questions feel intrusive. You’re right to be proactive about your health with blood donations, and no, Medicare doesn’t typically cover that, unfortunately. We just need to gather all the information to ensure we’re providing the best possible care. Okay. Just a few more questions, then we can move on to the test. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to offend me? This is ridiculous! My wife will be insufferable if she hears about this line of questioning. I've been married for fifteen years! Fifteen! Do you honestly think I've been running around with… well, you know. I find this entire consultation deeply insulting and frankly, unprofessional. It's one thing to ask about blood transfusions, but this is… beyond the pale. I think I’ll just go home. This is clearly a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Jacquille, I sincerely apologize. It's clear I've misjudged the situation and caused you offense, and that was absolutely not my intention. You are right to be upset. I am adhering to guidelines for comprehensive STI screening, but I should have approached this with more sensitivity and consideration for your personal history. Please, let's stop this line of questioning. We can proceed with the HIV test without discussing your sexual history, if that is your preference. We can also document your concerns about the consultation. I truly value your time and want to ensure you feel comfortable and respected. Would you like to continue with the test, or would you prefer to reschedule?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…just get the test over with. I don’t want to discuss any of this. And please, don’t write anything negative about me in your notes. My wife has a way of finding things out. Just…the test. Quickly. Is it a finger prick? Because I despise needles. Honestly, the whole thing is a fiasco. A complete and utter fiasco.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a simple finger prick. It will be quick, I promise. And I will absolutely respect your privacy and document your wishes regarding your chart. I apologize again for the discomfort this has caused. Let me clean your finger with an alcohol swab… this may sting for a moment. Okay, all done. We should have results in about 20 minutes. I'll step out for a moment to allow you some privacy, and I’ll be back shortly with the results. Is there anything I can get you while we wait?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…leave me alone for twenty minutes. And please, try not to look so… judgmental. It’s really rather unnerving. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even coming here. This whole experience has been thoroughly unpleasant. Twenty minutes, then I'd like to go home. And the results… I suppose I'll believe them when I see them. Though I highly doubt… well, never mind. Just twenty minutes. Alone.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Twenty minutes of privacy. I’ll step out now and return shortly with the results. Please, don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
PATIENT: .
