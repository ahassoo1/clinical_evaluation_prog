DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, but I have been noticing things. Little things, mostly. I forget where I put my keys, or what I was just saying. It is… worrying. My blood pressure has been high for some time, and I am afraid it is affecting my mind.
DOCTOR: Right. "Noticing things," you say. And you attribute this to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is what I believe. My husband… he passed two years ago, and I have been managing everything myself since then. The property, the community association… a great deal. I keep everything very organized, always have. But lately… the organization feels less solid. It is as if the… the threads are loosening. And my doctor said my blood pressure is not helping.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, increased forgetfulness, a sense of things feeling less organized… and a history of recent stress with the loss of your husband and managing everything since then. When did you first start noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Perhaps… six months ago? It started very slowly, Doctor. I would misplace something, and think nothing of it. Then it became… more frequent. Now, almost every day, I question what I have already done. Did I lock the door? Did I send that email? I used to have a very strong memory. I could remember everything. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: And you said your blood pressure has been high for some time. Do you know what your typical readings are, or are you taking any medication for it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My usual reading is… around 160 over 90, sometimes higher. I do not take medication. I try to manage it with diet and… walking. But it is difficult. I do not like taking pills, if I can avoid it. My general practitioner suggested medication, but I… I hoped it would improve on its own. Perhaps I was foolish.
DOCTOR: Well, consistently elevated blood pressure can contribute to cognitive difficulties, it's true. However, memory problems can have many causes. Let's go through a bit more detail. Besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any changes in your speech?
PATIENT: Changes in my speech? I… I do not believe so. People understand me, I think. I sometimes struggle to find the right word, but that has always been true, to a small degree. Perhaps I am speaking slower? No, I don't think so. My friends have not mentioned anything. I am not sure. What do you mean by changes, exactly?
DOCTOR: I mean difficulty forming sentences, slurred speech, trouble understanding what people say to you… anything like that. It's just part of a routine assessment. Now, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No headaches. A little dizziness sometimes, when I stand up quickly, but I always assumed that was… my age. Or the blood pressure. And my vision… it is a little blurry sometimes, but I have glasses. I wear them every day. No changes to the vision, only the usual need for correction. It is not worse, just… normal. I hope that is clear. I try to be precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior?
PATIENT: Changes in my mood… That is a difficult question. I am… sad, sometimes. Of course. I miss my husband very much. But I try to be strong. I have responsibilities. I do not let it interfere with my duties. Perhaps I am more… irritable than before? But that could be the stress. It is hard, managing everything alone. I do not want to be a burden to anyone. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ve covered quite a bit. Now, let’s talk about past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – diabetes, heart disease, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I have always been… healthy. Aside from the blood pressure, of course. My husband… he had heart trouble, but I did not. I try to eat well, I exercise. I have always been careful. My general practitioner always said I was a model patient, until the blood pressure became a problem. A little arthritis in my hands, but that is all. I’m quite certain of that. Is there anything else you need to know? I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. I have never had a reason. I broke my arm when I was a child, but it healed perfectly with a cast. That is all. Nothing… invasive. I do not… care for hospitals. I avoid them whenever possible. It reminds me of my husband, and… well. It is unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had dementia, when she was very old. But she was ninety-five. My father… he died of a stroke, I believe. And my husband… heart disease, as I mentioned before. His father also had heart trouble. I… I do not know much about my grandparents. They passed away when I was very young. Is that helpful? I try to remember everything, but some things… they are just lost to time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As I said, I avoid pills whenever possible. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that is all. And a little something for the arthritis in my hands when it flares up, a cream, nothing serious. I prefer natural remedies, if I can. I drink herbal tea, I try to eat healthy. I do not rely on medication. It makes me feel… unwell. I do not believe I am forgetting anything now. Is there anything else you require? I would like to know what you think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Based on what you’ve told me—your recent memory changes, the history of high blood pressure, and the family history of dementia—it's important to investigate this further. While your blood pressure could certainly be contributing to these symptoms, it's essential to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to start with some basic cognitive testing here in the office. It’s a quick series of questions and tasks that will give us a baseline assessment of your memory and thinking skills. And I want to order some blood work to check for any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I would like to know what is happening. I do not want to ignore it, but I do not want to worry unnecessarily. Cognitive testing and blood work… yes. As long as it does not take too long. I have responsibilities, as you know. But I will do whatever is necessary. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll keep it as brief as possible. Let's start with the cognitive testing. It will take about twenty to thirty minutes. I'm going to ask you a series of questions, and I'll write down your answers. Don’t worry if you don’t remember everything perfectly. This is just to get a starting point. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… It is August 2nd, 2025. Yes, I am certain of that. I always check the calendar. It is important to keep track of such things. Though sometimes… I have to remind myself what year it is. But today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: We are in… a suburban area, Doctor. I do not know the specific name of the city. I do not pay much attention to those things. I know the general area. It is close to… to where my husband is buried. A quiet place. I do not believe knowing the city name is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them for me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Yes, I can remember those. They are… simple words. Apple, table, penny. I hope that is correct. It is… important to listen carefully, is it not? A good memory is a valuable thing. Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a simple question. What year did the Second World War end?
PATIENT: The Second World War… That is a difficult question, Doctor. It was… a long time ago. I believe it ended in… 1945? Yes, I think it was 1945. Though I was very young then. It is hard to remember specific dates. My husband… he was very knowledgeable about history. He would have known the exact date. But I believe it was 1945. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: …That is… a challenging request, Doctor. I do not often spell words backwards. Let me think… d-l-r-o-w. Is that correct? It feels… strange. I always spell words forwards. Perhaps I am not very good at this. d-l-r-o-w. I hope that is close enough. It is… unsettling to think in reverse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. We've completed that portion of the testing for now. I'm going to order a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a check of your folate levels. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I'll also need to discuss a potential referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. It's best to get a specialist's opinion to help determine the cause of these memory changes. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. A blood panel and a referral to a neurologist… yes. Whatever is necessary to find out what is happening. I trust your judgment. Although… a neurologist sounds… rather serious. But if it is necessary, then I will cooperate. I would prefer to know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. Yes, please proceed. I would like to know what the blood tests involve. How much blood will you need? I do not… care for needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Ms. Alvara. The blood draw will involve a standard vial of blood, perhaps two, to cover all the tests we need to run. It will be taken from your arm, and the process should only take a few minutes. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make sure you're as comfortable as possible. The neurologist will perform a more detailed cognitive assessment and may order further imaging scans, such as an MRI of your brain, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I will give you a form to schedule an appointment with the neurologist, and I will also provide you with the lab requisition for the blood work. Do you have any questions about any of this before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not believe so. Just… the speed, if possible. I do not like to dwell on these things. I understand the necessity, and I will cooperate. A neurologist and blood tests… yes. Please, let us get it done quickly. I have responsibilities, as you know. I would like to know how long the blood tests will take to come back. And how long I should expect to wait for a neurologist appointment. I need to plan my schedule. Thank you, Doctor. You are very efficient. I appreciate your directness. .
DOCTOR: Of course. The blood work results typically take about five to seven business days to come back. As for the neurologist appointment, wait times can vary, but I’ll ask my assistant to prioritize your referral. I estimate it could be anywhere from two to four weeks. My assistant will contact you to schedule the appointment once they have availability. I'll also send you a copy of the results as soon as they're available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today?
