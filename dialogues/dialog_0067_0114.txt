DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pfennig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because… well, it’s my breathing. It gets difficult when I try to lie flat. It's been happening for about a month now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulty when lying flat, for about a month. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… it feels like something is pressing on my chest. Not pain, exactly, more like… heaviness. And I have to use extra effort to breathe. I usually sleep propped up with a couple of pillows now. It’s better that way, but still not comfortable. I don’t recall anything happening to cause it, it just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright, heaviness in the chest with extra effort to breathe, better when propped up with pillows, and it came on gradually about a month ago. Do you notice any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my ankles swell up a bit in the evenings. Not terribly, but I do notice it. And I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am seventy-one years old, so… hard to say what’s normal at this point. I don't cough or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Maribeth. Swelling in your ankles and increased fatigue along with the breathing difficulty. No cough, that's good. Now, let's go through a bit more of your history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I was told years ago I had slightly high blood pressure, but it wasn’t… serious. My regular doctor put me on a water pill for a while, and it came down. I haven't been to a doctor regularly in… oh, goodness, a long time. Not since my divorce, I think. And no, no diabetes, and as far as I know, no heart problems. My ex-husband had some issues, but not me. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is helpful to know, thank you. So, high blood pressure in the past, treated with a water pill, and it resolved. No known diabetes or heart problems. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out when I was thirty-five. That was… 1980, I believe. And I was hospitalized once with a bad bout of pneumonia when I was a child, but that was… a very long time ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I recall needing surgery for.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in 1980 and pneumonia as a child. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any allergies that I am aware of. I eat everything. My late husband was allergic to shellfish, but I am fine. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication either, to my knowledge. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, just vitamin D in the winter. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother lived to be eighty-nine. She had some arthritis in her hips, but was otherwise healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, from a stroke, I believe. And I have a sister, still living, she’s a few years younger than me, and she has high blood pressure as well. That's about all I know. We weren't a very close family, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with arthritis, father with a stroke, and a sister with high blood pressure. Now, a few lifestyle questions, if you don't mind. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My late husband smoked, but I always made him go outside. Dreadful habit, if you ask me. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but just one. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Just one glass of wine with dinner. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be very active. I enjoyed gardening and walking. But with my breathing… it's harder now. I mostly stay inside and read. I used to volunteer at the library, but I haven’t been able to go lately. It takes too much effort. I mostly sit. I suppose I should be doing something, but… it's difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased activity due to breathing difficulties. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. Let’s get this over with, if you don’t mind. I have an appointment to water my neighbor's plants at three.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. If you could please sit here, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some crackles in your lungs, especially at the bases. That’s consistent with fluid buildup. I'm also going to check your ankles for swelling. Yes, there is some mild swelling present in both ankles. Your blood pressure is 150/90 today, which is a little elevated. And your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is on the lower end of normal. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure. The crackles in your lungs and ankle swelling, along with the breathing difficulties and elevated blood pressure, point in that direction. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better picture of what's going on. I also want to order some blood work to check your kidney function and rule out other possible causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart failure? Goodness. That sounds… serious. I haven’t felt that bad. But… if that’s what’s happening, I suppose I should find out. Yes, Doctor, order whatever tests you think are necessary. The sooner we know, the better. Just… please don't keep me waiting too long for the results. I really must get back to watering Mrs. Henderson’s plants.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Maribeth. It is a serious possibility, but it's important to remember that we haven't confirmed anything yet. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now, and the X-ray technician will get you set up as quickly as possible. It usually takes a day or two for the results to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a diuretic, a water pill, similar to what you took before, to help reduce the fluid buildup. It's a low dose to start, and we'll adjust it as needed based on the test results. It’s important to take this as directed, and to monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about the medication or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: A water pill again… I suppose that makes sense. I did well on it before, I recall. Monitor my weight… yes, I can do that. Sudden weight gain… alright. And contact the office… yes. Will the water pill interact with my vitamin D? I take a small dose every winter. And… will I need to see a specialist, if it is heart failure? I’m not fond of going to lots of different doctors.
DOCTOR: That's a good question about the vitamin D. No, a small dose of vitamin D shouldn’t interact with the diuretic. You can continue taking it as usual. And yes, if it is heart failure, I will likely refer you to a cardiologist, a heart specialist. They are best equipped to manage the condition long-term. I understand your reluctance to see multiple doctors, and I will do my best to coordinate your care and make the process as smooth as possible. We can discuss the specific cardiologist I recommend once we have the test results. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and seeing what they show. I'm writing the prescription for the diuretic now. The nurse will go over the instructions with you before you leave. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate you not rushing me. I really must get back to Mrs. Henderson’s plants… her African violets are very sensitive. Hopefully, this water pill will help. I'll contact the office if anything changes. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe the nurse is waving me over.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. And please, do give Mrs. Henderson's African violets my best. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
