DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My name is Lindra. Yes, um… my family, they want me to maybe go to a… a place for old people. A nice place. They say I need to… get okayed? For it. So, they send me here.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, your family is considering assisted living or a nursing facility for you, and they’d like me to do an evaluation to see if that’s appropriate?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That is right. Evaluation. I don’t… I don’t know much about it. Is that… is that bad? My daughter, she worry too much. But she good girl.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Ms. Abdollahi. It just means we need to figure out what kind of support you might need. Sometimes people need a little help with things as they get older, and these facilities can provide that. We'll just go over a few things – your health, how you’re doing day-to-day, things like that. It’s pretty straightforward. Now, let’s start with your health. Do you have any current medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical problems… I have old lady things, you know? My knees, they hurt sometimes. And my back. But everyone has that, right? I take a little pill for the pain, but not every day. And… oh! My blood pressure. The doctor, he say it go up sometimes. I take a pill for that too, when it is high. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees, back pain, and blood pressure. Those are good things to know. And you take medication for both?
PATIENT: Yes, pills for both. The little white one for my knees and back. And a little blue one when my blood pressure feel… funny. My husband, he help me remember. He is good with the pills. I forget sometimes. Not all the time, but… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you know the names of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no. I just know the color. My daughter, she write it on the bottle. I don’t remember the long words. Too many letters! I can show you the bottle, if you like? It’s in my bag.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t bother with the bag right now. Colors are fine for now. We can look them up later. So, besides the pain and blood pressure, are there any other health issues you're dealing with?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My eyes, they not so good anymore. I need glasses to read. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little tired. Very tired. But everyone get tired, right? Old people… we sleep a lot. And… oh! My feet! They swell up if I stand too long. Is that a problem? My mother, she had that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, vision changes, fatigue, and swelling in your feet. These are all helpful things to know. And the fatigue… is that just generally feeling tired, or is it interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: It… it make it hard sometimes. Hard to cook. Hard to clean. I sit down a lot more now. My daughter, she help with the cleaning. She say I need to rest. But I like to do things. Being still… it not good for me. I feel… useless. But I try to help when I can. I still make the coffee.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're still managing some things, but the fatigue is making it harder. Let's talk about your medications a little more specifically. You said you take a white pill for pain. How often do you take it, and how much do you take each time?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Not every day. Maybe… three times a week? When my knees really hurt. And… only one pill. A little white one. It help for a little while. But then the pain come back. My husband, he tell me not to take too many. He worry about my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay. And the blue pill for blood pressure…when do you take that?
PATIENT: Oh, the blue one… I take that when I feel… funny. When my head feels… tight. And my heart, it beat fast. My daughter, she check my blood pressure with that machine. When the numbers are high, she give me the blue pill. Maybe… once a week? Sometimes not at all. It depend. Is it bad to take it only when I feel bad?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking. Taking medication only when you feel bad isn’t ideal. Blood pressure can fluctuate, and consistently high blood pressure can be dangerous, even if you don’t feel anything. We really need to know how often it's elevated to manage it properly. Now, let's move on to something else. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… major illnesses… I had the flu, many times. And a bad cold last winter. But surgeries… yes! When I was young, I had my tonsils out. And… oh! I had a baby! Two babies, actually. Does that count as a surgery?
DOCTOR: Yes, childbirth counts as a surgery. Anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don't think so. Nothing else major. I broke my wrist once, when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But it healed good. My mother, she set it herself! Back in Honduras, we didn't have doctors for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Oh, they good people. My husband, he is here with me. We been married a long time. 50 years! And I have two daughters. One live close by, she help a lot. The other one, she live far away, in America. She come visit sometimes. My grandchildren, they good too. Always calling.
DOCTOR: And are there any major medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical problems… My mother, she had diabetes. And her heart was not so good. My father, he had trouble breathing when he got old. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. But that is all I can remember. Old people forget things, you know.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We can always get more information later if needed. Now, before we finish, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I never had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe… maybe a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp? But that is all. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, and overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. A physical… okay. My daughter, she always tell me to get checkups. She worry too much, but she good girl.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up here for me. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and another one. Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarming. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little high, as you know. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Anything tender here?
PATIENT: No, not tender. Just… old lady tummy. It feel… soft. Sometimes a little… gassy. But not today. Is my blood pressure really bad, Doctor? My daughter, she say I need to be careful. I don't want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: It's elevated, yes, but not immediately critical. We need to get it under better control, that's all. That's why it's important we find the right medication and make sure you're taking it regularly. Now, let's just quickly check your reflexes. Good, reflexes are normal. A little slow, but that's expected at your age. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within the normal range for someone your age, aside from the elevated blood pressure. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, you have some typical age-related issues – some pain, fatigue, elevated blood pressure. The question is whether these are manageable at home, or whether you would benefit from the extra support that an assisted living facility could provide. We need to do some blood work to get a clearer picture of your overall health. That will help me make a recommendation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that sounds alright. If it help you help me. I just want to be… okay. I don't want to be a burden. My daughter, she always say I worry too much. But I can't help it. Will the blood work tell you if I really need to go to a place? I like my home. It not fancy, but it is mine.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health, which will help us decide what level of care is right for you. It won't necessarily tell us you need to go to a facility. It'll just help me make a more informed recommendation, whether that's continuing to manage things at home, or exploring other options. I'll write you a lab order now. You can go to the lab downstairs anytime. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. The lab is downstairs? Good. I can walk downstairs. My legs, they work okay. I will go tomorrow, maybe? I need to tell my husband. He drives me everywhere. Thank you, Doctor. You not scary, like some doctors.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I'm glad I could help. Here's the lab order, and a list of instructions. Just take this with you. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, once the results are back. How about Tuesday afternoon?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes, that sounds good. My daughter, she has book club on Tuesday mornings. So afternoon is good. Thank you again, Doctor. You been very kind. I think… I think I am ready to go now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have the nurse escort you out. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Abdollahi. We’ll talk next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too.
