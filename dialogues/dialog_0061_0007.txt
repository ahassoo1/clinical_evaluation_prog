DOCTOR: Bula! And welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you, Lakiya. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It is nice to meet you as well, Doctor. I am here because I am having… a painful time. It has been going on for a bit now, and I thought it best to get it looked at. I would like to finish quickly if that is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lakiya. I understand wanting to get things sorted out as quickly as possible. “A painful time” can mean a lot of things, though. Could you tell me a little more about where you're feeling the pain?
PATIENT: It is in my back, Doctor. Lower back, mostly. Right around here… It feels like a dull ache, most of the time. But when I bend over, or try to lift something… it gets sharp. Really sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, mostly a dull ache, but sharp with bending or lifting. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: About three months now, Doctor. It started… slowly. I just thought I pulled a muscle. But it has not gotten better. It seems to be getting worse, if I am being honest. I do a lot of work with fences, and bending and lifting is… part of the job.
DOCTOR: Three months, and getting progressively worse with work… that’s good information. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It is not constant, Doctor. It is better when I am resting. When I am sitting or lying down, it is usually just a little ache. But as soon as I start moving, it gets worse. Especially if I am doing something… physical. Like putting up a fence. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with activity and improves with rest. Does anything specifically make it feel better, besides resting?
PATIENT: Nothing really, Doctor. I have tried some… creams. The ones you can buy at the store. They did not help much. And sometimes… a hot bath feels a little bit better. Just for a little while. But it always comes back. I do not know what to do anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, creams haven't helped, and a hot bath provides temporary relief. We should take a closer look. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam of your back?
PATIENT: That is fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want this pain to stop. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya. If you could just lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me, that would be great. We’ll start with just a visual inspection, and then I’ll gently feel along your spine and muscles. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you pain. Okay, I'm just gently pressing here and here… Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Yes. There. When you press right… there. It is a sharp pain. Not unbearable, but noticeable. And… a little bit to the left of my spine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about if I ask you to gently bend forward… and then backward?
PATIENT: It hurts when I bend forward, Doctor. A lot. It feels like something is pulling. And when I bend back… it is just uncomfortable. Not as bad as forward, but still… not good. I cannot bend over very far at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you try and side bend – gently leaning to the left and then to the right?
PATIENT: It is… difficult, Doctor. To the left is worse. I can barely go. And to the right… it is a little easier. But still not comfortable. It feels… tight. Like a muscle is pulled very tight. It is hard to explain. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Lakiya. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain – a pulled muscle in your lower back. The fact that it's worse with bending and lifting, and improves with rest, is consistent with that. However, given the pain level and the fact that it hasn’t improved over three months, we should get an X-ray to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture or arthritis. Would you be okay with getting an X-ray today?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes. If it will help me find out what is wrong, then yes. I do not want it to be something… serious. I just want this pain to be fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get that ordered right away. The X-ray will take just a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the pain and inflammation. And continue with the hot baths if they provide some relief. I'll have the radiology technician come in shortly to get you set up. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or are you pregnant?
PATIENT: No allergies to anything, Doctor. And no, I am not pregnant. I just want to get this over with. Quickly. Thank you for… taking the time to look at this. It has been… a long three months.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No allergies, not pregnant. Excellent. The radiology technician will be in shortly, and they will explain the procedure. After the X-ray, we’ll review the results together and discuss a plan. It’s good that you came in; we’ll figure this out. While we wait, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you had any previous back problems or injuries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. This is… new. I have worked with fences for many years, and never had a problem like this before. It just… started. About three months ago, as I said. I do not understand what happened. It is just… painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no previous back problems. That’s good to know. Any other medical conditions I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I do not take any… regular medicines. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache. And I have… Medicare. I am a widow. It has been… a difficult time. But I am healthy. Generally. Besides this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, just occasional pain relievers, Medicare, and a widow – I appreciate you sharing that, Lakiya. It gives me a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any family history of back problems, arthritis, or other conditions?
PATIENT: My mother… she had arthritis in her hands. But not her back. My father… he was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. I do not think anyone in my family had… back problems. I do not really… remember. It has been a long time. And I do not talk to many relatives anymore. It is… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mother with arthritis, father healthy. That’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I do not smoke. I do not drink. And I certainly do not use… recreational drugs. I have never touched them. I am a very… simple person. I just want this pain to be fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs. Thank you for being so open and honest with me, Lakiya. That helps me provide the best possible care. Okay, it sounds like we have a good picture of your health history. While we wait for the radiology technician, let me summarize everything and discuss the next steps. You’ve been experiencing lower back pain for three months, which is worse with bending and lifting and improves with rest. You've tried over-the-counter creams and hot baths with limited relief. The physical exam suggests a muscle strain, but we're getting an X-ray to rule out any other potential causes. Once we have the X-ray results, we’ll discuss a treatment plan which may include physical therapy, pain medication, and exercises to strengthen your back muscles. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright, Doctor. Physical therapy… exercises… if it will fix this pain, then yes. I am willing to try anything. I just want to be able to… work again. And not be in pain all the time. Please. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll work together to get you back to work and pain-free. I want to reassure you that most back strains improve with conservative treatment. I will make a detailed plan for you once we have the X-ray results. Oh, here’s the technician now. They’ll take you to get the X-ray. It shouldn’t take long. I’ll be right here when you get back to discuss the results. Just follow them, and let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Quickly, please.
