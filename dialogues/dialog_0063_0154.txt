DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mrs. Wease, if you could tell me in your own words what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, I suppose. They bother me. A lot. It keeps happening again and again, you see. It’s… uncomfortable. I don't quite recall when it started, honestly. It just… does.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” you say. A rather vague description, I must admit. Are we discussing frequency?
PATIENT: Frequency? Oh… um. Yes, I think so. I go… often. More often than I used to. And it burns, sometimes. Not all the time, mind you, but… enough to be a nuisance. I don’t understand what you mean by frequency, exactly. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It simply means how often you urinate, Mrs. Wease. A basic concept, really. And yes, increased frequency can indicate a problem. Now, besides the frequency and the occasional burning sensation, are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, well, when you put it like that… yes, I suppose I am going quite a bit. And… pain. Hmm. Not a sharp pain, no. It’s more of a… ache. Low down, you see. Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not. It’s difficult to explain. It doesn’t… stop me from doing things, but it’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: An “ache,” you say. Vague, as always. And how is your… output?
PATIENT: My… output? Oh dear. Are you asking… about how much? I suppose it's… normal? I haven't really been measuring it, if that’s what you mean. I just… go when I need to. Is something wrong with how much I'm going?
DOCTOR: It would be helpful if you could provide a more precise description, Mrs. Wease. However, nevermind. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh goodness. I… I don't think so. Not that I've noticed. Everything looks… normal, I suppose. Though, I haven't been looking specifically, you understand. It's just… water. I always assumed.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll need to rule out a simple urinary tract infection. I'm going to need a urine sample. I'll have the nurse come in and provide you with a container. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample – that is, start urinating, then collect a sample mid-flow. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A sample? Yes, that sounds… sensible. A “mid-stream” sample? Oh dear. Is that… difficult? I’m not very good at… instructions, you see. Will the nurse… show me? I don’t want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide the necessary instructions. It's quite straightforward, Mrs. Wease. Honestly, it’s not a complex procedure. I’ll also order a basic blood work panel. Just to be thorough. It will check for general inflammation. Don’t worry unduly, it’s likely nothing serious. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bee stings as a child, but that was a long time ago. And I had a bit of a reaction to some sort of cream once, years ago, but I don’t recall what it was for. Nothing serious, mind you. I just got a bit of a rash.
DOCTOR: Bee stings are irrelevant. A “bit of a rash” is also… unhelpful. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. Let me see… I take a little something for my joints, sometimes. An herbal… something. My friend recommended it. And… I take a multivitamin, every now and then. It helps with my energy, you see. But that’s all, I think. I try to avoid medications if I can.
DOCTOR: "A little something"... Mrs. Wease, this is precisely the sort of imprecise information that makes accurate diagnosis difficult. Do you recall the name of this “something” for your joints?
PATIENT: Oh dear, you're right. I'm terribly sorry. It’s… it’s blue. The bottle is blue. And it has… flowers on it. It’s from the health food store, down the road. Old Man Hemlock sells it. He’s very knowledgeable, you see. I really can’t recall the name. It just says… “Joint Support,” I think.
DOCTOR: "Joint Support," from Old Man Hemlock… Right. Well, that narrows it down considerably. I suppose we'll have to proceed based on limited information. The nurse will be in shortly with the urine container. After you provide the sample, we will send it to the lab. We’ll also draw some blood. I'll review the results and contact you if anything significant arises. Now, is there anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that's everything. I just want this waterworks issue sorted out, you see. It’s… tiresome. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Imprecise history… always the same.
