DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just… my eyes. They feel dry. Real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't bother me too much, but… well, that's why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dry eyes can certainly be bothersome, even if they aren’t severely painful. “A while now” is a little vague, so could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Maybe… six months? Could be longer. Time kinda… slips away when you get old, ya know? It's just been getting worse slowly. Not all at once.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand that, Mr. Pipolo. Time does seem to move differently as we get older. So, it’s been a gradual increase in dryness over the past six months, or so. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, sometimes things look a little blurry. Not all the time, just when I'm tired, I think. And it feels like… like somethin' is in my eye. Like grit. I rub 'em a lot. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts. Blurriness and the sensation of something in your eye – that “grit” feeling – are common with dry eyes. And rubbing your eyes frequently can sometimes make the dryness worse. Now, I'd like to ask a few more questions to get a better picture of what's going on. Have you noticed any changes in your vision besides the occasional blurriness?
PATIENT: Changes… Not really. Everything looks the same as always, I guess. I don't need glasses or anything. Used to be able to see a mile, but that was a long time ago. Now… just regular old age, I reckon. I don't think my vision's changed besides when I rub my eyes and it gets blurry for a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you don’t have any pain in your eyes, redness, or discharge, correct?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. Maybe a little… scratchy sometimes, but not pain. No redness that I’ve noticed, and no… what did you call it? Discharge? No. Just dry. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Not that I know of. Doc always said I was a tough old bird. Blood pressure was a little high once, but it went back down. No arthritis, no… nothin' really. I just work. Been a cement mason all my life. Hard work, but keeps you movin'. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Nope. Never needed 'em. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put a cast on it. That’s it. I’m a pretty simple fella, Doc. Don’t usually bother with doctors unless somethin’s really wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Used to take somethin' for my knees a long time ago, but stopped. Just… plain water mostly. And coffee, of course. Can't live without coffee. But that’s not a medicine, is it?
DOCTOR: No, coffee doesn’t count as a medication! Alright, Mr. Pipolo, and do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a problem. I used to be around a lot of dust when I was workin', but that wasn't an allergy, just… dusty. So, no. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, before we proceed with a quick examination, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mom and dad, they're both gone now. Long gone. I had a brother, but he… he didn’t live too long either. Lots of hard livin' in my family. I don't know nothin' about their… medical stuff. Didn't talk about things like that much back then. Just… folks got sick and… well, they got sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s not uncommon. Alright, Mr. Pipolo, let's move on to a quick examination of your eyes. I'm just going to check their surface, and I’ll also check your tear production. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tear production… Okay. Sounds… fancy. Just get it over with, Doc. I got things to do. Don't wanna be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and look straight ahead. I’m going to use a bright light to look at your eyes closely. This won't hurt. Okay, Mr. Pipolo, I'm just going to put a small strip of paper under your lower eyelid for a moment. Just relax and blink normally. Alright, the test is done. Based on the exam, your eyes do appear a bit dry, and the Schirmer test indicates you are producing fewer tears than expected. It’s consistent with dry eye syndrome. We'll need to look at some solutions. Do you have any trouble with other symptoms like foreign body sensation, or a burning/stinging feeling?
PATIENT: Burning… Sometimes, yeah. Like somethin's in there, rubbin' against it. Especially when the wind blows. Or when I'm lookin' at a bright light. Not all the time, but… yeah. And dust. Dust is bad. Feels like sandpaper. Foreign body sensation… yeah. That sounds about right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that confirms my suspicion. It sounds like you have moderate dry eye syndrome, likely exacerbated by your occupation and environmental factors. Now, there are several things we can try. The simplest approach is artificial tears. These are eye drops that lubricate your eyes. We can start with preservative-free drops, as preservatives can sometimes cause irritation. I'll also recommend using a humidifier, especially during dry seasons or when you're indoors with heating or air conditioning. Would you like me to write you a prescription for the artificial tears, or would you prefer to start with an over-the-counter option?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter. Don't need a fancy prescription. Just somethin' to make 'em stop feelin' so scratchy. Prescription sounds like… extra work. Just get me somethin' I can pick up at the store. And… is there anything else? I wanna get goin'.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. I'll write you a prescription for Systane Ultra, a preservative-free artificial tear that's readily available. I'll also give you some instructions on how often to use them – typically every few hours when your eyes feel dry. In addition to the artificial tears, I'd also recommend avoiding rubbing your eyes as much as possible, and wearing sunglasses outdoors to protect them from wind and sun. If the dryness doesn't improve with these measures, or if you experience any significant pain, redness, or vision changes, please come back to see me. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… thanks, Doc. I appreciate it. I'll get the drops and… try not to rub my eyes. I gotta get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pipolo. I'm glad I could help. Here’s the prescription. If you have any problems filling it or have any other concerns, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Please take care, and try to protect your eyes.
PATIENT: .
