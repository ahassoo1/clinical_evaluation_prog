DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. Why don't you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back... it's been botherin' me. Lower part, mostly. Feels kinda achy, you know? Not sharp, just… old. It's been goin' on for a while now, and it’s makin’ things difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Old” aches are often the most persistent. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s worse when I stand for too long. Or bend over. Even somethin’ simple like pickin' up somethin' off the floor. I used to be able to do anythin', but now… not so much. It just feels weak, like it's gonna give out. And I been hearin' somethin' about my bones… the doctor before, he said somethin’ about them gettin' thin? I forget the word he used.
DOCTOR: Right, right. It sounds like it's definitely impacting your daily activities, which is concerning. And you mentioned something about your bones... the doctor may have said "osteopenia" or "osteoporosis," conditions where the bones lose density. Do you recall when he mentioned this?
PATIENT: Osteo… osteo-what now? Sounds complicated. Hmm… let me think. It was… oh, maybe three, four years ago? He did some kind of scan, a picture of my bones. Said they weren’t as strong as they should be for a man my age. He talked about calcium, I think? And maybe vitamin D? I didn’t really pay much attention, to be honest. I just thought I was gettin' old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to dismiss things, especially when they don’t cause immediate trouble. Calcium and Vitamin D are important for bone health, definitely. And it’s good you recall having a scan done. Let’s talk about your current symptoms a bit more… besides the ache when standing or bending, are you experiencing any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain goin’ down my legs. Just in my back. It's mostly a dull ache, like a… a weight. Sometimes it feels a little stiff in the mornin', but that goes away after I move around a bit. It’s just… constant. Like a friend that won’t leave you alone, you know? And it worries me. I don't want to end up bedridden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Vankampen. That "constant friend" feeling is something I hear about often. It's good it doesn't radiate down your legs, that's helpful to know. Now, have you had any recent falls, or injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No falls, no. Nothin' like that. I’m pretty careful, I try to be. I haven't lifted anything too heavy lately either. I used to help my son with some work around his house, movin' furniture and such, but he told me to stop. Said I was too old. He’s a good boy, my son. But it’s just… this pain started before I stopped liftin'. It's just slowly gotten worse over time.
DOCTOR: I see. That's important information. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder taken out years ago, maybe twenty years. And I have a little trouble with my blood pressure, it goes up sometimes. My regular doctor keeps an eye on it. I take a little pill for it, every day. Other than that, nothin’ much. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about fifteen years ago. Best thing I ever did.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, monitored hypertension, and a history of smoking, but quit fifteen years ago – excellent. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... it’s a little white pill. I think… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. Just one a day, in the mornin'. And I take a vitamin pill too, just a general one. My wife used to make sure I took it, but… well, she’s not around anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for letting me know. So, Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat most anything, except maybe oysters. Never liked those. And I haven’t been around anythin’ that bothered my breathin’ or anything like that. I used to garden a lot, roses mostly. But my back… it makes that hard now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just have you lie down on the examination table, and I’ll check your back for tenderness, range of motion, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Happy to do whatever you think is best. Just tell me what to do. I’m gettin’ a little tired standin’ here anyway.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie on your stomach for me first, that would be great. I’ll start by gently palpating your lower back to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, here goes. Be gentle, Doctor. It’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I'm just feeling for any areas that are particularly sensitive. Okay, does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there… that’s it. A little bit. Not terrible, but… yeah, that's the spot. It feels kinda… achy, even when you're just touchin' it. Like a dull throb.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting some tenderness in that area. Now, could you gently try to bend forward and touch your toes, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little difficult. I can't reach my toes anymore, not like I used to. It feels tight in my back, and kinda… stiff. I can't bend over very far without it hurtin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. It appears you have some limitations in your forward flexion. Now, could you try turning your head to the left and then to the right, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: That's alright. No problem there. I can turn my head fine. Doesn’t bother me at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I don't feel any major abnormalities along your spine. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes in your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, that tickles.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are present and equal on both sides, which is good. Now, if you could roll over onto your back, that would be great.
PATIENT: Alright. Still a little tender, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Vankampen. We'll take it slow. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear and regular. Now, based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you have a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or sprain in your lower back. However, given your age and history of osteopenia, we need to rule out any other potential causes. I’d like to order some X-rays of your lower back to get a better look at the bones and rule out any fractures or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Hmm... sounds serious. But if you think it's best... then yes, alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Fractures... that doesn't sound good.
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious, Mr. Vankampen. It's always best to have a clear picture of what's going on. The X-rays will help us determine the cause of your pain and the best course of treatment. I’ll have my nurse schedule those for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting, bending, or twisting movements. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. It’s important to take it as directed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No liftin', no bendin'... and take the pills. Simple enough. What kind of pills are they? And will they make me sleepy? I need to be able to think clear.
DOCTOR: They're a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, Naproxen. It’s a fairly mild dose. Some people experience a little drowsiness, but it’s not common, and if it does happen, it’s usually mild. If you do experience significant drowsiness, please let me know immediately, and we can explore other options. It primarily helps to reduce inflammation and pain. We’ll start with a low dose, and see how you respond. Do you have any allergies to any other medications, beyond what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anythin', not that I can remember. I’ve taken aspirin before, when I had a headache, but that was years ago. No problems then. So, Naproxen… I’ll try it. Anything else I need to know? Will I be able to drive after takin’ it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the aspirin. Generally, you should be able to drive after taking Naproxen, as it doesn’t typically cause significant drowsiness. However, it’s always best to be cautious. If you feel at all impaired, please don’t drive. I'll also provide you with a handout outlining some exercises you can do to help strengthen your back muscles, once your pain subsides a bit. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the X-ray results and assess your progress. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Exercises, follow-up, don't drive if I feel funny... I've got it. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could help. Just remember to take things easy, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-rays and follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll see you in two weeks. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it. Stop.
