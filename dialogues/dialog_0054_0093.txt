DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I barely remember what I even told the receptionist. Something about not sleeping so well? And… feeling a bit out of shape, I guess. It’s all a bit fuzzy, really. It’s been a while since I’ve felt… proper. Not that it matters much, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Chanz. It happens. We can definitely sort things out. It’s good you came in. "Not sleeping well" and feeling "out of shape" are good starting points. Let's start with the sleep. How long have you been having trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Ugh, ages. Honestly? I couldn’t put a date on it. Probably… since things happened with my wife. It's all just blended together, you know? I get to bed, toss and turn… sometimes I drift off, sometimes I just… lie there. It’s not like I’m exhausted all the time, just… not rested. Like I didn't actually do anything while I was asleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been going on for quite a while, and it’s completely understandable that things have been difficult. Losing sleep after a significant life event like that is very common. When you do manage to fall asleep, about how many hours would you say you typically get?
PATIENT: Oh, not much. Four, maybe five if I’m lucky. Sometimes less. It varies. I used to be a proper eight-hour man, you know? Now... it's just whatever I can grab. I don't really try to get eight hours anymore. What's the point, if you just end up staring at the ceiling anyway? It’s not like I’ve got anything particularly demanding to do these days. Mostly just fiddling with instruments.
DOCTOR: Four to five hours, okay. And you mentioned "fiddling with instruments" - are you a musician, Chanz?
PATIENT: Musician? No, not really. I repair them. Tuners, mostly. Violins, cellos, that sort of thing. I had a shop in the city for years. Good money, it was. Quiet work, you know? Just me and the wood. Now I mostly do it from home, when people bring things to me. It keeps my hands busy, at least. Not that it's exactly strenuous, mind you.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Quiet, focused work… it sounds peaceful. And it's good you're still able to keep busy with it. Now, you mentioned feeling “out of shape” earlier. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s just… I don’t do much these days. Used to walk everywhere, city life, you know? Always on the go. Now it's mostly from the couch to the workshop, and back again. I’ve put on a bit of weight, I suppose. Nothing drastic. Just… softer around the edges. Used to be pretty trim, actually. Not that it matters much at my age.
DOCTOR: It absolutely does matter, Chanz. It's good you're aware of the changes. And it's completely understandable that your activity level has decreased. We can definitely talk about ways to address that, if you'd like. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… I get tired, I suppose. Not like, bone-deep exhausted, but… sluggish. And my hands ache sometimes. It's probably just from working with the instruments, you know? Fine work, it is. But… yeah, achey. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful, lately. Though, to be honest, I was always a bit rubbish at remembering things. It’s probably just age.
DOCTOR: Okay, hand pain, feeling sluggish, and some forgetfulness. It’s good you’re noticing these things. While it’s easy to chalk things up to age, it’s important to investigate, especially with the hand pain and the changes in your sleep. Now, when you say "forgetful," could you give me an example?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's the little things, you know? Like… I went to the shops yesterday for milk and… I completely forgot why I was even there when I got there. Just standing there, staring at the dairy aisle. Had to go home and check the fridge. And names… I struggle with names sometimes. People I’ve known for years. It's embarrassing, really. Not that I see many people these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, forgetting errands and struggling with names. It’s good you're able to recall those specific instances. That's helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I’m hungry, I suppose. Not much of a big eater, never have been. And like I said, I've put on a bit of weight, but nothing dramatic. A few pounds, maybe. It’s mostly just… softness. Not like I'm stuffing myself with biscuits all day. Though… now that I mention it, my wife used to make a lovely baklava.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant changes in appetite, and some weight gain. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, mumps… nothing serious. My wife… she had a bit of trouble with her blood pressure towards the end. But me? Nothing. I’m pretty robust, actually. Always have been. Though I do get these little aches and pains now, as I said. But I just put that down to age, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. That’s good to know. And I appreciate you mentioning your wife’s blood pressure issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been in hospital, thankfully. I'm not a fan of doctors, to be honest. Always felt a bit… unnecessary. But my wife insisted I get regular check-ups. She was always very sensible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. I understand your reluctance. We'll try to make this as efficient and comfortable as possible. Now, are there any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Never been much of a pill-popper. I take the occasional paracetamol for a headache, if I really need it. But that's about it. Not a fan of all those chemicals, you know? Prefer to let things sort themselves out naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Not a fussy eater, thankfully. Though… I don’t much care for coriander. But that’s a taste thing, not an allergy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Now that's a depressing topic. My father… he had a bad heart. Died young, he did. And my mother… she started forgetting things towards the end. Not sure what it was, just… faded away. And my wife’s grandmother… she had something with her memory too. It’s not a particularly cheerful bunch, my family, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart disease in your father, and some memory issues in your mother and wife’s grandmother. That’s important information. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… What does that even mean? Look, I mostly keep to myself these days. Lost my wife a couple of years ago. Used to go out with her, you know? Theatre, restaurants… Now I just potter around the house, fiddle with instruments, and avoid people. Not much of a social life, to be honest. I have a few neighbours, but… we just exchange pleasantries.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Chanz. I understand that losing your wife has been very difficult, and it's completely natural to withdraw after such a loss. And it's helpful to know about your current level of social activity. Okay, so to summarise, you've been experiencing trouble sleeping, feeling fatigued, some hand pain, and increasing forgetfulness. You've noticed a family history of heart disease and memory issues. And you've experienced a significant loss with the passing of your wife. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it can't hurt. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn’t mind. I haven’t really got anything pressing to do, but… I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment, just to check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not exactly a graceful performance, but… I didn't fall over, did I?
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Chanz. You did very well. No wobble at all, and your balance seems steady. Okay, so based on the physical exam, everything appears normal. However, given your symptoms—particularly the sleep disturbance, forgetfulness, and family history—I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. We’ll check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and look for any signs of inflammation. I also think it might be beneficial to do a basic cognitive assessment – a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. This will help us get a baseline and track any changes over time. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… fine. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking. And… questions? What sort of questions? I'm not good at puzzles, if that’s what you mean. I’m not particularly sharp these days, if I'm honest. But… alright. Go ahead. Just try to keep it simple, if you could.
DOCTOR: They're not puzzles, Chanz. Just simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills – things like remembering a few words, naming common objects, and doing some basic calculations. It's very straightforward. Okay, let's start with this. Can you please tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Ugh… today’s date? Let me think… It’s… August. Definitely August. Is it the 2nd? Yeah, I think it’s the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? It feels like all the days just blur together these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. August 2nd, 2025. That’s perfectly fine. Okay, and can you please tell me the names of three things you see in this room?
PATIENT: Ugh… three things? Right. Let me see… There’s a… a chair, obviously. And… a desk. And… that lamp. Is that three? They’re all rather… unremarkable things, aren’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Chair, desk, and lamp. Very good. Now, I’m going to ask you to remember three words. Please listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those. I’ll ask you to recall them later. Okay, now, let's move on to something different. What year do you think the Titanic sank?
PATIENT: Ugh… the Titanic. That was… a long time ago, wasn't it? I… I vaguely remember something about it from school. Let me think… Was it the 1910s? No… 1912? Is that right? I'm terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: 1912 is correct, Chanz. Very good. Now, let's see if you can recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Ugh… three words… right. Let me think… Apple… something about a table… and… penny? Is that right? Apple, table, penny. Did I get it right? I’m terrible at remembering things, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, you recalled all three words correctly! Apple, table, penny. That's excellent, Chanz. Based on this brief cognitive assessment, your memory and thinking skills appear to be within normal limits. However, given your concerns about forgetfulness, and your family history, it’s important to investigate further. The blood tests will help rule out any underlying medical causes. And I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to reassess your symptoms and discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A month… yeah, alright. A month sounds fine. As long as it doesn't involve too much fuss. And… what happens if the blood tests show something's wrong? What then? I don't really want to think about that, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question. If the blood tests show something abnormal, we’ll discuss the findings in detail and explore the possible causes. Depending on the results, we may need to do some further investigations, such as imaging scans or a referral to a specialist. But let's not jump ahead just yet. We'll cross that bridge if and when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on getting the blood tests done. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab at your convenience. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. And I'll also write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid, just to help you get a better night's rest while we're waiting for the results. It's not a long-term solution, but it may provide some temporary relief. Do you have any questions about the blood tests, the sleep aid, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Ugh… a sleep aid? I suppose it can’t hurt. And the blood tests… no, not really. Just… get it over with, I suppose. Try to be quick, alright? I haven’t got all day. And… thank you. For not making a fuss, I mean. It's been… alright.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chanz. I understand. We'll get it done as quickly as possible. And if you have any concerns or questions after the tests, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment in a month. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
