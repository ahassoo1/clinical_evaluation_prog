DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Land, things have been...well, a bit off, lately. I mostly wanted to talk about my stomach. It just hasn't been right for a spell. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don't even feel hungry after just a few bites of food. It's...worrisome, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that certainly sounds concerning, Raymonde. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A bit off” can mean a lot of things. Let's try to get a better understanding of what's going on with your stomach. When did you first start noticing these issues – the nausea and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates are… tricky for me now. Let me think… it started… maybe a couple of months ago? Around springtime, I reckon. It wasn't constant at first, just now and then. But it's been happening more and more lately. I used to have a good appetite, you see. Always did. Now...not so much. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more precise. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. A couple of months ago is a good starting point. We can work with that. It’s very common for things to become less precise with memory as we get older. And you said it's been happening more frequently lately. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, at first it would just be maybe once a week, or after a particularly rich meal. Now… almost every day, it feels like. Sometimes it's just a queasy feeling, and other times… well, I actually get sick. Not always, mind you, but enough to worry me. And it doesn't seem to matter what I eat. I tried sticking to bland foods, thinking that might help, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. Honestly, Doctor, it’s just…tiring. It takes the joy out of everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Raymonde. That does sound quite distressing, and it’s good you’re recognizing that it's impacting your quality of life. It's good you tried the bland diet, that helps us narrow things down. When you say “sick,” are you referring to vomiting?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, vomiting. I just didn’t want to be… graphic. It's not a pleasant thing to talk about. It’s usually not a lot, just… enough to leave me feeling weak and shaky afterward. And then, like I said, I just don’t feel hungry, even after I’ve… gotten rid of whatever was bothering my stomach. It's like my body just doesn't want anything to do with food. I used to love to cook for my grandchildren… now the thought of it just makes me feel…sad.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Raymonde. It's important for me to have a clear picture of what's happening. And it's perfectly alright to be uncomfortable talking about these things; it's part of my job to listen and help. Now, besides the nausea and vomiting, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, more so than usual. But at my age, who isn’t tired, right? I’ve also… lost a little bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. Oh, and sometimes I get a little…winded, just walking around the house. But again, that could just be my age catching up with me. It's hard to say, Doctor. Everything feels…off-kilter. Is that a real word?
DOCTOR: “Off-kilter” is a perfectly real word, Raymonde, and it describes exactly how you’re feeling. The fatigue and unintentional weight loss are important things to note, and not necessarily just related to age. It's good you mentioned them. Let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, land. That's a tough one. I’ve been to the doctor a fair bit over the years, you know. Getting old comes with its share of aches and pains. I had my gallbladder out years ago… maybe thirty years? And I was diagnosed with… well, the doctor said it was cancer a while back. It was in my… my breast, I think. I had treatments, and they said it was gone, but… sometimes I worry it came back. I forget a lot of the details, though. My mind just doesn't hold onto things like it used to. It was a long time ago, Doctor. A very long time ago. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Raymonde. You've shared very important information, and I appreciate your honesty. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and the history of breast cancer is crucial. Even if it was a long time ago, it’s important for me to be aware of it. Do you recall what kind of treatments you received for the breast cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was a long time ago, Doctor. I… I think I had chemotherapy. And… surgery, of course, to remove the lump. And then… radiation, maybe? It all feels like a blur now. I was so scared and sick during that time. My late husband, bless his soul, took such good care of me. He handled all the appointments and kept track of everything. I mostly just… tried to get through it. I don't remember the names of the drugs or anything like that. It was all so overwhelming. I’m sorry, I wish I could tell you more. My memory is just… patchy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Raymonde. It sounds like you went through a great deal, and it's understandable that details would be fuzzy after so many years. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had heart problems. She died when I was quite young, actually. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had… I think it was diabetes. She was always very thin and weak. And my brother… he had cancer too, a different kind than me, I think. He passed away a few years ago. We weren’t very close, but I remember my aunt telling me about it. It seems like there’s been a lot of sickness in my family, come to think of it. It worries me, Doctor. It really does. Does that help? I’m trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: It does help, Raymonde, thank you. Knowing about the family history of heart problems, diabetes, and cancer is important. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I take something for my blood pressure. It's a little white pill, I think. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And sometimes, when my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Just the regular kind you buy at the drugstore. And... oh! Sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter. My daughter tells me I need it. Other than that... no, I don't take much. I try to stay away from pills if I can. They never seem to do much good anyway. Does that cover it? I hope I'm not forgetting anything. It’s so easy to lose track.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Raymonde. The blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D supplement are all good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank the Lord. I used to get mosquito bites pretty bad when I was a little girl, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and nothing’s ever bothered me. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t have any sensitivities or anything like that. I can’t think of a thing. Does that help, Doctor? I think I’ve told you everything I can remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Raymonde. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, now I’d like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. I trust you completely. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I’ve been to doctors enough times to know the drill. Just… be gentle, if you would. My old bones aren't as strong as they used to be. And… if I flinch, please don’t mind. It's just… I get a little nervous sometimes. But I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. I'll be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. How does this feel?
PATIENT: Oh, that's...well, it feels a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… tight. Sort of like a knot. It's mostly on this side, I think. And… it feels a little swollen, maybe? I don’t know if that’s the right word. It’s just… different than usual. It doesn’t hurt when you press on it, but it feels… full. It’s hard to explain, Doctor. It’s just… not right. Does that make sense? I'm sorry if I'm not being very clear. It’s hard to describe what I’m feeling.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. You’re describing it very clearly. It’s good you pointed out the fullness and tightness. I’m also feeling a slight tenderness in your right upper quadrant. It feels like there’s a mild distention in that area. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope now. The bowel sounds are a little quiet. Now, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is 72 and your blood pressure is 130/80. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I'd like to order some blood work and an ultrasound of your abdomen. The blood work will help us check your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. The ultrasound will give us a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs in your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it will help figure out what’s going on, then I’m happy to do it. Blood work and an ultrasound… alright. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s just… tiring being sick all the time. When can I get it done? And… will it hurt? I’m always a little nervous about needles. But if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness about the needles, Raymonde. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and it’s usually over before you know it. The ultrasound is completely painless; it just involves a gel and a probe being moved over your abdomen. I can get the orders sent to the lab right away. They have locations both here in town and over in Oakwood. You can choose whichever is more convenient for you. As for the ultrasound, we'll need to schedule that. The radiology department is booked a little ahead, but I can get you an appointment for next Tuesday at 10 am. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10… yes, that should be fine. As long as I can get a ride, that’s alright. My daughter usually has some free time then. Yes, Tuesday at 10 sounds good. And… the lab… I think the one here in town would be easier. Closer to my house, you see. So… here in town. And no, I don't need a special diet or anything before the tests, do I? I always worry about those sorts of things. Just wanted to make sure. So… Tuesday at 10 for the ultrasound, and the lab here in town. Is that correct? I think I'm getting a bit muddled now. My mind just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely correct, Raymonde. Tuesday at 10 am for the ultrasound, and the lab here in town. You haven’t gotten muddled at all—you're doing wonderfully! And no, you don’t need any special diet or preparation for either test. Just come as you are. I'll have the orders sent electronically to both the lab and the radiology department. They'll be able to confirm your appointment when you call to schedule. Once we have the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting, please don't hesitate to call the office or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little better just knowing that we’re doing something about it. Thank you for listening to me, and for not making me feel like I was being silly. I worry a lot, you see. Old people do. But… thank you. I appreciate it. I’ll call to schedule the tests tomorrow. And I’ll be sure to let you know if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Raymonde. It's my job to listen and help, and I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a little. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I’ll see you next week to discuss the results. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: .
