DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Durig. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s… it’s about my skin, dear. And my eyes, I suppose. They’ve become rather… yellow. It’s quite unsettling, really. I believe the young man at the lab mentioned something about… the liver? It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, either, but pinpointing what’s wrong… that escapes me. Is this… is this serious?
DOCTOR: Yellow skin and eyes… that is something we need to look into. The lab mentioning the liver is… not entirely surprising, given those symptoms. But let's not jump to conclusions. "Not feeling yourself" is very vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, I tire easily. Much more than usual. And… my appetite has vanished. It’s difficult to explain. Everything seems… tasteless, even the things I normally enjoy. And there's a dull ache… somewhere around here, under my ribs on the right side. It comes and goes, but it’s… bothersome. I truly wish I could recall more details. It’s frustrating, even for me. Perhaps a list of medications would be helpful? Though I don’t take much these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, loss of appetite, tasteless food, and right-sided abdominal pain... that does paint a clearer picture. We'll need to get a full list of any medications, even if you don’t think they're relevant. And please, try to recall when these symptoms started. Was it gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… that is… difficult. I believe it began sometime in the spring, perhaps March or April? It was very gradual, I assure you. I simply attributed it to… old age, initially. A little less energy, a little less interest in food… one expects such things. But it has worsened, steadily, over the past few months. As for medications… let me think. Just my blood pressure pills, I believe. And… occasionally, something for my arthritis. I really must get organized. Is this… is this hepatitis, perhaps? I’ve heard such dreadful things.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis is one possibility, yes. But there are many causes for these symptoms, and jumping to conclusions won't help. Let’s stick to the facts. You said blood pressure pills and something for arthritis. What are the names of those medications, and what dosage do you take?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the names… that is the troublesome part. I believe the blood pressure one is… a white pill. Small, round… It begins with an ‘A’, I think. Amlodipine? Is that correct? I take five milligrams, I believe. As for the arthritis… it’s a yellow capsule. I take it as needed, when the pain is particularly bad. I honestly cannot recall the name. I apologize. I simply ask my daughter to refill them for me, and she handles all the details. Perhaps she could bring the bottles next time? Would that be acceptable?
DOCTOR: Anmlodipine 5mg… and a yellow capsule for arthritis, unknown name or dosage. It's… less than ideal that we don’t have precise medication information, but we can work with this for now. We'll need to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, feel your liver, and check for other signs. It’s standard procedure. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A physical exam… of course. I suppose that is sensible. My joints are rather stiff today, you see. It will take me a moment. Do be gentle, dear. And please, if I ask you to repeat something, do not hesitate. My hearing isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I need you to lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. We'll start with listening to your abdomen, then I'll palpate it. Just breathe normally. Alright… deep breath in… and out… Now, tell me if anything feels particularly tender when I press here.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… Yes, right there. A bit tender, yes. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It feels… a dull ache, rather like the one I described earlier. And… perhaps a little further to the right, just under the ribs. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, you see. It's not a sharp pain, more of a… discomfort. Is that helpful? I truly hope this isn't something serious.
DOCTOR: A dull ache in the right upper quadrant… that aligns with your symptoms, yes. The liver feels slightly enlarged, and there’s some mild tenderness. Your skin also appears jaundiced, which explains the yellowing. We need to run some blood tests to assess your liver function, check for infection, and rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver enzyme panel. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. I'll also order a bilirubin test to confirm the jaundice.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests… so many tests. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? Will I be… comfortable? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a luncheon scheduled next week, and… well, I wouldn't want to cancel it unnecessarily. I truly appreciate your attention to this matter, but I must admit, I am growing increasingly anxious. Perhaps… perhaps a sedative would be advisable before the tests?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Durig, I understand your anxiety, but a sedative is not advisable. It will interfere with the test results. And honestly, it’s a simple blood draw. As for the seriousness… we don't know enough yet. That’s why we’re running the tests. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something more significant. We need to rule out serious conditions like hepatitis, cirrhosis, or even a blockage in the bile ducts. The results usually take 24-48 hours. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Try not to worry unnecessarily before we have concrete information. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Mrs. Durig’s blood?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. 24-48 hours… I suppose that is all I can do… wait. I do wish I had brought my daughter with me; she’s far more organized than I am. She would have remembered all the medications, I assure you. Please, be gentle. And perhaps… perhaps a small glass of water afterward? My mouth feels rather dry all of a sudden. I truly hope this doesn't disrupt my luncheon plans. It’s a charity event, you see.
