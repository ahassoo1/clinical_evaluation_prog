DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I'm Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Eh? Consultation? Yes, yes. My son, he make the appointment. Said I need to… check things. Work, you know? Underground. Lots of dust. But I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Been working down there for… a long time. Longer than you been alive, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your son brought you in for a check-up, particularly with your work environment. That’s very good of him. “Dust” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about the type of dust you’re exposed to, and for how long have you been working in this environment?
PATIENT: Type of dust? How should I know the type? It’s… dirt. Stone dust. Coal dust. Whatever they’re digging up. Been down there… sixty years, maybe more. Lost track. Since I was a young man. Before your country even had… what do you call them… colored television. It’s a mine. Dust is what mines have. What kind of question is this?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to point that out, Mr. Bigger. My apologies. That was a poorly worded question. Sixty years is a very long time, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We're trying to get a better understanding of potential exposures to assess your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing over those sixty years?
PATIENT: Changes in my breathing? I breathe. Always have. Always will. Maybe a little harder when I get old, like anyone. But that's old age, not… dust. I still climb the stairs at home, don't I? And I still shout at the television when they mess up the football. So don't talk to me about breathing. It's fine. Everything's fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to hear you're still active and maintaining your independence. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath, even with normal activity?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. Everyone coughs. Especially in the winter. Wheezing… what does that even sound like? You mean like an old kettle? Look, I'm a strong man. Always been strong. I don't lie around wheezing. Shortness of breath… maybe when I’m running to catch the bus. But that’s because I’m running! This is… wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you’re quite robust, and that's excellent. Just to complete the picture, have you noticed any chest pain or tightness at any time?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never. Had a little trouble with my back, lifting heavy things, but that's just… old age. I’ve broken a few things in my life, working. Not my chest, though. My chest is strong. Like a lion. You are asking about things that haven’t happened. I am wasting a perfectly good morning sitting here answering silly questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. I apologize if these questions feel repetitive or unnecessary. We’re simply trying to establish a baseline and ensure your long-term health, given your extensive work history. Let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? What do those even mean? I eat my food, I sleep when I’m tired, and I work hard. That’s all. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to worry about things. Took pills for everything. I never did. Still don’t. I’m a simple man. Heart problems… maybe a little thump now and then, but nothing a good night’s sleep doesn’t fix. You young doctors and your fancy names for things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate to maintain your health through hard work and a good lifestyle. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Only when my son dragged me here today! No. Never been in a hospital. Had a few broken bones when I was younger. A little cut here and there. But I patched myself up. A strong man fixes his own problems. No need for fancy doctors and hospitals. Waste of time and money, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife is gone, God rest her soul. Had a son, he's the one who brought me here. He worries too much. A good son, but… too much worrying. That’s all. No other family close by. They all… moved away. To the city. Don't like the mines, they said.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. And it's good you have a son who cares for you. Now, with your work in the mines for so long, have you ever had any formal health checks related to your job?
PATIENT: Health checks? You mean like… they poked me with a needle once, a long time ago. When I first started. Said it was… for the dust. But that was sixty years ago! They don't bother with that anymore. Just told me to keep working. Mines need workers, you see. Don't care much about old men like me.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat anything. Everything. My wife used to make all sorts of things. Never had a problem. I am a strong man. My stomach can handle anything. No allergies. Never have. Just… strong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Thank you for answering my questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your current health. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect much. I'm a strong man. Everything will be fine. Just hurry up, I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. This might feel a little tight. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Mr. Bigger. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. I'm hearing a few crackles in your lungs. That could be due to a number of things, and we'll investigate further. Do you feel any pain when I press here on your chest?
PATIENT: Crackles? What are crackles? Sounds like my wife's old kettle again. No pain. Just… old age. Everything aches. I've been digging in the dirt for sixty years, what do you expect? Don't go making trouble out of nothing. It’s fine. Everything is fine.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. I'm just trying to be thorough. I don't hear any pain when I press on your chest, that’s good. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back if you can. Your abdomen sounds normal. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Maybe a little… at the end of the day. But that’s just… standing. Been standing for sixty years, what do you expect? I don’t sit around doing nothing. A man needs to work. Everything is fine. Stop poking me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary exam, your blood pressure is elevated, and I detected some crackles in your lungs. Given your long history of working in the mines, I’d like to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to get a chest X-ray and some blood work?
PATIENT: X-rays? Blood work? What for? You are just trying to find something wrong. I told you, everything is fine. I am a strong man. I don’t need your fancy tests. But… my son will want me to. He worries too much. Fine. Do the tests. But don't expect anything. It will just show I am a strong man.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bigger. These tests aren’t meant to find something wrong, but to get a baseline for your overall health. It’s a preventative measure, especially given your work history. I’ll write the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work now. The nurse will let you know where to go. In the meantime, I'd like to discuss a few things we can do to help manage your blood pressure. Would you be open to learning about some simple lifestyle changes, like reducing salt intake and getting regular exercise?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Exercise? I work for a living! That’s exercise enough. And salt? My wife used to put salt in everything. It tasted better that way. Look, I am an old man. You can’t change an old man. Just do the tests and let me go home. My son will fuss if I don’t get back in time for the football game.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. We can certainly start with the tests, and then we can discuss other options later if needed. The results should be available in a few days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review them. Here are the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it over with. And tell your nurse to hurry up. I have a football game to watch. And tell my son to stop worrying. Everything is fine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I’ll let the nurse know to expedite the process. And I’ll mention to your son that you're in good hands. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Young doctors… always poking and prodding… Everything's fine. Always has been.
