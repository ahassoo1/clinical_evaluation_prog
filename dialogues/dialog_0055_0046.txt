DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I've been having some…pressure on my bladder, and it's been bothering me for a little while now. It’s just…uncomfortable, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Pressure, you say. Hmm. And how long precisely is “a little while,” Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… about three weeks, I would say. Maybe a little longer. It started gradually, just a mild feeling, but it’s definitely become more noticeable in the last week or so. It's not painful, exactly, just…a constant feeling of needing to go, even when I don’t really need to.
DOCTOR: "Needing to go," is a rather vague description, Ms. Creagh. Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Oh, goodness. Well, I used to go, perhaps three or four times a day, normally. Now… it feels like every couple of hours, even if it’s just a small amount. And sometimes, even when I do go, it doesn't feel like I've emptied my bladder completely, if that makes any sense. I apologize, Doctor, I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It appears you've had no prior evaluations for this issue. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain alongside this increased frequency?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and my back has been fine. It really is just the pressure and the feeling of needing to go so often. I haven’t noticed any other symptoms, and I feel otherwise healthy. I've been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn't these days?
DOCTOR: And are there any changes to your diet or fluid intake that coincide with the onset of these symptoms?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… not really, no. I haven’t changed what I eat or drink significantly. I drink about the same amount of water as usual, maybe a little less in the evenings so I don't have to get up at night. I do drink coffee in the mornings, I suppose, but I’ve been drinking coffee for years, so I don’t think that’s new.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you experienced any vaginal discharge, itching, or odor?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no, Doctor. Nothing like that. Everything feels… normal, in that regard. I apologize for being so… descriptive. It feels a little awkward to talk about these things, truthfully. But I want to be sure I’m telling you everything.
DOCTOR: It is my profession to inquire about such matters, Ms. Creagh. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, and I go for my annual check-ups, but they haven’t found anything concerning in the past. I am married, and my husband is very healthy as well. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I did have my tonsils out when I was a child, a very long time ago, but that was… I believe in 1998? It was a very simple procedure and I recovered quickly. Other than that, nothing. I’ve always been a healthy person, truly. It’s why this is so worrying to me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, concerning your family history, are there any instances of bladder problems, kidney disease, or similar conditions within your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… My mother had some urinary tract infections when she was older, but nothing major. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, I believe she had some issues with her kidneys, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and my family doesn’t really discuss those things. It wasn’t common to talk about medical issues when I was growing up. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: It appears your record is rather sparse, Ms. Creagh. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medications if I can. Just a multivitamin occasionally, but I haven’t taken one in a while. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise, so I don’t feel the need for much else. I really don't like taking pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I suppose we should perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with an abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. I'm just going to press gently on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I do not feel any masses. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, but there is mild fullness in the suprapubic region. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No pain, just…a little strange feeling, perhaps. It’s not uncomfortable, just…different. I’m not sure if that helps. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Normal bowel sounds. Now, I'm going to perform a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Finally, I will perform a pelvic exam.
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam…? Is that absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I understand you’re doing your job, but… I wasn’t expecting that. Is there any other way to proceed?
DOCTOR: Ms. Creagh, a pelvic exam is standard procedure when evaluating urinary symptoms, particularly in women. It allows me to assess the external genitalia, vagina, and cervix for any abnormalities that might be contributing to your discomfort. It is necessary to rule out potential causes. However, if you are truly distressed, we can proceed with a urinalysis first. But it will delay a definitive diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh… well, if it’s really necessary… then I suppose so. I just… I’ve never had one before, and it makes me a little nervous. If you could just… explain what you’re going to do, that would be very helpful. And please… be gentle?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will explain each step as I proceed. You will lie on your back with your knees bent and feet apart. I will use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. It may feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Then, I will perform a bimanual exam, using two fingers to gently feel your uterus and ovaries. It will allow me to assess their size and shape. It is a routine examination, Ms. Creagh. I will be as gentle as possible. Now, if you will please… reposition yourself on the table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I’m ready… I think. Please… just let me know if anything feels… wrong. And thank you for explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. The exam is complete. There is some mild tenderness upon palpation of the cervix. It's not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I would like to collect a urine sample for a urinalysis. I will provide you with a cup. Please clean the area thoroughly and collect a midstream sample.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. A urine sample… right. Where is the restroom? And… is there anything specific I should do to collect a "midstream" sample? I apologize for asking so many questions, I just want to make sure I do it correctly.
DOCTOR: The restroom is just down the hall to your left. A midstream sample means you should begin urinating, then collect the sample midway through the stream. This helps avoid contamination from bacteria around the urethra. I have provided a sterile cup and collection instructions on the counter. Do you understand, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Begin urinating, then collect the sample midway through. I think I can manage that. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Ah, good. Now, let me run this urinalysis. It will take a few minutes for the results. Please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing while we wait? Or… are there any initial thoughts about what might be causing this? I know it's probably too early to tell, but I’m just… worried, truthfully. It’s difficult to concentrate when I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It is far too early to draw any definitive conclusions, Ms. Creagh. We must await the results of the urinalysis before proceeding. It will rule out a urinary tract infection, which is the most common cause of your symptoms. Other possibilities include cystitis, pelvic floor dysfunction, or, rarely, a more serious underlying condition. However, I do not wish to alarm you prematurely. Let us focus on the results first.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I understand. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if it’s just possibilities right now. I just… I’m not used to feeling this way, and it’s unsettling. I trust your expertise, and I’ll wait for the results. It's just...hard to think about the possibilities.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The urinalysis reveals a slightly elevated white blood cell count, but no evidence of bacteria. This suggests possible inflammation, but does not definitively confirm a urinary tract infection. The other parameters are within normal limits. Given these findings, it is likely that you are experiencing some form of non-infectious cystitis or pelvic floor dysfunction. However, to rule out other possibilities, I recommend a pelvic ultrasound. It will allow us to visualize your bladder, uterus, and ovaries in greater detail.
PATIENT: A pelvic ultrasound… Okay. That sounds… thorough. Is it painful? And… what exactly are we looking for with the ultrasound? I mean, you said non-infectious cystitis or pelvic floor dysfunction… are those serious? I apologize for all the questions, I just… I want to understand what’s going on, and what we’re trying to figure out. I’m starting to get a little worried.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is not painful, Ms. Creagh. A gel will be applied to your abdomen, and a transducer will be moved over the area. It sends sound waves to create an image of your pelvic organs. It is a standard diagnostic procedure. As for your concerns, non-infectious cystitis is generally not serious. It causes inflammation of the bladder lining, but it is usually self-limiting or responds to conservative treatment. Pelvic floor dysfunction can cause a variety of symptoms, including urinary frequency and urgency, but it is also treatable with physical therapy or medication. However, it is important to rule out other possibilities, such as a bladder tumor or other underlying condition. Therefore, the ultrasound is necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Do you consent to the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I… I consent to the ultrasound. If it’s necessary to rule out anything serious, then I want to do it. I just… I hope it doesn’t show anything concerning. And… how long will it take to get the results? And what happens after the ultrasound? Do I need to do anything specific to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: Very well. The ultrasound will be scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. You do not need to do anything specific to prepare for it, Ms. Creagh. You may be asked to drink water to fill your bladder. The radiologist will review the images and provide me with a report within 24 hours. Once I have the results, we will discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. It may involve medication, physical therapy, or further investigation, depending on the findings. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your patience with all my questions. I’ll be here tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Or anything I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: In the meantime, Ms. Creagh, simply maintain adequate hydration and monitor your symptoms. If you experience fever, chills, or severe abdominal pain, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, rest assured that we are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your discomfort. I will see you tomorrow. .
