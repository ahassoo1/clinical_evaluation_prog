DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest idea why I’m here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about not being able to see properly and… sounds being muffled. It’s terribly inconvenient, you understand. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you were scheduled for a general check-up due to some…changes in your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Changes is… a polite way of putting it. It’s rather alarming, actually. Everything seems… dim, and people are mumbling. Though, it could just be them, frankly. People rarely articulate these days. But my staff insisted… Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's try to be efficient. When did you first notice these changes in your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. It was sometime… recently? A few weeks, perhaps? Everything blends together, you know. I travel a great deal. And I’ve been rather stressed with… matters. Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep a meticulous log of every little… sensory issue. Is this necessary to pinpoint the exact date?
DOCTOR: It helps to establish a timeline, Ms. Julie, to understand how quickly these changes are progressing. Roughly, then – within the last month?
PATIENT: If you must have it… yes, within the last month. Perhaps a little longer. It’s not as if I’ve been ignoring it for years, Doctor. I'm a surgeon, you know. I notice things. It just hasn't been a priority. Luncheon is at one, and frankly, I'd like to be presentable.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness. Let me see… I’ve been a little… fatigued, perhaps. But I always am. Running a practice is exhausting, you know. And a slight… dizziness, on occasion. Though that could be the travel. Or just… getting older. Is that what you’re looking for? Some dramatic ailment? I assure you, Doctor, I’m quite healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and dizziness. Alright. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Hmm. Now that you mention it… there has been a faint… buzzing, I suppose. But it's intermittent. Barely noticeable. It could be the air conditioning, honestly. This building is quite old. Are we finished yet? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your ears, your vision, and do a brief neurological assessment to evaluate your balance. It shouldn't take long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be swift, Doctor. I have a reputation to uphold. And do be gentle; I haven't the time for discomfort. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lean forward. I’m going to take a look in your ears first. External auditory canal is clear. Tympanic membrane appears… slightly dull. Left tympanic membrane also appears slightly dull. Some cerumen present. There’s a bit of wax buildup in both ears. That could be contributing to the muffled hearing. Now, let’s check your vision.
PATIENT: Wax, you say? Honestly. I suppose one can’t expect perfection. Though I do employ a perfectly capable office manager. I assumed she'd address such trivial matters. Get on with it, Doctor. I haven’t all day.
DOCTOR: Please read the lowest line you can see on this chart. Reading is… somewhat labored, and she misses several letters on the fourth line down. Visual acuity approximately 20/40 in both eyes. Your vision is slightly reduced. Now, I'm going to test your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is rather undignified. I haven't done this since… well, never, actually. Please do hurry. I feel terribly unsteady. There. Are we finished now? I’m quite certain I’m perfectly capable, but this… charade is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, please open your eyes. Your balance is somewhat impaired. Alright, Ms. Julie. Based on what you’ve described and the brief exam, it appears you’re experiencing some hearing loss, reduced vision, and balance issues. It's difficult to determine the exact cause without further testing. It could be related to wax buildup, but the reduced vision and balance issues suggest something more systemic. I recommend an audiogram to assess your hearing more thoroughly, and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. I'd also like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any neurological causes for the balance issues.
PATIENT: An MRI? Good heavens, Doctor. That sounds… drastic. Are you suggesting I have a brain tumor? I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy. This is all rather unnecessary, don’t you think? Wax buildup and a slightly diminished eyesight. It happens with age. Really. I don't see the point of all these… invasive procedures. I think I'll get a second opinion. This luncheon is very important, you understand. And frankly, I haven't the time for all this fuss. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Julie. However, it’s my professional responsibility to investigate potential causes for these changes. While it may be simple, it's important to rule out more serious conditions. I will document your refusal of the recommended testing. I still strongly advise you to follow up with an ophthalmologist and audiologist. Here are the referrals. Please schedule appointments at your earliest convenience. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience any new symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Have a good day, Ms. Julie.
