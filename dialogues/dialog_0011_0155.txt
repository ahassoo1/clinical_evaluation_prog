DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for… a while now, I guess. Hard to say exactly how long. It’s just… annoying, you know? Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. Annoying is certainly a valid way to describe it. Could you tell me a bit more about this shaking?
PATIENT: More about it… hmm. Well, it’s not constant. It comes and goes. Seems worse when I try to do something… precise. Like, holding a cup of coffee, or… trying to tighten a screw. Things like that. I used to work with… well, water, mostly. Lots of pipes and… fiddly bits. It didn't bother me then, or I didn't notice it. Now… it does. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Jezik. It's common for memory to change as we age. The fact that it’s worse with precise movements is helpful information. Is the shaking in just your right hand, or does it affect your left hand as well?
PATIENT: Mostly my right. My left… I think it sometimes gets a little shaky too, but it's nothing like my right. Hard to say for sure. Honestly, I barely notice it on my left, if it even happens. It’s the right hand that’s the problem. Makes eating soup… a real challenge. And… well, lots of other things. I used to be quite handy, you know. Fixing things around the house. Not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. And is this shaking accompanied by any other symptoms, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… not that I’ve noticed. I get tired easily, but I always have. Old age, you know? And my… joints ache sometimes. But that's just getting old too, I suppose. No dizziness, no numbness, no… well, nothing else really. Just the shaking. It's not painful, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. Very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything that seems to make the shaking better or worse besides when you're doing precise movements?
PATIENT: That's a good question... I don't think so. Not really. Coffee doesn't seem to make it worse, which is a relief! I used to drink a lot of it, when I was working. Maybe… sometimes when I’m stressed? But I can’t say for sure. I don’t get stressed much these days. Everything’s pretty quiet. I mostly just… sit around. So, no, not really anything specific. It just… happens. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, I had my appendix out when I was young. And… I think I had pneumonia once. A long time ago. Other than that… not much. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, years. Decades, probably. I always figured I was healthy enough. Old bones, but… you know. I haven’t taken any regular medications, either. Just… aspirin, sometimes, for a headache. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. And have any family members been diagnosed with similar symptoms, such as tremors or shaking?
PATIENT: Tremors… hmm. My mother… she had shaky hands later in life, I think. But she just said it was from old age. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he wasn’t very steady on his feet, but I don’t know if it was a tremor or something else. Nobody really talked about these things much back then. It wasn’t like today, with all the… information. So, I really couldn’t say for sure. Sorry. My memory… it's just not what it used to be. I feel like I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Jezik, and I appreciate you sharing what you remember. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… oh dear. Well, I used to be married. Divorced now, a long time ago. No children. I worked at the water treatment plant my whole life. Mostly just me and the pipes, really. I don't have many friends left. Most have… passed on. I live alone. Quiet life, you know? I don't do much socializing. Mostly just… sit around and watch TV. It's… lonely sometimes, but I'm used to it. Is this what you needed to know? I'm not much of a social person, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Jezik. That gives me a good understanding. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I used to be careful about what I ate, but… these days I don’t bother much. I'm not a picky eater. No hives, no swelling, no… nothing. I’ve never had an allergic reaction in my life, as far as I can remember. I think I'd know if I did, wouldn't I? I'm starting to feel a bit tired, if you don't mind. Can we wrap this up soon?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your hand tremors. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical examination? Well… alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I haven’t had one of those in… well, I can’t even remember. I'm not a fan of doctors poking around, but… if it will help, I guess. Just be gentle, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'd like to check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Alright. There. Like this? It's… it's shaking a bit more now that I'm focusing on it. Honestly, it's embarrassing. I try to hold my hands as steady as possible, but it's difficult. Is this what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, this is helpful. I see a resting tremor primarily in your right hand. It's present even when your arms are relaxed, and seems to lessen somewhat with intentional movement. Now, could you please touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: There… It’s… it's hard to be precise. The shaking makes it difficult. See? It’s not a smooth movement. It’s… jerky. I feel a bit foolish doing this, to be honest. I used to be so steady. This is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Jezik. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Like this? It's… a little difficult. I feel a bit wobbly. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. I used to walk miles every day, but… that was a long time ago. I’m worried I’m going to fall. Is this what you’re looking for? I'd like to sit down now, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, thank you. That was helpful. Based on your history and the physical examination, it appears you have a resting tremor primarily affecting your right hand, with some mild slowing of movement. It is important to rule out other potential causes, and further evaluation is warranted. I would like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any metabolic abnormalities. I would also like to schedule a neurological consultation with Dr. Ramirez. She is a specialist in movement disorders and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests and… a specialist? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I just want to know… is it something I should be really worried about? I don’t like the sound of this at all. I just wanted someone to tell me why my hand is shaking, not… all of this. But, alright. If you think it's necessary. Just… please explain everything to me, okay? I don't understand all this medical talk. And… how long will all of this take? I'm an old man, Doctor. I don't have a lot of time left.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik, and I apologize if this sounds alarming. It’s important to be thorough and rule out any serious underlying causes. While it’s too early to say definitively, these symptoms could be indicative of Parkinson’s disease, but many other conditions can cause similar tremors. The blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes. Seeing Dr. Ramirez is the best way to get an accurate diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action. The blood tests should only take a few minutes, and the results should be back in a few days. Scheduling an appointment with Dr. Ramirez may take a week or two, depending on her availability. I want to assure you that we will proceed at your pace, and I will explain everything to you in plain language. We'll discuss all your options and make a plan that is right for you. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Alright. A week or two… I suppose that’s alright. Better to know, I guess. Parkinson’s… that doesn’t sound good. My mother… she had some trouble moving towards the end. Is that what this is? Please… don’t give me medical jargon. Just tell me… will I end up like her? And… will these tests hurt? I hate needles. Just… please, take it slow. And explain everything. Like you promised. This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly natural to be worried. It’s important to remember that everyone experiences Parkinson’s disease differently, and a diagnosis doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll follow the same course as your mother. There are many effective treatments available that can help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life. As for the blood tests, they involve a small needle prick to draw a sample of blood. It’s usually a quick procedure, and most people don’t find it very painful. We can apply a numbing cream beforehand if you’re particularly concerned about the discomfort. To reiterate, the blood tests will help us rule out other potential causes of your tremors, such as thyroid problems. If those tests are normal, we'll schedule a consultation with Dr. Ramirez. She will perform a more detailed neurological examination and may recommend additional tests, such as a brain scan, to confirm the diagnosis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Numbing cream… that sounds good. And… brain scan? That sounds… scary. But I suppose I have no choice, do I? If it will help… I’ll do it. I just… I don’t want to end up completely helpless. I like my independence. I still want to be able to… fix things. Do… do these treatments have side effects? I don’t want to be worse off than I am now. And… how much will all this cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know. This is all very… overwhelming. Just… please, Doctor. Take it one step at a time. And explain everything. Like you promised. I’m an old man. I don’t have a lot of energy left.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Jezik. It is overwhelming, and you are right to ask these questions. We will take it one step at a time. Let’s start with the financial aspect. I will have the billing department contact you with an estimate of the costs for the blood tests and the neurological consultation. They can also explore any financial assistance options that may be available to you. Regarding the treatments, yes, medications for Parkinson’s disease can have side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, or sleep disturbances. However, Dr. Ramirez will carefully weigh the benefits and risks of each medication and tailor the treatment plan to your individual needs and tolerance. We will start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, while closely monitoring for any side effects. The brain scan, if needed, is a non-invasive procedure that uses magnetic waves to create an image of your brain. It doesn’t involve any radiation and is generally considered safe. For now, let’s focus on scheduling the blood tests. I will have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw the sample. She is very gentle and will explain everything to you before she begins. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. Sarah… gentle, you say? That’s good. I suppose. Blood tests first… that’s… manageable. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… she’ll explain everything? I hate surprises. And… will I have to fast beforehand? I had a big breakfast this morning. Just… please, tell Sarah to be gentle. And to explain everything. I’m an old man, Doctor. I don’t bounce back like I used to. I think… I think that’s all for now. Thank you… for being patient with me. This is all very… frightening. But… I appreciate you explaining everything. Like you promised. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I will personally speak with Sarah and ensure she is gentle and explains everything to you thoroughly. You do not need to fast before the blood tests, but it's best to stay hydrated. I will let Sarah know you're ready when she's available. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions. We are here to support you every step of the way. .
