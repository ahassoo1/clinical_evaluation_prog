DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, well. I suppose it’s… the library. It’s become quite dreadful, really. A lot of… noise. And students. Always asking questions. It’s quite disruptive to the order of things. I’ve been… teaching for a long time, you see. A very long time. It used to be respectful. Now… now it’s just… a bother. I trust this won’t take long. I have cataloging to attend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed by changes at the library, and that’s impacting your ability to focus on your work. That can be really frustrating. Just to be clear, though… are you experiencing any physical symptoms alongside this stress?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Good heavens, no. I’m not one for… complaining about aches and pains. A little tiredness, perhaps. But that’s to be expected at my age. It’s the mental strain, you see. The constant… interruptions. The sheer volume of… requests. It’s simply unacceptable. Are we finished now? I really must… prioritize.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mostly mental strain, feeling overwhelmed, and some fatigue. Just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Sleep? Oh. Well, I suppose I do wake up a bit more than I used to. But that’s just… old age creeping in. And appetite… I eat. Yes, I eat. Usually something light. A bit of yogurt, perhaps. I haven’t noticed any… drastic changes. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to fuss over such details. It's the library, I tell you. It’s the root of all this trouble. Can we please focus on that?
DOCTOR: Alright, I hear you. It sounds like the changes at the library are causing a lot of disruption and stress. To help me understand better, and rule out anything else contributing to how you're feeling, let me ask a few more general health questions, if that's okay?
PATIENT: General health questions? Really? Must we? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy for my age. I’ve always been a… a meticulous person. Very disciplined. I take my vitamins. I avoid… unnecessary exertion. It’s the environment that’s detrimental. The students. The noise. The… the chaos! Honestly, this is wasting my time. If you simply told me how to… restore order to the library, that would be much more helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting to focus on the library situation. But just to be thorough, could you tell me quickly if you have any medical conditions—like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Good heavens, no! I’ve never been afflicted with such… common ailments. My father lived to be ninety-five, a very active man. We have good genes, you see. I assure you, Doctor, I am not prone to… weakness or illness. I keep myself… composed. It's the stress—the incessant disruptions—that's the issue. Are we quite finished now? I have a backlog of Dewey Decimal revisions to tackle.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, that’s good to know about your family history and your overall health. To get a clearer picture, and just to rule things out, would you mind if I do a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Absolutely not. I am not here to be… prodded and poked. I came to discuss the library, not to endure… indignities. Honestly, Doctor, I find this quite… unprofessional. If you are unable to assist me with the library issue, I shall seek assistance elsewhere. I have a great deal of important work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Erle, I understand your reluctance. You’re understandably frustrated, and you want to focus on solving the problem at the library. It sounds like this is causing you significant distress, and honestly, that's what I'm concerned about. Sometimes stress can manifest in ways that are helpful to address. Would you be open to discussing some strategies for managing stress and coping with difficult situations, even if it's just to explore options?
PATIENT: Strategies? Coping mechanisms? Honestly, Doctor, I've been coping for eighty-seven years! I am a librarian. Order is my profession. Discipline is my life. The problem isn’t with my coping skills; it’s with the… the unruliness of the students! They simply have no respect for… for the sanctity of knowledge! Look, I appreciate you trying to… assist, but I believe my time would be better spent implementing stricter regulations at the library. Perhaps a mandatory silent study hour? A more rigorous cataloging system? If you could perhaps offer advice on those matters, that would be… beneficial. Otherwise, I believe I’ve wasted enough of your valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. I understand you’re very focused on restoring order at the library, and you have a clear idea of what needs to be done. I can certainly see how important that is to you. Implementing stricter regulations sounds like a good starting point. However, based on what you've told me, it sounds like this is causing you a significant amount of stress and anxiety. While I can't directly address the library situation, I would strongly recommend speaking with a counselor or therapist who could help you develop coping strategies for dealing with the frustration and overwhelm. Would you like me to provide you with some resources for mental health professionals in the area?
PATIENT: Counselors? Therapists? Absolutely not! I have no need for… emotional coddling. I am a perfectly rational and composed individual. Honestly, the very suggestion is… insulting. Look, I appreciate your… concern, but I believe I’ve made my position perfectly clear. I simply want to restore order to the library. If you are unable to offer any practical solutions to that end, I shall take my leave. I have a backlog of overdue notices to prepare. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Erle. I respect your decision. I wish you all the best in restoring order to the library. If you ever do change your mind about exploring additional support, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Here’s a brochure with some local resources, just in case. Have a good day.
