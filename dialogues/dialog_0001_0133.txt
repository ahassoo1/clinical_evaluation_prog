DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia, good to see you... or at least, recognize the name. Seventeen years in this practice and they all start to blur together. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too, I suppose. Seventeen years, you say? My goodness. Um, I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms. I need them notarized, I think is the word? For… well, for some things. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Papers. Right. Of course. Look, I'm a doctor, not a notary. I can fill out medical history forms, sure, but I don't do… official document signing. It’s a liability thing. But, if these are health forms... let's just get through this, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. I… I thought this was where I could get them done. I don't have insurance, you see, and places charge a fortune. Are you sure you can't just… look them over and say they're alright? They’re just confirming things like my blood pressure and… and that I don't have any strange illnesses. It's mostly for a program, not a real medical thing, I don't think.
DOCTOR: A program?
PATIENT: Yes, a program. It’s… well, it’s for a senior living community. They need all sorts of forms, and I need to prove I’m healthy enough to get in. It’s a new place, and they're very thorough, apparently. They sent me a whole packet! It's just… a lot, and I thought a doctor’s signature would make it easier. I wouldn’t know what to put on them myself, really.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand it's a hassle, but filling out forms for a senior living community isn’t exactly practicing medicine. I can briefly review your chart—though frankly, there's not much in your chart—and we can take a quick look at your vitals, see if anything jumps out. But I’m not signing off on anything just because you need to get into a place. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, perfectly clear. I… I apologize for the trouble. It’s just… getting older is hard, you know? Everything feels like a mountain. A quick look at my vitals would be wonderful, thank you. And if you see anything concerning, maybe you can just write that down on the forms? Would that be alright? I’m truly sorry to take up your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's get this over with. Have a seat. I'll need your height and weight first, just to confirm what's on the…minimal record here. Then we'll do blood pressure and pulse. Don’t expect a full workup. This is just a quick check. And frankly, if I find something serious, you’ll need to go somewhere else for proper evaluation. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Perfectly. My height… I'm rather tall, actually. Around six foot two, I think. And weight… oh dear. It fluctuates. Around a hundred and ten, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. It's a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Six foot two… one hundred and ten pounds. Alright. That's… concerningly low for your height, but we’ll see what the blood pressure says. Roll up your sleeve, please. I’m going to take your pulse and blood pressure now. And please, try to relax. Anxiety will just throw off the readings.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do try to relax. It’s just… easier said than done these days. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: One-forty over ninety… pulse is sixty-two. Hmm. Blood pressure is elevated, pulse is normal. Alright. Not ideal, but not a crisis either. It could just be white coat syndrome… or a bad day. Alright, anything else you want me to look at while I'm here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… is my blood pressure bad? Should I be worried? It's probably nothing, I just… I get anxious at the doctor's office, like you said. I suppose if it's alright, could you just write on the forms that I've had my vitals checked today, and my blood pressure is a bit high, but I get nervous? Would that be acceptable?
DOCTOR: Fine. I can write that. "Patient reports anxiety at doctor's office. Blood pressure slightly elevated at time of exam." There. Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly sufficient. Thank you so much. You’ve been very… patient with me. Could I just have a pen, please? I can sign them myself.
DOCTOR: There. Just… try not to take up too much of my time with this. And frankly, if you start developing any actual symptoms – chest pain, dizziness, blurred vision – go to the emergency room. Don’t wait. I’ve said what I need to say. Now, if there’s nothing else…
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No, that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Pehrson. You've been a great help. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Finally. You too. And try to get some rest. .
