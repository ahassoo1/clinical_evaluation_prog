DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh... well, it's about this... tryout. For the team. I need... the paper. To say I'm okay to play. It’s a formality, really. Not much to it, I figure.
DOCTOR: A tryout?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For the... well, it's a baseball team. A local one. It's not the big leagues, if that's what you're thinking. Mostly just for... staying in shape. And the boys. Good boys. Need to fill out some forms, that’s all. It's been... a while since I had this done. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time.
DOCTOR: I see. And you're requesting a physical clearance for this team. While it may seem like a formality, Mr. Bartok, we still need to ensure you are healthy enough to participate. Even recreational sports carry risks. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical... conditions? Hmm. That's a... a good question. I had something once, a long time ago. Back problems, maybe? Or was it my knee? Honestly, Doctor, it was years ago. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Old age, mostly. Everything aches a little these days, you know? Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: "Old age" is not a diagnosis, Mr. Bartok. We need specifics. Do you recall when you experienced these back or knee issues?
PATIENT: Specifics... That's... difficult. A long time ago. Before... the divorce, maybe? Or after? It was definitely... before I started using that new cream for my hands. No, wait. It was when I was still doing... construction. Yes, construction. That was it. Lots of lifting, heavy things. I remember that. But when exactly... I couldn’t tell you the year. It was… a long time ago, Doctor. Truly. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently experience any pain in your back or knees?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, not constant pain. It’s more of a… stiffness. Especially in the mornings. And after I’ve been… doing things. Like, moving boxes, or… gardening. Nothing you’d write home about. Just… old man stuff, you know? I take some… pills sometimes. The white ones. But I can’t remember what they're for, honestly. My daughter used to help me with that.
DOCTOR: "Old man stuff" isn't a sufficient medical history, Mr. Bartok. You mentioned "some pills." Can you describe them further?
PATIENT: Hmm... white pills. Small, I think. Round. No, maybe oval? About… this big. And they... they help. With the aching. In my… joints. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention. My daughter always filled the container. She's very good with those things. It’s been a while since I’ve seen her, you know. She moved away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try a different approach. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies... Now that I should know. Hmm. Let me think... I don't think so. I eat just about anything. My ex-wife used to say I had a stomach of iron. Maybe… maybe a little itchy sometimes? After I eat shrimp. But that’s just… a little rash. It goes away. Not a serious allergy, you know. I wouldn’t say I’m allergic to anything important.
DOCTOR: "A little itchy" after eating shrimp could indicate a shellfish allergy, Mr. Bartok. Even mild reactions can escalate. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doctor, what do you think I am? I used to drink a little beer sometimes. Back in the day. With the boys. But not anymore. My stomach doesn't handle it like it used to. And no, I definitely don’t smoke. Never touched the stuff. Bad for you, you know? I was always a healthy man. Or, I try to be, anyway. This old body’s just… wearing out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your range of motion. This is necessary to determine if you’re physically fit to participate in baseball. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? Doctor, now hold on a minute… I don't see how taking off my shirt is going to help me play baseball. And frankly, it’s a little… undignified. Isn't there some other way to tell if I'm fit enough? A paper, perhaps? Or… a simple conversation? I'm telling you, I'm a healthy man! Mostly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, I am a physician. A thorough physical exam is standard procedure when evaluating someone for physical activity. I need to assess your cardiovascular health, lung function, musculoskeletal system, and overall condition. I cannot ethically clear you for a sport without it. It's not about whether you feel healthy, it's about ensuring your safety. If you refuse to cooperate, I will be unable to provide you with a clearance. And frankly, participating in baseball without medical evaluation would be… irresponsible.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t go looking for anything. It’s just… an old man’s body. And I’m telling you, it's probably just stiffness. Overreacting, that's what it is… Hurry it up, will you? I haven't got all day. .
DOCTOR: Please turn around and face away from me. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Breath sounds are… diminished bilaterally, with some mild wheezing on auscultation. Blood pressure is 145/90. Elevated. Pulse is 82, regular. Soft, non-tender. Range of motion in shoulders is limited, with discomfort on external rotation. Knees have crepitus, but full range of motion. Alright, you can turn around now. No apparent rashes or lesions, but mild edema in the knuckles.
