DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well… family. Lots of family problems with… sickness. My mother, she had… something with her heart. And my brother, he… well, he didn't live very long. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Get some peace of mind. It's been on my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's wise to be proactive, especially with a family history of illness. We'll certainly do what we can to assess your current health. Let’s start with your mother’s heart condition. Do you recall what specifically was wrong with her heart?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Something with the valves, I think? The doctor said something about… not pumping right. It was a long time ago. I was just a boy. She was sick for a while, then… gone. I don’t remember much detail, sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not bad, Mr. Schwer, it’s simply… less information for us to work with. These things happen. Vague recollections are common. Alright. And your brother?
PATIENT: He… got sick fast. Real fast. Some kind of… fever, I think. And then… he just… stopped breathing. He was young, too. Not even forty. It scared my whole family. They said it was… something with his lungs, maybe? I don't know. It was a long time ago, and nobody talked about it much after. It was too sad.
DOCTOR: I see. A sudden illness is always more difficult to process. So, to clarify, both your mother and brother’s illnesses were… relatively early onset, and you’re understandably concerned about your own risk. Have you experienced any similar symptoms – fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but… I’m seventy-three. I figure that’s just getting old. No chest pain, no trouble breathing. I walk pretty good for my age. I sell things, you know? Lots of walking. So, I think I’m okay. But… that’s why I came. Just to be sure. Is there a test or something you can do?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. We can certainly run some tests. Before we order anything, let’s go through a more detailed medical history. It will help me to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, but that’s it. The doctor gave it to me a few years back. Everything else… I just try to stay healthy. Walk a lot, eat my vegetables. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what is the name of the blood pressure medication you are taking?
PATIENT: Uh… now that’s a good question. I… I don’t remember. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning. I just… get the refill from the pharmacy. I don’t pay much attention to names, you know? I just take it when I need to. Is that bad? Should I know that?
DOCTOR: It’s… preferable to know what medications you're taking, Mr. Schwer. We can look it up. Do you recall the name of the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's… Miller's Pharmacy. Down on Main Street. Old man Miller used to own it, but his son runs it now. They know me pretty well there. They give me the white pills every month. Maybe they can tell you the name? Would that work? I'm really sorry I don't remember. I'm not good with names.
DOCTOR: Yes, that will work. We can verify the medication list with the pharmacy. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine care?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, except when I was born. And… when I broke my arm when I was a kid. That was a long time ago. Nothing serious. Just a little fracture. They put it in a cast. That’s it. I've been pretty lucky, I think. Mostly just colds and the flu.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history beyond your mother and brother?
PATIENT: Uh… my father, he lived to be eighty-something. He had… diabetes, I think. And… my sister, she had high blood pressure, like me. And… uh… my wife… she had… well, she had some kind of trouble with her stomach. She's gone now. Passed away a few years back. That's about all I can remember. It was a big family, but… my memory isn't what it used to be. Is that okay? Am I telling you enough?
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Mr. Schwer. We’re gathering what we can. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. Don't like the smell. And… I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but not anymore. Not for years. Just a glass with dinner, now and then. But mostly, I drink water. Gotta stay hydrated, you know? And… no, no other substances. Just the blood pressure pill. And water. Is that good enough? I'm trying to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… helpful. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just tell me if anything is wrong. I'm a little nervous, but… I trust you. Just want to make sure I'm okay.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Reflexes are normal, and abdomen is soft. Overall, you appear reasonably healthy for your age, but we need to investigate this murmur and elevated blood pressure further. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to get a better look at the structure of your heart.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is something really wrong? I just wanted to be sure, you know? I don't want anything bad. What do these tests… show? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Schwer. These tests are simply to gather more information. The murmur could be benign, and the elevated blood pressure needs to be managed. The blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health, and the EKG and echocardiogram will help us assess your heart function. The blood draw will be a slight pinch, and the echocardiogram is non-invasive – it uses sound waves, like an ultrasound. It won't hurt. We're being thorough. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and schedule the echocardiogram for next week. In the meantime, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I'll give you a list of instructions. If it consistently reads above 140 over 90, call the office.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That… that sounds better. Monitoring it at home… I can do that. My neighbor, old Mr. Henderson, he has one of those machines. Maybe I can borrow it. And… you'll explain the results when they come back? I just… I just want to know what's going on. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any special diet or… exercise?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll explain the results thoroughly when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend a low-sodium diet and moderate exercise. Walking is excellent. Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the echocardiogram. And… try to reduce stress. Here are the instructions for home blood pressure monitoring, as well as a list of foods to avoid. I'll have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. Thank you. You’ve been… very helpful. Even though it’s a little scary. I appreciate you taking the time. I'll try to keep calm and walk a lot. And borrow that machine from Mr. Henderson. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Schwer.
